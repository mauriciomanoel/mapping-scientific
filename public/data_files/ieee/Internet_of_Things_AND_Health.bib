abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage. The analyzed sensor data is sent back to the mobile application on the smartphone for real-time visualization if required.},

Smart cities make up one of the major areas of IoT applications. Despite several definitions for this new concept, the aim is to achieve a better use of public resources by increasing the quality of services and decreasing the costs of public services. Some initiatives of smart cities around the world have become reality, such as in [1]. Many smart components compose a smart city, such as transportation, energy, education, and buildings. A smart building includes services offered to the occupants, resources distributed to the city, and, in the case of historical buildings, information provided to municipalities about their state of health.},

abstract={Electrical transformers are the important elements in the process of transmission and distribution of electricity. Transformer is one of the important and costliest components of electrical industry. As we know, Distribution Transformer is a major component of power system and it's correct functioning is vital to system operations. This paper presents the development of a mobile embedded system, to monitor and record parameters of a distribution transformer like Current, Temperature, Rise or Fall of Oil level, Vibration and Humidity. Remote terminal unit is installed at the distribution transformer site and above parameters are processed and recorded using-in-8-channel analog to digital converter (ADC) of the embedded system in the system memory. If any abnormality occurs, the system sends alert messages to the mobile phones as well as monitoring units which containing information about abnormality to some predefined instructions programmed in the microcontroller. Also it is important to keep an eye on transformer health when operator is not present at transformer site, so we are introducing embedded system named as two way communication systems between transformer and operator. This system is designed to send alert messages, whenever related parameters value exceeds the predefined limits. This system proposes a compact design and development of remote monitoring system, for a distribution transformer. The main objective of this project is to develop mobile embedded system will help the utilities to optimally utilize the protection of power line of transformer and identify problems before any catastrophic failure.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as billions of devices and wirelessly connected systems will soon be adopting various IoT technologies and exchanging potentially sensitive information. IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities. Therefore, rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving environment. This paper presents different risks and security threats to the IoT, some security measures and solution models as well as a vulnerability assessment approach for the IoT in the healthcare sector.},

abstract={Research trends in Internet of Things (IoT) in health care show its potential to improve quality of health care. It helps to enable preventive care and promote automation to reduce the risk of human error. In Indonesia, mother and child health care is still an important agenda of the government because the maternal and child mortality rate is still high. This paper describes a preliminary design of IoT applications for supporting mother and child healthcare program. We reviewed government regulations and guidelines to determine the needs and used them as a starting point. Then we defined the networks (topology, architectures, and platform), service and application, security and technology used in the design. This multi-platform system design constitutes portable medical devices with multiple sensors for collecting medical data and sending them to server. A mobile application works as mobile gateway for the devices and as a portal for accessing context-aware personalized information related to patient's condition. It also works as communication tool for teleconsultation. All of these functionalities are supported by service applications in a cloud so that patients and caregivers can access them from anywhere at anytime. This system is designed to enable remote monitoring and early detection by medical specialist and physicians at the clinic for mother and child preventive care.},

System analysis is given about: Big Data market in Health Care, ways of Medical Information Systems development, and the direction of hospitals transition to new condition based on three “whales” (hybrid Cloud computing, supercomputer and data center). The Internet of Things ecosystem foregrounds some important aspects related to gerontology, genetics, biorhythmology, and gravitational biology. Sociological understanding of people's role in formation of the new high IT dependence reality allows to determine the main vectors of farsighted forecast. The technological evolution can be described as subsequent stages: distribution of IT — automation — Digital transformation and Internet of Things — Big Data analytics — Artificial Intelligence solutions — people connection to Augmented Reality — Context-as-A-Service — NBIC- and GRAIN-technologies — Humanity Plus. The essence of concept “patient” is changing. Patient transforms into an e-patient (all records about patient have been digitized) and then into Internet-patient with monitoring of health parameters within the Internet of Things surrounding people. Getting Augmented Reality patient is becoming a Digital patient. Augmented Reality methods are already being developed to treat patients.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.},

Smart health care can be implemented at all levels, starting from temperature monitoring for babies to tracking vital signs in the elderly. The complexity and cost of implementation varies based on the required precision of the individual device, functionalities, and sophistication of the application for which they are used. Smart health care also falls under vertical areas such as very-large-scale integration, embedded system, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},

However, with the adoption of IoT, new challenges arise, such as the design of architectures able to support the requirements of the new applications. Towards this goal, we explore a three layered architecture, able to acquire, process and store Healthcare data as well as to provide real-time decision making. We use ECG signal arrhythmia detection as our use case evaluation scenario, and compare different techniques for wireless communication, storage and data classification. Experimental results show that, our architecture provides real-time decision making, with an average delay of 15 μs and that different communication technologies achieved to provide up to 10% lower power consumption on the monitoring devices. 1},

abstract={Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology, which appears tantalizing in the healthcare domain. Governments encourage smart city initiatives to explore its applications. To determine knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare institutions toward IoT applications it is very important to objectively understand effects, to systematically summarize experiences, risks and barriers, to suggest market- oriented requirements, and to provide inspiration and reference for future smart city initiatives. Methods: We designed a KAP questionnaire about the IoT for healthcare and conducted a survey among municipal hospitals in Wuxi, China in May, 2015. Results: All respondents agreed on the definition of IoT for healthcare and easily obtained knowledge about the new IoT technology. Respondents showed positive views towards valuable functions and preferred solutions with inventory or material tracking, identification and authentication to make healthcare services more effective, convenient, and safe.

For every one minute a death swoops in because of heart attack. To save a life is auspicious as well as precious. The idea here is to provide an intelligent smart health system using some sensors and microcontrollers; it will sense the body condition and send the data to the collaborated hospital's website. If the condition is critical, an ambulance is allotted to that particular location where the patient lives. To reach the destination on time the driver will use google map with the help of the website and to avoid accident, obstacles, integrated hardware is made using by Arduino and sensors.},

Even thougha variety of models and frameworks which describe factors associated with the eHealth literacy and online health information seeking behavior are available, it is very rare to have a framework which elucidates the role of social capital in health communication inequalities. Hence, the intent of this study is to develop a framework to explore socio-demographic, social determinants, and social networks' influences on eHealth literacy and online health information seeking among adults. To develop the conceptual framework, the authors reviewed the existing literature on health literacy with the support of Structural Influence Model of Health Communication (SIMHC).

abstract={Healthcare Internet of things (IoT) has been proposed as a promising means to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and access by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while prevent unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system which supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly developing field and has the potential to significantly impact the healthcare industry. However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.},

abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback. This data, which pertains to bicortical drilling conditions, will provide teaching surgeons and their surgical residents evaluation tools beyond those currently available.},

abstract={Advances in information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). In the healthcare environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to physicians and patients as they can be applied to various medical areas (such as constant real-time monitoring, patient information management, medical emergency management, blood information management, and health management). The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment. In this paper, we discuss the security requirements of RFID authentication schemes, and in particular, we present a review of ECC-based RFID authentication schemes in terms of performance and security. Although most of them cannot satisfy all security requirements and have satisfactory performance, we found that there are three recently proposed ECC-based authentication schemes suitable for the healthcare environment in terms of their performance and security.},

abstract={Many Technology experts consider Internet of things as major step for the future endeavors that are going to happen in computer network field. According to CISCO, IoT can be considered as a situation or time where more things are connected to internet than human beings. Things represent the physical objects which are provided with unique identification numbers and their purpose is to collect and transmit the data which are relevant to the scenario in which things are placed. From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification. In RFID system, proper authentication has to be performed between RFID tags and RFID reader. In this paper describes a authentication scheme which performs authentication between RFID tag and RFID reader with help of a server which contains some pre shared information about tag and reader.},

We proposes a mobile phone-based internet of things method for human action recognition. In the work, data are collected from a smart phone worn on the waist and transmitted to the application server on the internet. The application server program cuts these data into segments of 128 samples with 50% overlap. And each segment is embedded into a 6-dimensional pseudo phase space, then a geometric template matching algorithm is applied to classify them into different actions. Last, Bayesian principle and voting rule are combined to confuse the results of the k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Experimental results on UCI HAR datasets show that this method can obtain a significant improvement in accuracy compared with the traditional SVM methods.},

abstract={We begin to co-exist and interact with smart interconnected devices that are known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT brings new opportunities for our society. Yet, most of the existing Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems are not connected to the IoT. SHM is a system to monitor the structural health of buildings and bridges. In this paper, a complete real-time SHM platform is integrated with the IoT system. The proposed platform consists of a Pro-Trinket microcontroller, NRF transceiver module, Wi-Fi module, and Raspberry Pi. Two piezoelectric sensors are mounted on the structure to collect data continually. A proposed mathematical model is implemented on the Pro-Trinket to detect the health of the structure using the piezoelectric sensors output. If there is any damage, the Pro-Trinket will determine the damage location and size, and send this information to the Raspberry Pi using NRF transceiver. Raspberry Pi acts as a hub to collect the data from many such NRF transceivers located in different locations on the structure. The Raspberry Pi will upload the data to the cloud using a Wi-Fi module. The data will be stored in the cloud and can be checked remotely from any mobile device. The system has been validated using a real test bed in the lab.},

abstract={In an environment that is only now addressing the security issues of medical devices as a constituent part of IT networks, a new wave of technological development is threatening to swamp healthcare. The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery. Making security the enabler of safe and protected data transfer, exchange, and use, is fundamental to using this technology.},

This has prompted active research in the development of solutions that enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor and evaluate the health of patients in the comfort of their residences. However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.},

abstract={Internet of Things is a new generation of network service platform that allows everyday objects including small devices in sensor networks to be capable of connecting to the internet. Such an innovative technology can lead to positive changes in human life. An e-health service based on the Internet of Things has great potential. The popularity of intelligent mobile medical devices, wearable bio-medical sensor devices, cloud computing, and big data analysis have dramatically changed the usage pattern and business rule of e-health services based on the Internet of Things. The rapid development of e-health services based on the Internet of Things poses risks in security and privacy. In this study, we propose a new security scheme for an e-health service. This scheme allows both the local base station and hospital cloud server to authenticate each other, to secure the collection of health data. Our scheme uses the crypto hash function to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides mutual authentication with anonymity and terminates with a session key agreement between each local base station and the hospital cloud server. To assess our scheme, we conduct performance and security analysis. Results show that our scheme is secure, lightweight, and resistant to different types of attacks.},

abstract={Connected data has always been considered as a primary source to knowledge. Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable. Rather it adds to the foundation notion of ubiquitous services by making available to everyone and everywhere.

abstract={By incorporating sensing capabilities in passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging technology it is possible to extend the coverage of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to monitor the health of different segments of a large civil infrastructure like pavement highway, buildings or a multi-span bridge. The challenge in this regard is to deliver energy to the RFID sensors that are embedded inside the structures in a manner that they can continuously sense for occurrence of any rare structural events. This paper summarizes some of the progress that has been made to-date in the area of self-powered RFID sensor networks within the concept of IoT. The core sensor uses a self-powering method which directly harvests computational and storage energy from slight strain-variations in the structure. The event signatures can then be stored on a non-volatile memory and remotely retrieved at a later period of time. In this “sense now retrieve later” paradigm, self-powering is only used for continuous sensing and data-logging of essential statistics; whereas, data retrieval and reconfiguration is achieved using a low-cost commercial RFID system. Another advantage of using a commercial RFID system for data retrieval is that the related standards and FCC compliance are well established and the technology can be easily integrated with other IoT network infrastructure.},

abstract={Prediction of Chronic Disorders in early stage is very vital. IoT facilitated remote health monitoring system has enormous benefits over customary health monitoring system. It is imperative to accumulate correct raw data in an efficient way; but more significant is to explore and mine the raw data to abstract more valued information such as correlations amongst things and services to afford web of things or Internet of services. In this Paper we have addressed the use of IoT in Healthcare system, challenges of IoT in Healthcare System and review on various works carried out on this research area with which a proposed methodology is been discussed.},

abstract={We describe the initial process of eliciting requirements for an Internet-of-things (IoT) application involving a hospital emergency room. First, we discuss the process of modeling IoT systems through rich pictures and use cases. Then, we demonstrate how these can be used to model emergency room systems. Then, we create use case models for a particular situation—a patient potentially suffering from a myocardial infarction. Finally, we discuss generalization of the specific case to a broader hospital wide system. We believe that such an approach can lead to increased efficiency, increased safety, and better tracking of people, equipment, and supplies.},

abstract={The recent advancements in technology and the availability of the Internet make it possible to connect various devices that can communicate with each other and share data. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows users to connect various sensors and smart devices to collect real-time data from the environment. However, it has been observed that a comprehensive platform is still missing in the e-Health and m-Health architectures to use smartphone sensors to sense and transmit important data related to a patient's health. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we critically evaluate the existing literature, which discusses the effective ways to deploy IoT in the field of medical and smart health care. Secondly, we propose a new semantic model for patients' e-Health. The proposed model named as `k-Healthcare' makes use of 4 layers; the sensor layer, the network layer, the Internet layer and the services layer. All layers cooperate with each other effectively and efficiently to provide a platform for accessing patients' health data using smart phones.},

abstract={Obesity is one of the most serious and dangerous nutrition disorder around the world. Usually, people develop patterns of unhealthy eating that lead to increased body weight and accumulation of fat in the body. There are many reasons for that as suggested by researchers; one of the reasons is the imbalance between the energy intake from food and energy consumed in the body, which can possibly lead to increased body weight. One of the primary treatments for this serious health risk include diets, physical activity, weight-loss training and adoption of health programs that promote healthy eating. As such, reliable mechanism to prevent and control the obesity levels is vital. It led many experts and researchers who are interested in the health sector to explore more solutions that help to combat the obesity phenomenon. This paper presents a mobile health application intended to increase the awareness levels of parents and children about the obesity risks and help them to sustain balanced and healthy eating lifestyle. The proposed mobile application is an educational tool for the evaluation of interventions to prevent obesity risk levels. The application is based on the Internet-of-Things approach, which allows tracking food intake, remote capturing and constant monitoring of children data with interactive feedback displayed on the mobile application.},

abstract={Recent evolution of IoT (Internet of Things) hubs plays a key role in connected health solutions. IoT hubs can connect health devices and smart appliances and provide new data sources for health management. All home appliances are getting smarter with loT of processing capabilities added. In the current evolution of IoT devices only wearable devices and medical devices are being classified as health relevant devices. This paper attempts to classify smart appliances such as micro oven as health devices and explains the importance of data from this set of devices for monitoring user health goals. Fully distributed health systems operate in a peer-to-peer manner, where they both store and manage health information locally on each device. These systems do not contain any single point of failure and are thus more resilient. This paper addresses method to classify non health devices with health data (Ex Micro oven, Coffee machine, smart TV). Also how real time monitoring of user health goals on smart appliances. Also how devices can collaborate for helping user achieve his goals is covered in this paper.},

abstract={The strong development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is changing traditional perceptions of the current Internet towards a vision of smart objects interacting with each other. In this vision e-health applications are one of the most promising applications in IoT. However, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality constitutes the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme for an e-health application. This scheme allows both of sensors and the Base Station (BS) to authenticate each other in order to secure the collection of health-related data. Our scheme uses nonces and Keyed-Hash message authentication (HMAC) to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides authentication with less energy consumption, and it terminates with a session key agreement between each sensor and the Base Station. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that our scheme saves energy. In addition, it is resistant against different types of attacks.},

abstract={Mobile Health (mHealth) is now emerging with Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud and big data along with the prevalence of smart wearable devices and sensors. There is also the emergence of smart environments such as smart homes, cars, highways, cities, factories and grids. Presently, it is difficult to quickly forecast or prevent urgent health situations in real-time as health data are analyzed offline by a physician. Sensors are expected to be overloaded by demands of providing health data from IoT networks and smart environments. This paper proposes to resolve the problems by introducing an inference system so that life-threatening situations can be prevented in advance based on a short and long term health status prediction. This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud. The inference system can also resolve the problem of data overload in sensor nodes by reducing data volume and frequency to reduce workload in sensor nodes. This paper presents a novel idea of tracking down and predicting a personal health status as well as intelligent functionality of inference in sensor nodes to interface IoT networks.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={581-588},
abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},

abstract={Internet of Things technology provides a competent and structured approach to improve health and wellbeing of mankind. One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism. Our experimental results reveal that fog computing helps achieving more than 90% bandwidth efficiency and offering low-latency real time response at the edge of the network.},

abstract={The current trend of population growth demands a more flexible and readily available healthcare services compared to traditional centralized approach. Mobile and wearable devices that have sensing and Internet access capabilities offer the opportunity of changing how medical services are delivered to the patients. The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology. The protocol stacks of the edge router and router are validated through successful connectivity tests and packet drop tests. The single-hop communication latency is also measured to give an indication of the overheads introduced by the stack.},

In particular, wearable biosensing accelerates human-centered computing for smart health management. However, limited work has been done to develop advanced IoT technologies for smart monitoring and control of heart health. There is an urgent need to develop a new IoT technology specific to the heart, namely Internet of Hearts (IOH) that will enable and assist (1) the acquisition of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals pertinent to space-time cardiac dynamics at anytime anywhere; (2) real-time management and compact representation of multi-sensor signals; (3) big data analytics in large-scale IoT contexts. This paper presents a new technology of Mobile and E-Network Smart Health (MESH), which is composed of 4 components as follows: 1) Mobile-based ECG sensing device; 2) Space-time representation of cardiac electrical activity; 3) Optimal model-based representation of ECG signals; 4) Dynamic network embedding for disease pattern recognition. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrated that network analytics is efficient and effective for smart health management in IoT contexts. The MESH technology shows strong potentials to provide an indispensable and enabling tool for realizing smart heart health and wellbeing for the population worldwide.},

abstract={The Things in the smart Internet of Things (IoT) depend more on self decision making abilities instead of relying on human interventions. In the IoT, static security mechanisms are not well suited to handle all security risks sufficiently. A security mechanism can be considered static if it is developed with fixed security measures whereas an adaptive security mechanism can be considered dynamic if it can continuously monitor, analyse, and reassess a security risk at runtime. Adaptive security mechanisms can be a better choice to secure dynamic and heterogeneous computing systems in the IoT. This paper presents a patient monitoring scenario using the smart IoT and aims at highlighting all important assets, vulnerabilities, and threats that can harm assets and disrupt eHealth systems. We describe adaptive security and introduce a concept of adaptive security countermeasures for the smart IoT in eHealth.},

abstract={Prognostics and health management is a method within the concepts of the Internet of Things, that permits the assessment of a system under its actual application conditions. It integrates sensor data with models that enable in-situ assessment of the “health” (e.g. deviation or degradation) of a system from an expected normal operating condition and also predicts the future state of the system based on current and historic conditions. This presentation discusses some methods used for anomaly detection and prognostics, including the monitoring and reasoning of parameters that are precursors to impending “failure”, such as shifts in performance parameters; and the modeling of stress and damage utilizing life cycle loads (e.g., usage, temperature, vibration, radiation). Examples of implementation methods and results are given.},

To bridge the gap between research approaches in the area of both Health-IoT and content centric networking, this paper presents the first content centric networking test bed framework called PHI Net for experimentation with Health-IoT. PHI Net aims to fulfill the following goals: ease of use, seamless scaling, support for testing, development and integration of health services and sensors, support for experimentation with live traffic underneath, and integration of the cloud into Health-IoT. Architecture, design, and implementation of PHI Net is presented. Furthermore, through several use cases, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed work.},

abstract={Among the panoply of applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart and connected health care is a particularly important one. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environments, make possible the gathering of rich information indicative of our physical and mental health. Captured on a continual basis, aggregated, and effectively mined, such information can bring about a positive transformative change in the health care landscape. In particular, the availability of data at hitherto unimagined scales and temporal longitudes coupled with a new generation of intelligent processing algorithms can: (a) facilitate an evolution in the practice of medicine, from the current post facto diagnose-and-treat reactive paradigm, to a proactive framework for prognosis of diseases at an incipient stage, coupled with prevention, cure, and overall management of health instead of disease, (b) enable personalization of treatment and management options targeted particularly to the specific circumstances and needs of the individual, and (c) help reduce the cost of health care while simultaneously improving outcomes. In this paper, we highlight the opportunities and challenges for IoT in realizing this vision of the future of health care.},

abstract={Health is the fundamental capability humans require to perceive, feel, and act effectively, and as such, it represents a primary element in the development of the individual, but also of the environment humans belongs to. That is why it is necessary to provide adequate ways and means to ensure the appropriate healthcare delivery based on parameters monitoring and direct providing of the medical assistance. The new technologies development and implementation, especially the Internet and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), enable global approach to the health care system infrastructure development. This leads to e-health system that, in real time manner, supplies a valuable set of information relevant to all of the stakeholders (patients, medical and paramedical stuff, and health insurance) regardless their current location. Commercial systems in this area usually do not meet the general patient needs, and those that do are usually economically unacceptable due to the high operational and development costs. In this paper, based on well-known low-cost technologies, there is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solution for a sustainable and adaptable patient oriented infrastructure development, presented.},

abstract={There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system energy efficiency, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.},

abstract={Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars, and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability. The prototype shown in this work uses the 6LoWPAN standard in a network environment that connects with a real Bridge Management System, with the aim of optimizing the maintenance of road structures.},

abstract={I-Health can be defined as “intelligent system and android, wireless communications technologies for health-care.” This emerging concept represents the evolution of I-Health systems from traditional desktop “telemedicine” platforms to wireless and mobile configurations. The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. This editorial paper presents a snapshot of recent developments in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the I-Health perspective. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these recent developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging concept.},

As the utilization cases are very numerous we questioned if the number of applications is similarly large. In order to run this study we start establishing a classification of the use-cases and populate it with main scenarios used in healthcare. We found that despite a reasonably large taxonomy, applications use a low number of solutions with variations and add-ons. The main use-case is by far Remote Patient Monitoring that can be found together with some variations in the large majority of the studied scenarios and this is the use-case detailed below. The overall landscape is covered in a PhD thesis that approaches additional Internet-of-Things usage and benefits in healthcare.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) has provided a promising choice for structural health monitoring (SHM) recently. In vibration-based structural health monitoring, structural features which are extracted from periodically spaced measurement using sensors are subject to variable environmental conditions. This paper proposes an environmental effect removal based structural health monitoring scheme in an IoT environment. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to eliminate environment effects from sensor data which contain both real vibration feature of architectural structure and environmental interferences. After environmental effects removal, Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) which is a classical method for signal analysis is used for structural health analysis and monitoring. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy in structural health monitoring and robust performance against environmental interferences.},

abstract={Communication and information access defines the basis to reach a personalized health end-to-end framework. Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem. This evaluates for the proposed protocol the data aggregation mechanism level, Round-Trip delay Time, impact of the distance, and the impact of the security. It has been concluded that secure continuous monitoring is feasible with the use of the proposed {YOAPY}} aggregation mechanisms and the capabilities from the proposed interconnection framework.},

abstract={In-home healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have big potential in business. To exploit this opportunity, an ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should aim for a cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform-based in-home healthcare station is proposed. The proposed methodology and solution are demonstrated in implemented prototype system and field trials.},

In response to this, we presents a distributed communication solution for mHealth applications which circumvents these limitations. Our Internet-of-Things architecture enables mHealth applications to utilize information from sensors and wireless sensor networks via a peer-to-peer overlay, where sensor information is organized in an information model which is stored in the overlay itself. We present a proof-of-concept application and evaluation results regarding the architecture's real-time capabilities.

title={IoT-based Remote Pain Monitoring System: from Device to Cloud Platform},
year={2017},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={Facial expressions are among behavioral signs of pain that can be employed as an entry point to develop an automatic human pain assessment tool. Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the Intensive Care Unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a bio-sensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real-time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system act as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application. In summary, this study proposes a scalable IoT system for real-time biopotential monitoring and a wearable solution for automatic pain assessment via facial expressions.},

abstract={We present here new types of self-powered, low-interference wireless sensors based on graphene circuits, which can have dual functions: chemical sensing at the molecular level and radio-frequency (RF) modulation. We demonstrate that a fully passive, graphene-based harmonic (transponder) sensor can display a chemically sensitive frequency multiplication effect, which, when linked to a hybrid-fed small antenna, can realize an ultrasensitive, low-profile, light-weight, and potentially flexible RF sensor. We have designed two different types of circuits comprising back-gate graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and compared in detail their performance and implementation complexity. We have also proposed a reliable readout method based on the machine learning for extracting the mean value and the fluctuation of chemical doping levels in GFETs. The proposed graphene-based harmonic sensor may potentially benefit a wide range of sensing applications, including, but not limited to, power-efficient, real-time monitoring of chemical/gas exposures and biological agents, as well as emerging wearable and implantable devices.},

abstract={With the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of IoT devices and sensors is increasing tremendously. This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility.},

abstract={With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose a- innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting. The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.},

The presented IoT application system is implemented on the basis of an eight channel biopotential measurement device, Wi-Fi module as well as signal processing and classification provided as a Cloud service. In the system, the real-time sEMG data stream is filtered, feature extracted and classified within each data segment and the processed data is visualized in a browser remotely together with the classification result.},

pages={290-296},
abstract={MQTT-SN offers energy efficient data transportation under unreliable wireless environment with limited energy/ bandwidth. However, MQTT-SN faces a new set of challenges for service guarantees when operated for a reliable or time-critical applications. The impact of various network parameters on the MQTT-SN service assurance requires an end-to-end system study, which are unexplored yet. In this paper we analyze in detail about the end-to-end service assurance parameters such as content delivery delay and probability of content delivery for a MQTT-SN to be used in health care Internet of Things (IoT). To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals. Both these service assurance parameters will give more insight into the number of content/request arrivals that can be supported for a given service assurance requirement. In addition these service assurance parameters will be of help to design the system more effectively. We carry out a detailed ns2 based simulation to show impacts of various system parameters on the network performances for various QoS services designed for MQTT-SN system.},

abstract={In recent years, the research in generic Internet of Things (IoT) attracts a lot of practical applications including smart home, smart city, smart grid, industrial Internet, connected healthcare, smart retail, smart supply chain and smart farming. The hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN) is a special kind of the generic IoT network, which is composed of the different nodes, such as the gateway node, cluster head nodes, and sensing nodes organized in a hierarchy. In HIoTN, there is a need, where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password, and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely accepted real-or-random model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool.

abstract={In today's world, Internet of Things (IoT) is a different development. With the help of IoT, all the physical objects can connect to the internet. And with this we can consider the two layers of the system viz: the sensor device which gathers data and links to cloud and next is the cloud service which hosts the information from th e en vironmen t. In th e storage rooms of industries we need a good environment for the products to be healthy for use. Here we develop a monitoring system with the help of IoT. The Internet of Things entrance is used as a part of this system. In this strategy we use several access methods such as Wi­Fi, GPRS, Ethernet etc. and also the data collected can be stored. In this IOT gateway we use ATmega 328 as the Microcontroller unit and pC/OS-III as the implanted OS. The application authenticates that the entrance is reliable. In this paper we try to develop an arrangement encompassing Arduino wireless sensor networks and cloud and then extend our work to develop a method for the transmission of data between them which can be of great use in monitoring the temperature and humidity. With the help of this monitoring system, the real time detection of the temperature and humidity of the storage rooms can be improved and the longevity of the products can be ensured.},

Data integrity in healthcare is of utmost importance. A compromised transmitted or received signal can pose serious health hazards to patients. With the growing number of devices connected to the Internet, serious security concerns have been raised in relation to lack of appropriate security mechanisms used in Internet of Things devices. While security considerations are not recent in the arena of Information Technology, many existing frameworks developed for Internet of Things (IoT)healthcare present new and unique security challenges. In order to address these challenges and ensure a maximum level of security in IoT products and services, a lightweight and reliable framework has been developed which uses a combination of universally unique identifier, timestamp and a self-learning battery depletion monitor to detect and mitigate replay attacks on battery dependent IoT devices. A prototype application has been developed to successfully test the framework.},

abstract={Wireless body area networks (WBANs), as an important part of the Internet of things and sensor networks, are becoming more important in health monitoring and entertainment services. The sensor nodes in these applications need to transmit information data to personal station and receive control information from personal station to adjust working modes. However, unlike an easily rechargeable personal station, body sensor nodes suffer from energy shortages, which affect the nodes lifetimes. To solve this problem, we design a novel medium access control (MAC) layer protocol to enhance the energy efficiency and extend the lifetime of body sensor nodes in WBANs. The proposed protocol utilizes a hybrid scheme by taking advantage of carrier-sense multiple accesses with the collision avoidance and time division multiple access schemes. In addition, we allocate the main transmission overhead at the personal station side and design a novel awaiting order state for sensor nodes to improve energy efficiency. Also, the analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol can provide a 6 to 15 decrease in energy consumption from other protocols.},

abstract={Analysis of foot plantar pressure distribution is an important factor considered today in the field of healthcare as well as in sports world. Lower body physical rehabilitation therapies are associated with sports world. To avoid long-term damage to the affected part and to accelerate the recovery period, it is necessary to keep an eye on the patient regularly following his/her rehabilitation activities not only in the hospital but also at home. Multiple techniques have been developed for quantitative gait analysis but comparatively these systematic process fails as it measures static or dynamic process for very short duration of time and space. In the proposed system, an electronic insole system is designed in a shoe using force sensing resistor (FSR) sensor that monitors pressure wirelessly, thus saving the information in an array of sensor network for transferring data into CPU. Thus considering the information available used for further study purpose. Four sensors are placed, one at the heel, one at the lateral part, one at the metatarsal head and one at the anterior. The plantar pressure is used to analyse pressure distribution. The signal from the pressure sensor will be processed by microcontroller and sent to mobile via Bluetooth module. With the help of Internet-of-Things (IoT), when the signal goes beyond the limit the notification will be sent to patient consulting the doctors/physiotherapist so that immediate action can be carried out further. The proposed system will help the doctors/physiotherapist as well as person to monitor his health using smart shoe.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a competent and structured approach to handle service deliverance aspects of healthcare in terms of mobile health and remote patient monitoring. IoT generates an unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud computing. But for real-time remote health monitoring applications, the delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient’s real-time data at Fog Layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index (THI) of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed BBN classifier based model has high accuracy and response time in determining the state of an event when compared with other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

abstract={The Internet of things (IoT) is revolutionizing the management and control of automated systems leading to a paradigm shift in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, health care, transportation, etc. The IoT technology is also envisioned to play an important role in improving the effectiveness of military operations in battlefields. The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, heterogeneity of devices, and susceptibility to cyber-physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and information dissemination in the presence of adversaries. This work aims to build the theoretical foundations of designing secure and reconfigurable IoBT networks. Leveraging the theories of stochastic geometry and mathematical epidemiology, we develop an integrated framework to quantify the information dissemination among heterogeneous network devices. Consequently, a tractable optimization problem is formulated that can assist commanders in cost effectively planning the network and reconfiguring it according to the changing mission requirements.},

abstract={Diagnosis, and monitoring of health is a very important task in healthcare industry. Due to time constraint, people are not visiting hospitals, which might and possibly lead to a lot of health issues in one instant of time. Predominantly most of the healthcare systems have been developed to predict and diagnose the health of the patients by which people who are busy in their schedule can also monitor their health at regular intervals. Many studies show that early prediction is the best way to cure health because early diagnosis will help and alert the patients to know the health status. Healthcare being a global issue more particularly India being a most populated nation where majority of which live in villages deprived of healthcare facilities on real time basis continuously and regularly. With the increasing use of technology, there is an urgent need to have such a smart health monitoring system that can communicate between network devices and application which will help the patients and doctors to monitor, track and record the patient's sensitive data containing medical information. This paper depicts the idea of solving health issues using the latest technology, Internet of Things (IoT). It presents the architectural review of smart healthcare system using Internet of Things(IoT) which is aimed to provide a Better HealthCare to everyone. Using this system architecture, patient's body parameters can be measured in real time.

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) becomes a novel paradigm as more and more devices are connected to the Internet, enabling several innovative applications such as smart home, industrial automation, and connected health. However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents’ behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries’ machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home’s traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multi-hop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user’s personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.},

abstract={Smart city has various annotations such as intelligent city, clean city, digital city, green city and many more. This conceptual paper aims at developing a portal for solid waste processing unit which needs the classified information regarding solid waste and the portal also enables the waste processing unit to collaborate with other satellite units and waste collectors for efficient and faster actions. The classification is done by algorithmic approach in our paper and the entity of trash is digitally tractable. This classified trash information can be further used by recycling waste processing units, waste disposing units etc. to get notified on time and clear the waste from waste processing units. The solid wastes can be broadly categorized into dry, wet and hazardous. Further actions that could be done to make city a clean and smart city is to determine whether the wastes are recyclable, reusable or only disposable by subsequent processing units. In today's context, almost everything can be digitally coded and tracked with emerging technologies like Internet of Things. For a fast developing country and second largely populated country like India, smart and healthy urban living is a significant demand. In our paper, we have put forth ideas for making big data into actionable insights using technologies and facilitate collaboration by means of a portal.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) totally transformed our world on many levels and in many fields either industry, health, economy, energy saving, etc. According to Cisco by 2020 there will about 50 billion IoT connected devices and this causes many issues specially security problems. IoT devices are widely used everywhere and leads to user privacy, big data as well as in data and server management problems but malware is from the biggest challenges facing IoT devices where there are different types of malware like viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spy-ware and viruses, which can access and manipulate confidential information or cause a running problem in the system. As there are many types of malware but at the same time there are different approaches for malware analysis. Therefore there are many approaches to handle malware analysis and each approach has its pros and cons. In this paper we will discuss security issues in IoT devices and different approaches for malware analysis and build a taxonomy for malware analysis tools and methodologies from different points of view as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.},

abstract={As a new research area, Digital Forensics is a subject in a rapidly developing society. Cyber Security for Big Data in the Cloud is getting more attention than ever. A computing breach requires digital forensics to seize digital evidence to determine who is responsible and what has been done maliciously and the possible further consequences. In particular, for Big Data attack cases, Digital Forensics is facing even more challenge for earlier digital breach investigations. For the PPI (Protection of Personal Information) a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law has been launched to be implemented from the 25th May 2018. This compulsory regulation will have an important impact on healthcare PPI in the cloud (ICO, 2017, Deloitte, 2014). Nowadays, Big Data with the characteristics of three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and Variety), are either synchronized with the Cloud, or stored in the Cloud, in order to solve the storage capacity and so on problems, which made Digital Forensics investigation even more difficult. The Big Data Digital Forensics issue for the Cloud is difficult. One of them is the need to identify which physical devices have been compromised. Data are distributed in the Cloud, so the customer or digital forensics practitioner cannot have full access control like the traditional investigation does. Smart City are making use of ICT (information communications technology) to collect, detect, analyze and integrate the key information data of core systems in running the cities. Meanwhile, the Control Centre is making intelligent responses to different requirements that include daily livelihood, PPI security, environmental protection, public safety, industrial and commercial activities and city services. The Smart City healthcare Big Data are collected and gathered by the IoT (Internet of Things) (Liu, 2014, Qi, 2016) and applying GDPR prevent Cyberstalking and Cybercrimes. This paper summerises our review on the trend- of Digital Forensics used for Big Data. The evidence acquisition challenge is discussed. A case study of a Smart City project with IoT services collecting Big Data which are stored in the Cloud computing environment is represented. The techniques can be generalised to other Big Data in the Cloud environment.},

abstract={Devices used in Internet of Things (IoT) technology are interconnected through internet and continuously send data for storage in disparate databases and files. This poses heterogeneity in data syntax and semantics. In the past few years, researches have been carried out to handle these problems in various information systems such as water and healthcare by applying semantic and syntactic uniformity. This research presents an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework to sustain the interoperability between stakeholders within an information system by applying Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) paradigm and ontology. The major contribution of this research is building software model which is annotated with semantic model to maintain the comprehension between the modelers and the programmers allowing sustainability by adapting to the changing environment. Moreover, the framework offers two types of semantic validation i.e. model and data of the documents to integrate sensor data which we claim as a novelty in this study. The validated IoT data is integrated through RESTful web service interface of SensorThings API. The aim of this paper is to apply the methodology of the framework, on IoT based healthcare system, that has been successful in water information system.},

Such system will provide ubiquitous capabilities to various applications, including manufacturing transportation and health care. The aim of this paper is to provide real-time context-aware healthcare services to elderly patients. The proposed solution is context-aware by identifying health condition and tracking patients in a real-time manner. It can extract this context information from wearable sensors and iBeacons, and by employing ontological based semantic meaning appropriate action can also be taken. In critical medical conditions the system can send alert notifications to nearest rescue medics or emergency centers including patient location. The system utilizes the iBeacons that are more simple, accurate, low-cost and energy efficient than existing technologies. The system is actually ontology base engine, which gets the information through sensors, identify the symptoms and classify them into normal and critical categories using naive Bayes classifier.

abstract={All natural resources in our beautiful world becoming extinct. In the similar way, the energy resources such as gasoline used by human being for day to day activities are endangered. In the near future we will definitely lack in all kinds of resources. Several countries are slowly changing their dependence towards renewable resources, the gift from our mother nature. As consumption of fuel resources paved a way for polluted surrounding, even the newborns are greatly prone to lung infections. Thus World Health Organization is now creating awareness via NGO'S about the use of solar and wind energy for our survival to enjoy a pollution free nation. Though renewable resources are at free of cost, they should also be monitored and controlled. This paper proposes a system which is used to monitor the solar energy consumed by the home appliances. In this system the home appliances are fixed with current sensor for television, heavy load appliances and current sensor and temperature sensor for refrigerator. The ideals from these sensors are fed into the microcontroller with data acquisition system and then are transmitted via Bluetooth technology to the mobile application. Using mobile application, the user can overseer the consumption units of each home appliance and if the consumption crosses a threshold limit, the user can cut off the supply of the appliances via distant host using Internet of Things.},

The primary motivation behind this innovation is to decrease the work load at doctor's facilities and give proficient medical services. For this purpose, different body sensors are used to monitor the physical parameters such as electro-cardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature of patients, and use wireless sensor network (WSN) in conjunction with internet of things (IoT) to continuously monitor the patient condition.

IoT allows the information collected by smart devices to be transmitted to the people across the globe through Internet and enhancing people's lives in many aspects, such as health, energy, transportation, etc. In IoT, the communication between device-to-device or device-to-people very often go through different domains each having separate trust authority. Therefore, maintaining trust in the federated network of IoT is really important. However, IoT is vulnerable to numerous threats like tampering of information and key distribution issue, while considering the constraint in its resource. This paper proposes a method to secure communication that manages trust of IoT in federated fashion while minimizing usage of resources in IoT devices. Other aspects of loosely/tightly coupled network federation, dynamic nature of IoT devices in the network and the security analysis will also be discussed in the paper.},

abstract={High concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has negative impacts on the environment and adversely affects the health of the public. In the Philippines, the transport sector specifically public utility vehicles (PUVs) dominantly contribute to the overall CO2 emission (CO2e) due to its engines' low efficiency. Moreover, the road grade and driving behavior such as the speed, and acceleration among these vehicles significantly affect the variability of its contribution to the overall CO2e. Thus, an Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system using onboard facilitative mobile sensor networks was installed in PUVs for wireless data collection to quantify the said variability of emission given some of its indicative variables. The collected data resulted in the difference in CO2e at around 33% between uphill roads and downhill roads, 16% to 27 % between downhill and flat roads, and 10% to 20% between flat and uphill roads. Moreover, the speeds around 40 km/h to 50 km/h have emitted lowest CO2 when compared to slower speeds. With this, CO2e of PUVs has clearly affected with the road grades and driving patterns. The result may be used as a reference for in-depth characterization in reducing CO2e in the Philippine transportation sector.},

In this paper, a signal processing based SHM is proposed where a simple Butterworth filter was used to remove noises. Cross-Correlation was used for damage detection. If there was any damage found, using a mathematical model, damage size and location were determined. After analyzing the experimental data, error found in damage localization is 2.9% and error in determining damage size is 3.344%. Since the whole algorithm does not associate with complex mathematical calculations, this system can be used for low-cost distributed system for SHM.},

abstract={With the evolution and development of the 5th generation (5G) technology, Internet of Things (IoT) within 5G provides a foundation and opportunity for smart home and smart healthcare. However, these scenarios will critically rely on the large-scale deployed sensors that constantly transmit streaming data to cloud platform for real-time estimation, which brings the issue of privacy disclosure since smart devices will gather kinds of data including personal sensitive information. Meanwhile, there is not some universal method to solve privacy problem in 5G because of diversified security needs for different applications. In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter based differentially private steaming data share scheme is proposed to protect user privacy for cloud platform in IoT. The proposed method can ensure that released data will not compromise individual privacy, and improve the utility of released data simultaneously. The proposed scheme is evaluated by four real-world datasets and compared with the results of utility optimization scheme based on Kalman filter. Experiments show that the proposed scheme enhances the utility of released streaming data under the premise of effective privacy preserving and achieve better practicability and validity.},

abstract={Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the us- rs and the system, are demonstrated.},

abstract={Smart Healthcare is envisioned as the combination of traditional healthcare augmented by smart bio-sensors, wearable devices and a plethora of on-body sensors that communicate with smart hospitals, smart emergency response systems, and ambulances, through advanced information and communication technologies. The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. The present paper address some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a Secure Digital Camera (SDC) integrated with the Secure Better Portable Graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this work is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection: concurrent encryption and watermarking which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management (DRM). The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: (1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image, and (2) frequency domain watermarking using block-wise DCT of size 8×8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant incre- se of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes.

abstract={In recent studies Machine Learning is regarded to be one of the disruptive technologies that will transform our future life, business and the global economy. In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs — and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation — are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed. This does not apply to computer science programs alone but also to other fields of study.},

abstract={Traditional medical privacy data is at serious risk of disclosure, and many related cases have occurred over the years. For example, personal medical privacy data can be easily leaked to insurance companies, which not only compromises the privacy of individuals, but also hinders the healthy development of the medical industry. With the continuous improvement of cloud computing and big data technologies, the Internet of Things technology has been rapidly developed. RFID is one of the core technologies of the Internet of things. The application of RFID system to the medical system can effectively solve this problem of medical privacy. RFID tags in the system can collect useful information and conduct data exchange and processing with back-end server through the reader. The whole process of information interaction is mainly in the form of cipher text. In the context of the Internet of Things, the article presents a lightweight RFID medical privacy protection scheme. The scheme ensures security privacy of the collected data via secure authentication. The security analysis and evaluation about the scheme indicate that the protocol can effectively prevent the risk of medical privacy data being easily leaked.},

abstract={Currently, precision dairy-monitoring technologies (PDMT) are gaining interest. These systems allow to monitor cow health, the time for insemination, and the birthing process. Doing so, they have the potential to reduce labor and management costs whilst increasing milk yield. Continuous innovations in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) have opened many new opportunities for monitoring animals and have been speeding up the development of PDMT systems. When designing an IoT-system, often various technological alternatives are available (e.g. communication technologies, types of sensors). Although this choice set can be narrowed down by mapping the functional and technical requirements on the technical specifications of the technologies, chances are that even after this step multiple alternatives are still feasible. In this work, we describe an IoT-system design methodology that also takes into account strategic and economic considerations. As a result, the choice set of feasible technologies can be limited to feasible alternatives that are also the most economic and strategic choices. In addition we describe how the total added value of such a PDMT can be quantified from the perspective of a dairy farmer. Applying this quantification methodology on the described PDMT system indicates an annual reduction of 250 EUR per cow for dairy management costs.},

abstract={Now a days, modeling and developing smart places is an open research problem. The concept of smart city can be observed in every field of life including smart parking, banking, sewerage, waste management, smart transport, environmental monitoring and healthcare centers. Internet of things (IoT) is an implementation of smart nodes that sense the data, interpret, process and give response within a required time in a network. The ability to embed sensing devices into real environment enables the transformation of smart environment. However, there is a very little practical use of IoT infrastructure in real life. Many traditional approaches are proposed by researchers that do not address this issue correctly. We have focused on the smart sewerage system of a smart city in this paper. The sewerage system is represented by a graph in which a junction is assumed as a node and flow of water is represented as a directed edge in the graph theory. The flow of water is controlled by defining a safe path from one junction to another by predicting behavior of water and safe state of the system. The graph based model is transformed into a formal model using Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL). The proof of correctness is provided by using various facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.},

pages={89-94},
abstract={In this paper, we present a novel design of an Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine based health monitoring system-The Smart Chair. Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities. The results presented show that the proposed system is definitely a low cost affordable solution for IoT based telemedicine system, as compared to existing systems.},

abstract={Emerging availability (and varying complexity and types) of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with large data volumes that such devices (can potentially) generate, can have a significant impact on our lives, fuelling the development of critical next-generation services and applications in a variety of application domains (e.g. healthcare, smart grids, finance, disaster management, agriculture, transportation and water management). Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. In other words, the focus of this Blue Skies piece is to analyze the research challenges involved with developing a new class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are “resource and data aware”, and which are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data and data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models and data availability while executing – trading accuracy for execution time, etc.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking and physical processes. Its process control is often referred to as embedded systems. Generally, CPS and Internet of Things (IoT) have the same basic architecture, whereas the former shows a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements, i.e., wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be a vital part of CPS applications. With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm to integrate the physical world into cyber systems by connecting various devices, which sense and control the surrounding objects. For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrow-band signals because of multipath propagation. In this work, we design a positioning system using narrow-band signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing Received Signal Strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software defined radio techniques. In the given experiment results, we find that the positioning system achieves a mean positioning accuracy of 1.61m, which represents a 36.1% improvement over traditional RSS-based fingerprinting.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays a key role in connecting the e-health system with the cyber world through new services and seamless interconnection between heterogeneous devices. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy, and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.},

abstract={With the advent of Internet of Things, remote patient monitoring and diagnosis is becoming the more advanced and accessible feature in healthcare industry regardless of age and disorder. With the increase in patient population, remotely prioritizing and diagnosing patients becomes a major problem. Research has been conducted to address this issue. However, many models fail to support the condition of comorbidity. In this paper, we developed a multi-task machine learning model that supports remote patient prioritization based on disease severity. This model not only considers patients diagnosed with a single disease, but also acknowledges comorbidity of a patient to calculate their severity utilizing physiological data. Classifying a comorbid patient based on their disease(s) severity is a challenging task. We achieve this by exploiting the commonalities and differences between the diseases using multi-task machine learning. Based on the correlation between diseases, we classify the patient into appropriate severity level. In addition to this, our model also supports continuous patient monitoring based on their severity levels, which is made possible by implementing in Apache Spark. Apache Spark also serves as a real-time streaming processor suitable for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis.},

abstract={Future Internet of Things (IoT) networks are expected to support a massive number of heterogeneous devices/sensors in diverse applications ranging from eHealthcare to industrial control systems. In highly-dense deployment scenarios such as industrial IoT systems, providing reliable communication links with low-latency becomes challenging due to the involved system delay including data acquisition and processing latencies at the edge-side of IoT networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a priority-based channel access and data aggregation scheme at the Cluster Head (CH) to reduce channel access and queuing delays in a clustered industrial IoT network. First, a prioritized channel access mechanism is developed by assigning different Medium Access Control (MAC) layer attributes to the packets coming from two types of IoT nodes, namely, high-priority and low-priority nodes, based on the application-specific information provided from the cloud-center. Subsequently, a preemptive M/G/1 queuing model is employed by using separate low-priority and high- priority queues before sending aggregated data to the Cloud. Our results show that the proposed priority-based method significantly improves the system latency and reliability as compared to the non-prioritized scheme.},

LBA-Ie is self-organized and adaptive algorithm by taking into account the changes occurred within the network, the links situations and the objects parameters. LBA-Ie is evaluated in terms of QoS (Quality of Service) and energy efficiency. The simulation results are compared to those obtained by three other solutions. LBA-Ie improves the QoS of IoT communications by increasing the data reliability which improves then the e-health applications. LBA-Ie allows also economizing the consumed energy by the objects and increase then their average lifetime.},

abstract={In the last years, traffic over wireless networks has been increasing exponentially, due to the impact of Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities. Current networks must adapt to and cope with the specific requirements of IoT applications since resources can be requested on-demand simultaneously by multiple devices on different locations. One of these requirements is low latency, since even a small delay for an IoT application such as health monitoring or emergency service can drastically impact their performance. To deal with this limitation, the Fog computing paradigm has been introduced, placing cloud resources on the edges of the network to decrease the latency. However, deciding which edge cloud location and which physical hardware will be used to allocate a specific resource related to an IoT application is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the IoT application service placement problem is proposed, which considers multiple optimization objectives such as low latency and energy efficiency.

abstract={Fall related injuries are major problems for elderly people leaving alone at home. Most of people who have fallen cannot get up without assistance. Absence of movement of person after fall may cause severe complications regarding health. Considering these problems for elderly we propose a fall detection system for elderly based on computer vision technology. Considering advantages of this technology over wearable based sensor such patients don't need to wear any sensor on body avoiding discomfort due to wearable one. We propose a system in which it is able to detect fall event by detecting features from scene captured by single camera. Features detected are orientation angle, aspect ratio, centre of mass and Hu moment invariants. To reduce computation time in real situation minimum features are used to detect fall. We have also applied IOT (Internet of Things) approach to notify about accident through email with attached screenshot of scene and video recorded after fall. One can also view live streaming of room by entering IP address of raspberry pi on browser if he wishes to see. Camera interfacing and internet connection is done through raspberry pi3 model B which is just like a mini computer with Operating system embedded into its SD card. Overall we propose an automated fall detection system with computer vision and IOT approach.},

abstract={The increasing deployment of smart devices using mobile networks is pushing operators to consider efficient ways to tailor their infrastructure to the Internet of Things (IoT) diverse requirements and traffic characteristics. A promising approach to address this need is the novel concept of network slicing, which aims at allocating portions of network resources to specific tenants, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), IoT, e-health, connected vehicles, etc. While this has been traditionally done with long-term agreements between network operators and tenants as MVNOs, in this work we focus on a new business model where network operators offer network slices as a service (SlaaS). In particular, we propose a novel system comprising an IoT Broker managing massive IoT network slices services and a Network Slice Broker that through bi-directional negotiations are able to efficiently allocate and orchestrate network resources.},

Several sensors are used for gathering the biological behaviors of a patient. The meaningful biological information are then forwarded to the IoT cloud. The system is more intelligent that can able to detect the critical condition of a patient by processing sensors data and instantly provides push notification to doctors/nurses as well as hospital in-charge personal.

abstract={Internet of things as a concept uses wireless sensor networks that have limitations in power, storage, and delay when processing and sending data to the cloud. Fog computing as an extension of cloud services to the edge of the network reduces latency and traffic, so it is very useful in healthcare, wearables, intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. Scheduling is the NP-hard issues in fog computing. Edge devices due to proximity to sensors and clouds are capable of processing power and are beneficial for resource management algorithms. We present a knapsack-based scheduling optimized by symbiotic organisms search that is simulated in iFogsim as a standard simulator for fog computing. The results show improvements in the energy consumption by 18%, total network usage by 1.17%, execution cost by 15%, and sensor lifetime by 5% in our scheduling method are better than the FCFS (First Come First Served) and knapsack algorithms.},

Sensing, monitoring, recognizing activities of daily living, ultimately delivering immediate healthcare services has been perceived as a prerequisite for detecting the health status of the users. To date, extensive research been made in above-mentioned areas, which is frequently named Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Recently, the term of Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging, which emphasizes the interconnection of all available resources both physical and virtual with the purpose of collecting and exchanging data. Thus, IoT technologies have been widely adopted for the gathering of health related resources to provide reliable and effective healthcare services especially to elderly and people with chronic diseases. Thereby, the aim of this paper is to present a brief overview of IoT enabled AAL systems and application particularly in the healthcare domain, and then identify the existing challenges and future research opportunities in this field.},

abstract={The authentication models are utilized among the various network based applications, between various homogeneous and heterogeneous network appliances, Internet of things (IoT) applications, Healthcare applications, etc. The authentication models relies upon the encryption models for the protection of data during the propagation of the keys over the communication media. A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm. The proposed model has been undergone various experimental scenarios, where it has been found improved than the existing model in the terms of bit difference, overall time and average time.},

abstract={Lately, Internet-based solutions, brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computation and storage technologies, have been driving revolutionary approaches in innumerable domains, including the sensitive domain of healthcare. Indicatively, real-time diagnosis of medical issues, telemedicine, remote monitoring of patients, as well as computer-assisted smart transportation in case of emergencies, are anticipated as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) that can execute several applications of different criticality, thus necessitating mission-critical and non-critical peripheral components. Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system. The main cricalities anticipated in such systems are described, as well as open areas for future research are also identified.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is a growing technology which makes use of smart objects where connection and communication between the smart objects took place. IoT is used in many application areas like entertainment, medical, transport, agriculture, security, E-health, etc. even though there are many issues in IoT, one of the main issues during recent years is power management. The need for power management in smart homes focuses on reducing electricity cost and avoiding the high peak demand problems. For reducing electricity cost, another source of power can be used. The most preferable primary power unit will be solar power due to its availability in nature. This paper prioritizes the operation of power units. The proposed system consists of a controller, a photovoltaic system with battery, smart electrical appliance and smart communication network. The main use of the controller is to schedule the power units which may be solar power, battery power and grid supply. The proposed system uses Battery Energy Storage and Management (BESM) algorithm, which helped to reduce electricity cost. The smart controller works on BESM algorithm which picks up power units according to demand. There will be energy conversion from DC to AC so to improve quality of power, Selective Harmonic Elimination(SHE) method. This paper focuses on end user's income level and also the users' difficulty in managing power usage with time varying prices. The proposed system will consider environmental factors like room temperature, outside temperature and user habits like appliance usage frequency, appliance usage characteristics.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network has wide potential application in many fields such as military, agricultural and healthcare. However, it also has some vulnerabilities because of its openness. For this reason, many researchers have proposed various user authentication schemes for added security of wireless sensor networks. Recently, Wu et al. proposed an authentication scheme for multi-gateway wireless sensor networks in Internet of Things deployment. Wu et al. claimed that their scheme is secure against user forgery attack and session key leakage. However, we found that the scheme is vulnerable to outsider and user impersonation attacks. In this paper, we revisit Wu et al.'s scheme and analyze its vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Industrial Internet of things (IIoTs) is an emerging technology with a huge number of smart connected devices having sensing, storage, and computing capabilities. IIoTs has been used in wide range of applications such as-transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy management in smart grids (SG). Most of the solutions reported in the literature may not be suitable for the aforementioned applications due to the usage of traditional TCP/IP- based network infrastructure. So, to handle these challenges, in this paper, an SDN-enabled multi-attribute secure communication model for IIoT environment is designed. The proposed scheme works in three phases: 1) an SDN-IIoT communication model is designed using a cuckoo filter-based fast forwarding scheme, 2) an attribute- based encryption scheme is presented for secure data communication, and 3) a peer entity authentication scheme using a third party authenticator, kerberos is also presented. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using different parameters where the results obtained prove its effectiveness.},

Objective of this work is to design water bottles which intimate a person to intake water on time to keep body temperature in stable. With busy schedules of humans and endless distractions, it's hard to remember to drink enough water by the humans. One of the health issues is not drinking sufficient amount of water properly in a human's daily life. Here the water float sensor can be used to sense the level of the water and it not only helps the users to measure the level of water, but also indicates the human to drink water when it's time to top up their body. This is a user-friendly project, that water bottle or flask can speaks with the person via passing commands as a message to drink sufficient water. The IoT experiment facility describes in this paper is conceived to provide a suitable platform for a large scale experimentation and evaluation of IoT concept under real life conditions.},

abstract={A smart city is an interconnected entity of internet of things and intelligent systems to provide qualify services to its citizens in various sectors such as public safety, healthcare, transportation and energy. In order for users to get the provided services, they have to access these services, provide and exchange a lot of personal information in an open, unsafe and interconnected environment. Therefore, user information may be exposed to privacy violations, which is especially critical for healthcare related services. Privacy engineering challenges that are not considered in design and development of these services may lead to possible privacy holes and leakage points, which raise concerns among users. In this paper, a privacy engineering approach and safeguard framework are proposed for smart city healthcare services. The paper aims to understand the privacy holes, identify the privacy leakage points and study privacy requirements to propose a privacy safeguard design solution.},

abstract={The PATH2iot open-source platform presents a new approach to stream processing for Internet of Things applications by automatically partitioning and deploying the computation over the available infrastructure (e.g. cloud, field gateways and sensors) in order to meet non-functional requirements including energy, performance and security. The user gives a high-level declarative description of computation in the form of Event Processing Language queries. These are compiled, optimised, and partitioned to meet the non-functional requirements using database system techniques and cost models extended to meet the needs of IoT analytics. The paper describes the PATH2iot system, illustrated by a real-world digital healthcare analytics example, with sensor battery life as the main non-functional requirement to be optimised. It shows that the tool can automatically partition and distribute the computation across a healthcare wearable, a mobile phone and the cloud - increasing the battery life of the smart watch by 416% when compared to other possible allocations. The PATH2iot system can therefore automatically bring the benefits of fog/edge computing to IoT applications.},

As such, IoT systems do not just handle critical information as passwords, identities, personal information, routines, etc., but they also are able to control a whole variety of systems, for instance a robotic network in the automotive industry, autonomous cars networks, human health care and many systems in other domains. Hence, the existence of IoT systems that do not involve security mechanisms should be unthinkable; nevertheless there are not new standards which take into account the security of these systems. This proposal introduces a new UML extension which involves security issues encapsulated within a nomenclature, UML stereotypes to model common actors and UML notation extensions. All this with the aim of providing IoT developers with an useful notation to model security in IoT system from their designing stage, even if they are not completely familiar with cybersecurity concepts.},

abstract={Meeting application requirements under a tight power budget is of a primary importance to enable connected health internet of things (IoT) applications. This paper considers using sparse representation and well-defined inequality indexes drawn from the theory of inequality to distinguish ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) from non-VEBs. Our approach involves designing a separate dictionary for each arrhythmia class using a set of labelled training QRS complexes. Sparse representation, based on the designed dictionaries of each new test QRS complex is then calculated. Following this, its class is predicted using the winner-takes-all principle by selecting the class with the highest inequality index. Our experiments showed promising results ranging between 80% and 100% for the detection of VEBs considering the patient-specific approach, 80% using cross-validation and 70% on unseen data using independent sets for training and testing respectively. An efficient hardware implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is also presented. The results show that the proposed hardware implementation can classify a QRS complex in 69.3 ms that use only 0.934 W energy.},

abstract={Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage.},

The symbiotic relationship between fish, plants, and bacteria, in a controlled environment, is contingent upon optimal water quality conditions. This calls for a need to develop continuous water-quality monitoring techniques that are based on intelligent data acquisition, communication, and processing. This work focuses on using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to configure and deploy smart water-quality sensors that provide remote, continuous, and real-time information of indicators related to water quality, on a graphical user interface (GUI). A sensing system comprising of a Raspberry Pi and commercial sensor circuits 1 and probes that measure Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, and water temperature was deployed in an aquaponics facility in a town called Manchay, near Lima, Peru2. Data acquired from the sensor system is uploaded to ThingSpeak 3, an IoT analytics platform service that provides real-time data visualization and analysis. Continuous monitoring of this data, and making necessary adjustments, will facilitate the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem that is conducive to the growth of fish and plants, while utilizing about 90% less water than traditional farming.},

abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},

The Ecuadorian Armed Forces are trying to equip their soldiers with IoT Technology to monitor and visualize in real time the state of health during combat missions. However, the implementation and research, at least in Ecuador; has been very complex due to two problems: (1) organization in the design and the integration of the components and applications when participate several researchers and engineers of multiple disciplines (e.g, control, software) and (2) the complex implementation due to the technological fragmentation between the military contexts (e.g., air force, army and navy). We propose an approach to the solution to the implementation of real-time military health monitoring in combat missions, using the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm and the research model proposed by Takeuchi & Nonaka. We were able to obtain a meta-model delineated in the 4 domains of the IoT Technology embedded within the 4 contexts of a product line process.

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors. The readings are shown in the form of graphs at IBM Watson IoT platform.},

abstract={With the growing popularity of sensors and the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), there is exponential growth in data. Sensors are collecting data for various domains like traffic, predictive maintenance, equipment health, meteorology etc. Mostly, data collected by IoT devices or sensors is of heterogeneous format which is difficult to interpret and integrate. With the rise in applications of sensors there is a need to manage, store and intelligently analyse this data stream. The SSN Ontology can describe sensors in terms of capabilities, measurement processes, observations, and deployments. In this paper, we propose a framework using ontologies and JADE Agents to intelligently analyse and handle the streaming data. Furthermore, JADE Agents allows dynamically monitoring and updating of the knowledge base.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly being recognized by researchers, companies and analysts all over the world as one of the most advanced technologies that has the capacity to revolutionize the behaviour of everything around us. It possesses the potential to not only affect the health, safety and productivity of billions of people but also has a major economic impact. Inspired by the idea of “smart technologies” and “home automation”, we propose an IoT framework with smart-sensing based automatic appliance control. This paper presents a method and an implementation technique for the management of smart-appliances. A prototype has been developed and tested to verify the efficacy of the implemented technique. The results show that such prototypes can be influential in making home appliances smart enough to operate only when required. The broad application of the proposed work will lead to greater economic benefits, in terms of increasing infrastructure intelligence, and will also have social impacts in terms of global sustainability.},

abstract={Internet of Things is the new revolution that is going to impact every facet of our lives. Internet of Things (IoT) is the new technology which includes the collection of Sensors, Actuators, processors and other development boards (eg. Raspberry pi, Arduino etc) to collect the data from different sources depending upon domain of application, process the acquired data before sending to distant cloud or mobile application depending upon the requirement[7]. The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe. MQTT is a lightweight protocol which is developed for a machine to machine (M2M) communication.},

abstract={As the world population is growing at a rapid pace, the demand for better health care facilities is increasing steadily. It has been observed that many health problems are unpredictable; especially heart diseases; hence it is important to monitor heart continuously. Earlier it was not always possible to monitor the patient continuously and for longer durations, but thanks to the latest developments in the domain of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), that facilitate the acquirement, transmission, interpretation and reception of various bio-signals, from permanent or mobile sites. The developments in the sphere of sensing technologies, wireless communication, embedded systems, nano-electronics, etc make it feasible to build intelligent systems to monitor bio-signals especially heart signals (ECG) of the patient; and further with the help of necessary protocols, the information can be promptly sent to the doctor, hospitals, etc. Thanks to the concept of Internet-of-Things (IoT), which provides necessary help in emergency situations. Nanomaterials are now being used in a big way because of their several advantages over the conventional materials. So, getting together the concept of IoT and nanomaterials will restructure the field of health-care, promising economic, technological and social benefits.},

Since wristband-type wearable devices, one of IoT (Internet of Things) devices are getting popular on campus, this study has implemented a monitoring system using the devices for the purpose of assisting students' health consciousness. One example of the experimental results shows that a student has successfully improved his BMI (Body Mass Index) by 2.48 from 30.6 in 12 weeks. The implemented system allows sharing vital data sensed from wearable devices so that peer support becomes possible and the student's engagement in health consciousness is maintained.

abstract={The constant rapid growth and development of modern medical technology has resulted in an ever-growing demand for higher quality health monitoring systems. This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has become a pervasive and diverse concept in recent years. IoT applications and services have given rise to a number of sub-fields in the IoT space. Wearable technology, with its particular set of characteristics and application domains, has formed a rapidly growing sub-field of IoT, viz., Wearable Internet of Things (WIoT). While numerous wearable devices are available in the market today, security and privacy are key factors for wide adoption of WIoT. Wearable devices are resource constrained by nature with limited storage, power, and computation. A Cloud-Enabled IoT (CEIoT) architecture, a dominant paradigm currently shaping the industry and suggested by many researchers, needs to be adopted for WIoT. In this paper, we develop an access control framework for cloud-enabled WIoT (CEWIoT) based on the Access Control Oriented (ACO) architecture recently developed for CEIoT in general. We first enhance the ACO architecture from the perspective of WIoT by adding an Object Abstraction Layer, and then develop our framework based on interactions between different layers of this enhanced ACO architecture. We present a general classification and taxonomy of IoT devices, along with brief introduction to various application domains of IoT and WIoT. We then present a remote health and fitness monitoring use case to illustrate different access control aspects of our framework and outline its possible enforcement in a commercial CEIoT platform, viz., AWS IoT. Finally, we discuss the objectives of our access control framework and relevant open problems.},

abstract={In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, prognostic and health management (PHM) systems are used to collect massive real-time data from mechanical equipment. PHM big data has the characteristics of large-volume, diversity, and high-velocity. Effectively mining features from such data and accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the rotating components with new advanced methods become issues in PHM. Traditional data driven prognostics is based on shallow learning architectures, requires establishing explicit model equations and much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and prognostic expertise, and therefore is limited in the age of big data. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for RUL prediction of rotating components with big data. The presented approach is tested and validated using data collected from a gear test rig and bearing run-to-failure tests and compared with existing PHM methods. The test results show the promising RUL prediction performance of the deep learning-based approach.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extremely fragmented market and can be defined as anything from sensors to small servers. It is estimated that over 30 billion IoT devices will ship by 2020. The ability to sense countless amounts of information that communicates to the cloud is driving innovation into IoT applications, such as in wearable devices (for health, fitness or infotainment applications) and in machine-to-machine applications (in smart appliances, smart cities or commerce). It has become crucial for today's IoT chips to use a range of new solutions during the design stage to ensure the robustness of manufacturing test, field reliability and security. DFT designers need to use new test and reliability solutions to enable power reductions during test, concurrent test, isolated debug and diagnosis, pattern porting, calibration, and uniform access. Moreover, the per unit IoT price remains a key factor in high volume production. Thus, minimizing the test cost while meeting the above technical issues is one of the major challenges of the IoT industry. This presentation, besides discussing the key trends and challenges of IoT, will cover solutions to handle the wide range of potential robustness challenges during all periods of the IoT lifecycle from design, post silicon bring-up, volume production, to in-system operation.},

abstract={With the advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), we could efficiently improve our daily life activities like health care, monitoring, transportation, smart homes etc. Artificial Intelligence along with Machine learning has played a very supportive role to analyze various situations and take decisions accordingly. Maneuver anticipation supplements existing Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by anticipating mishaps and giving drivers more opportunity to respond to road circumstances proactively. The capacity to sort the driver conduct is extremely beneficial for advance driver assistance system (ADAS). Deep learning solutions would further be an endeavor of for driving conduct recognition. A technique for distinguishing driver's conduct is imperative to help operative mode transition between the driver and independent vehicles. We propose a novel approach of dissecting driver's conduct by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and a combination of Convolutional Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that would give better results in less response time. We are likewise proposing to concentrate high level features and interpretable features depicting complex driving examples by trying CNN, RNN and then CNN with LSTM. We could improve the system accuracy to 95% by combining CNN with LSTM.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is the prelude to new technological innovation. It expands with different applications such as smart home, smart city, smart grids, smart car, smart healthcare and smart retail. The application of IoT in Healthcare system brings high value for the elderly, victims of chronic disease and those who require constant supervision. But there are many security issues in such application. Moreover, the medical devices used in the IoT enabled Healthcare System are resource constrained devices. So, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for authenticating such resource constrained medical devices. New algorithm for secure authentication and key agreement of the medical devices is also presented. This mechanism is resistance against various security attacks such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and Denial of Service attacks. Formal security analysis and the comparative study presented in this paper have proved that the proposed mechanism has many security features and highly secure among the already existing authentication mechanisms.},

abstract={Massive deployment of low data rate Internet of things and eHealth devices that require high reliability motivates the development of practical precoding and user selection techniques. In this paper, we show that throughput and communications reliability can be improved by incorporating knowledge of modulation type in the design of the multiuser transmit precoder. The transmission of low data rate one-dimensionally modulated signals in a broadcast channel is considered. The transmit precoding matrix is determined by minimizing the weighted sum of error probabilities of users. Although the proposed minimum probability of error (MPE) precoding problem is nonconvex and highly nonlinear, it is solved by the alternating minimization of two convex subproblems. A reduced-complexity version of convex MPE precoding is then introduced, which exponentially reduces the complexity of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed precoding techniques significantly improve system performance in broadcast channels. A user selection algorithm, compatible with MPE precoding, is also proposed that selects users if their error probabilities can approach zero. Based on line packing principles in Grassmannian manifolds, it is shown that the number of selected users could potentially be more than the number of transmit antennas, which translates to supporting more simultaneous users in the shared channel compared to existing user selection methods.},

abstract={Wearable internet of things (IoT) devices are becoming popular due to their small form factor and low cost. Potential applications include human health and activity monitoring by embedding sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate sensor. However, these devices have severely limited battery capacity, which requires frequent recharging. Harvesting ambient energy and optimal energy allocation can make wearable IoT devices practical by eliminating the charging requirement. This paper presents a near-optimal runtime energy management technique by considering the harvested energy. The proposed solution maximizes the performance of the wearable device under minimum energy constraints. We show that the results of the proposed algorithm are, on average, within 3% of the optimal solution computed offline.},

abstract={The Internet of Things promises tremendous benefits in our everyday life where healthcare is one of the application areas in which IoT has also paved its way for the development of human assistance technologies. With smart sensing and remote monitoring, peoples' health conditions can be assessed more effectively but to provide IoT services such as depressive disorder assistance still, there are many challenges to overcome. A huge number of connected heterogeneous devices and enormous amounts of data generated by these devices are not only difficult to manage but providing services with them in a dynamic IoT environment, count for significant efforts. There is a requirement for mechanisms that not only cater the heterogeneity of IoT devices but also provide dynamic services efficiently based on user requirements. Web of Objects (WoO) platform enables IoT services by virtualizing real world objects using semantic ontology. It provides a base for the development of interoperable microservices which support dynamic features by utilizing streams of sensory data. This paper proposes a Microservices Model in WoO based IoT platform to provide services for depressive disorder assistance. In addition, a Real World Knowledge (RWK) model of user situations and emotions has also been developed.},

Smart consumer sensors and cognitive systems are synergized through the Internet of Things (IoT) for optimal information sharing, communication, real-time updates, data analytics, and enhanced support for decision making. Biometric-based devices, originally intended for large-scale applications in airports, border controls, disaster zones, or refugee migration zones, are enabling a wide range of applications in commercial and consumer sectors as standalone systems or with interconnected sensor networks. This article introduces the applications of Microsoft Kinect in cognitive systems for smart CE, and, using Kinect sensors, a human-behavior cognition technology is presented for gesture and activity recognition. As a novel front end of pervasive cognitive systems, the challenges and applications of a Kinect sensor-based system will be explored in CE, such as smart automobiles, health care, surveillance, and activity recognition.},

abstract={The advent of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and home automation, has taken the IoT concept from hype to reality at a massive scale. However, more mission-critical application areas such as energy, security and health care do not only demand low-power connectivity, but also highly reliable and guaranteed performance. While fulfilling these requirements under controlled conditions such as urban and indoor environments is relatively trivial, tackling the same obstacles in a more challenging and dynamic setting is significantly more complicated. In environments where infrastructure is sparse, such as rural or remote areas, specialized infrastructure-less ad-hoc solutions are needed, which provide long-range multi-hop connectivity to remote sensors and actuators. In this paper we propose a new general-purpose IoT platform based on a combination of Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (LoWPAN) and multi-hop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology. It supports reliable and guaranteed real-time data dissemination and analysis, as well as actuator control, in dynamic and challenging infrastructure-less environments. In this paper, we present the IoT platform architecture and an initial hard- and software prototype. Moreover, a use case based on real-time monitoring and training adaptation for cyclists is presented. Based on this case study, evaluation results are presented that show the ability of the proposed platform to operate under challenging and dynamic conditions.},

pages={2129-2141},
abstract={Wireless ad-hoc networks are becoming popular due to the emergence of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Due to the open wireless medium, secure routing functionality becomes important. However, the current solutions focus on a constrain set of network vulnerabilities and do not provide protection against newer attacks. In this paper, we propose SCOTRES—a trust-based system for secure routing in ad-hoc networks which advances the intelligence of network entities by applying five novel metrics. The energy metric considers the resource consumption of each node, imposing similar amount of collaboration, and increasing the lifetime of the network. The topology metric is aware of the nodes’ positions and enhances load-balancing. The channel-health metric provides tolerance in periodic malfunctioning due to bad channel conditions and protects the network against jamming attacks. The reputation metric evaluates the cooperation of each participant for a specific network operation, detecting specialized attacks, while the trust metric estimates the overall compliance, safeguarding against combinatorial attacks. Theoretic analysis validates the security properties of the system. Performance and effectiveness are evaluated in the network simulator 2, integrating SCOTRES with the DSR routing protocol. Similar schemes are implemented using the same platform in order to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, SCOTRES is deployed on two typical embedded system platforms and applied on real CPSs for monitoring environmental parameters of a rural application on olive groves. As is evident from the above evaluations, the system provides the highest level of protection while retaining efficiency for real application deployments.},

abstract={Slope failure and debris flow cause lots of casualties and property loss. An early-warning system for slope collapse and debris flow is essential to ensure safety of human beings and assets. Based on fiber optic sensing technology and Internet of Things, a new sensing transducer for internal earth pressure measurement in a soil slope is proposed, fabricated, and tested in this paper. The working principles, theoretical analysis, laboratory calibrations, and discussions of the proposed pressure transducers are elaborated. Extensive evaluations of the resolutions, physical properties, and response to the applied pressures have been performed through modeling and experimentations. The results show that the sensitivity of the designed pressure sensor is 0.1287 kPa/με across a pressure range of 140 kPa. Finally, a field soil slope was instrumented with the developed fiber optic sensors and other sensors. Through internet and cloud computing platform, the stability of the soil slope was analyzed. In the cloud computing platform, the numerical simulation is carried out by considering the slope internal deformations, rainfall infiltration, and limit force equilibrium. The factor of safety of the soil slope was calculated, which could be used to determine health condition of the instrumented slope. The performance was evaluated and classified into three categories. It proves that the proposed early-warning system has potential to monitor the health condition of the soil slopes.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices are getting increasingly popular, becoming a core element for the next generations of informational architectures: smart city, smart factory, smart home, smart health-care and many others. IoT systems are mainly comprised of embedded devices with limited computing capabilities while having a cloud component which processes the data and delivers it to the end-users. IoT devices access the user private data, thus requiring robust security solution which must address features like usability and scalability. In this paper we discuss about an IoT authentication service for smart-home devices using a smart-phone as security anchor, QR codes and attribute based cryptography (ABC). Regarding the fact that in an IoT ecosystem some of the IoT devices and the cloud components may be considered untrusted, we propose a privacy preserving attribute based access control protocol to handle the device authentication to the cloud service. For the smart-phone centric authentication to the cloud component, we employ the FIDO UAF protocol and we extend it, by adding an attributed based privacy preserving component.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging subject which enables multiple applications and requires robust security solutions. IoT architectures contribute to critical aspects of our society like transportation, health-care, industry, telecommunications and many others. Security is difficult to be implemented in the IoT context because the embedded devices are resource constrained and deployed in uncontrolled areas, thus being targeted by various security attacks. In scenarios like smart city, IoT networks are populated by both trusted and untrusted transient devices, thus mechanisms for mitigating complex security attacks must be implemented. Embedded networks with near real-time constraints are subject to denial-of-service attacks which can easily affect the applications availability by injecting malicious packets into the network. This paper proposes a lightweight security mechanism which addresses DoS attacks in IoT publish-subscribe applications.},

abstract={Advances in multimedia technologies have led to the emergence of smart home applications. In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants’ activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcaremonitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes. Our proposed methodology models activities based on spatially recognized actions, with every activity expected to have a direct relationship with a specific set of locations. Furthermore, the proposed technique validates the assignment of labels based on the temporal relations among consecutive actions. We performed experiments to evaluate our proposed methodology on CASAS datasets, which indicated that the proposed methodology achieved better performance, to a statistically significant extent, than state-of-the-art methodologies presented in the literature.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) presents opportunities to address a variety of systemic, metabolic healthcare issues. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are among the greatest contributors to premature death worldwide. Wireless wearable continuous monitoring systems (CMS) such as ECG sensors connected to the Internet of Things can greatly decrease the risk of death related to cardiac issues by providing valuable long-term information to physicians, as well as immediate contact with emergency services in the event of a heart attack or stroke. In this report we discuss the fabrication, characterization and validation of composite fabric ECG sensors made from Nylon coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGOx) as part of a self-powered wearable IoT sensor. We utilize an electronic probing station to measure electrical properties, take live ECG data to measure signal reliability, and provide detailed surface characterization through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, bonding between the layers of the composite and between composite and the Nylon is analyzed by Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.},

abstract={Temperature monitoring of medicines is essential for product quality and patient safety. Product quality is influenced by temperature perturbations and time delays in interventions. Thanks to Internet of Things (IoT) considerable progress has been made in recent years in the improvement of temperature monitoring devices. However, temperature monitoring in medicine Cold Chain remains challenging. In this paper it is presented a conceptual model aiming at overcoming challenges of medicine Cold Chain related to temperature monitoring. The major particularity of our model is that it considers the complete Cold Chain according to two perspectives of pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in a single study. Besides this model can be applied also in vaccine Cold Chain and in temperature-controlled logistics of laboratory medicine. Our conceptual model supports the development of a smart Cold Chain system for temperature monitoring based on IoT. Our smart Cold Chain system can be used to improve Cold Chain responsiveness by studying weaknesses and deciding what Cold Chain characteristics to improve.},

abstract={Nowadays, systems for various smart city industries such as city power plants, public transportation and integrated modular avionics are becoming increasingly complicated, with most of components being embedded and geologically distributed. In order to ensure the availability of target systems, prognostic and health management develops as an important system to assess the current health state and estimate the future health state based on modern Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and cloud computing technologies. The early design of PHM systems requires system engineering methodology to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of systems. However, as the complexity grows, there may be some misunderstanding in specification that are not obvious and it is hard to perform verification and evaluation in a more intuitive way. In order to enhance the intuitiveness and reduce the misunderstanding in early development stage, we present a visual model-based framework to simulate and evaluate the cloud-based prognostics and health management systems. The framework proposes a three-abstraction-layer hierarchical architecture to represent distributed data sources and cloud-based PHM service center. The design of the framework is based on system modeling language and allows flexible algorithm implementations of function modules. The simulation of framework is visualized through the animated behavior diagrams. Furthermore, we propose a performance evaluation and measurement method combining quality of maintenance analysis and cost-benefit analysis for PHM systems.},

abstract={Nowadays, the market of healthcare is experiencing a rapid growth and is believed to be dramatically massive due to the upcoming global aging. The medical internet of things (IoTs) is endowed with expectation to fulfil the rigid demand, which requires the all kinds of digital medical devices linked and accessed to the internet to acquire all the parameters related to the personalized health, such as medical images, biochemical and biophysical parameters. The acquisition and transmission of the tremendous amount of biomedical information required high bandwidth and fast speed. The next generation communication technology-5G is capable of providing the suitable information infrastructure for the emerging IoTs application. The ubiquitous smartphone is the best information transfer station and considered as the point of personalized medical data acquisition. In this manuscript, we presented a medical dongle powered by the smartphone as a miniaturized electrochemical analyzer for blood glucose and uric acid monitoring. The family doctor can access the related biomedical information of his patient and give the precise, personalized and preventive healthcare consults. In addition, the accuracy and reliability of the proposed system were verified with good agreement as compared to the bulky biochemical analyzer in clinical use. In the emerging medical IoTs application, the proposed system is significantly promising solution since it united the biosensors, internet communication, information processing and family doctor together to provide the completed health care for each user.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept that is directing a huge increase in the Internet and its capability to collect, investigate and distribute data which can be turned into information or knowledge. Certain environments are proposed that are smart and self aware by direct communication between devices of various types that are part of the IoT. One category of devices such as the Low Power Lossy networks (LLNs) consists of numerous small sensors and low power devices as building block elements in IoT. The ROLL working group at Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT) has designed the Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) which is the core of the IoT protocol stack used for communication between these low-power devices. To our knowledge experimentation and evaluation of RPL is very much needed and not much done so far. A few simulation tools exist which enable evaluation of RPL for a realistic deployment scenario. This paper focuses on understanding of the architecture and protocol stack of RPL and thereby its place in IoT. The performance of RPL is carried out for a Smart Health environment scenario by the simulations done in the Contiki OS Cooja simulator with respect to the performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, latency, signalling overhead and energy consumption. The simulation results reveal that the RPL has shown certain suitable characteristics which may make it useful for larger scale deployments.},

abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in communication technologies have enabled homes, cars even whole cities to be network connected. However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can be considered as a promising solution for detecting, reporting emergency events, eliminating the hoax calls and responding swiftly saving lives.},

abstract={Over the next years the demand of wireless communication will increase tremendously. More and more mobile end devices require a high data rate connection e.g. to a smart home (Internet of Things, IoT) or to the internet. The radiation power pattern of base stations and mobile end devices will completely change for the 5G technology. Therefore the electromagnetic exposure especially to human body will increase in the future, because most of the wireless connections are realized in RF technology. In this contribution two different measurement setups are presented. The first shows the electromagnetic radiation regarding a base station powered by a mobile phone provider over a timespan of a number of days. The second figures out the electromagnetic radiation of a handheld mobile end device to a human head in an area with very poor reception values. The results of those measurements where compared with legal and health limits. All measured and calculated results regarding the base stations were within the legal exposure limits. The calculated legal exposure limits of mobile devices were exceeded twice in areas within very poor reception values. Regarding the expected higher bandwidth and corresponding higher electromagnetic exposure to human bodies in future there have to be periodic measurements to comply with radiation limits.},

abstract={Air pollution is an important issue due to its direct impact on human health. To cope with this problem, in urban areas a “monitor and react” approach, based on measurements provided use of static monitoring stations, is commonly adopted introducing constrains to the amount of areas that can be monitored within the city. With the rise of the Internet of Things paradigm, new air monitoring models based on mobile sensors networks have been proposed. In this paper, we present the concept of Bus as a Sensor (BaaS): an air quality monitoring system based on mobile sensor nodes placed upon buses. This work aims to provide a high resolution air quality map to report pollutants measurements and facilitate the analysis to support the government decisions in order to reduce the pollution. The proposed paper describes the system architecture and the requirements of sensor nodes to depict the implementation concepts and lay the foundations for future experiments on field. A preliminary end-to-end prototype of the BaaS solution has been already developed at the TIM Joint Open Lab based in Catania and some tests have been successfully carried out within the University campus.},

abstract={Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is assumed to provide health services by incorporating social networks and the internet of things (IoT). Although much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the m-Therapy framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is emerging as one of the popular technologies influencing every aspect of human life. The IoT devices equipped with sensors are changing every domain of the world to become smarter. In particular, the majorly benifited service sectors are agriculture, industries, healthcare, control & automation, retail & logistics, and power & energy. The data generated in these areas is massive requiring bigger storage and stronger compute. On the other hand, the IoT devices are limited in processing and storage capabilities and can not store and process the sensed data locally. Hence, there is a dire need to integrate these devices with the external data sources for effective utilisation and assessment of the collected data. Several existing well-known message exchange protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are applicable in IoT communications. However, a thorough study is required to understand their impact and suitability in IoT scenario for the exchange of information between external data sources and IoT devices. In this paper, we designed and implemented an application layer framework to test and understand the behavior of these protocols and conducted the experiments on a realistic test bed using wired, wifi and 2/3/4G networks. The results revealed that MQTT and AMQP perform well on wired and wireless connections whereas CoAP performs consistently well and is less network dependent. On the lossy networks, CoAP generates low traffic as compared to MQTT and AMQP. The low memory footprint of MQTT and CoAP has made them a better choice over AMQP.},

pages={10-18},
abstract={Research in the area of internet-of-things, cyberphysical-systems, and smart health often employ sensor systems at residences for continuous monitoring. Such research-oriented residential monitoring systems (RRMSs) usually face two major challenges, long-term reliable operation management and validation of system functionality with minimal human effort. Targeting these two challenges, this paper describes a monitor of monitoring systems with ground-truth validation capabilities, M2G. It consists of two subsystems, the Monitor2 system and the Ground-truth validation system. The Monitor2 system encapsulates a flexible set of general-purpose components to monitor the operation and connectivity of heterogeneous sensor devices (e.g. smart watches, smart phones, microphones, beacons, etc.), a local base-station, as well as a cloud server. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports different types of RRMSs in various contexts. The system also features a ground truth validation system to support obtaining ground truth in the field. Additionally, customized alerts can be sent to remote administrators and other personnel to report any dysfunction or inaccuracy of the system in real time. M2G is applied to three very different case studies: the M2FED system which monitors family eating dynamics [1], an in-home wireless sensing system for monitoring nighttime agitation [2], and the BESI system which monitors behavioral and environmental parameters to predict health events and to provide interventions [3]. The results indicate that M2G is a comprehensive system that (i) requires small cost in time and effort to adapt to an existing RRMS, (ii) provides reliable data collection and reduction in data loss by detecting faults in real-time, and (iii) provides a convenient and timely ground truth validation facility.},

Unfortunately, all list of qualified m/e-healthcare services can be provided cost-effectively only in urban areas very good covered by broadband 4G/5G wireless communications. Unacceptably high investments are required into deployment of the optic core infrastructure for ubiquitous wide covering of sparsely populated rural, remote, and difficult for access (RRD) areas using the recent (4G) and forthcoming (5G) broadband radio access (RAN) centralized techniques, characterized by short cells ranges, because their profitability boundary exceeds several hundred residents per square km. Furthermore, the unprecedented requirements and new features of the forthcoming Internet of Things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M), and many other machine type IT-systems lead to a breakthrough in designing extremely green, flexible, and cost-effective technologies for future 5G wireless systems which will be able to reach in real time the performance extremums, tradeoff optimums and fundamental limits.

However, there are still numerous technological challenges to be solved particularly related to the time-critical Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of such applications. Runtime variations in the workload intensity as the amount of service tasks to be processed may radically affect the application performance perceived by the end-users or lead to the underutilization of resources. In order to assure the QoS of these containerized applications, monitoring is required at both container and application levels. Currently, there is a great lack of such multi-level monitoring systems. In this study, we present an architecture and implementation of a multi-level monitoring framework to ensure system health and adapt an IoT application in response to varying quantity, size and computational requirements of arrival requests. In this work, cloud application adaptation possibility includes horizontal scaling of container-based application instances.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the healthcare by providing high-quality services, lowering the costs, and increasing the efficiency of management by allowing the physical objects to integrate with computer systems to collect the sensed data and process as per the need. Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario. Finally, the paper concludes with the reported results.},

abstract={Over the past years, the worldwide population, especially in developed countries, faces a new issue: the ageing of the population. In developed countries, special attention is paid to monitoring and providing medical services to the elderly. In EU, the number of persons dealing with cardiovascular diseases is increasing. The number of persons needing special medical services depends on the economic and financial situation of each state. Romania is one of the poorest countries in EU, and this is reflected in health status of the population. This paper approaches the matter of improving the health of the population by presenting an e-Health system that has been implemented. The system in question was implemented by using the latest technologies and devices in the IoT (Internet of Things) field of research. This paper presents a pilot project implemented on a large scale in the North-East of Romania. A number of 240 family physicians were involved in this project, and throughout its implementation 360 thousand individuals had access to quality medical services, of which approx. 42 thousand were treated.},

abstract={As the number of devices (things) connected to the Internet (Internet of things: IoT) is growing, achieving robust security and privacy (S&P) is becoming increasingly challenging. With the heavy use of medical things (MT), the S&P in the medical domain poses a serious issue that continues to grow. Due to the criticality and sensitivity of the data in the healthcare domain, ensuring the S&P of the Internet of medical things (IoMT) makes matters even more problematic. Lack of proper S&P in IoMT will not only leave patients' privacy at risk but may also put patients' lives at risk. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the S&P issues of IoMT. We also provide an approach to quantify IoMT risks and demonstrate how to assess risks in two IoMT devices. This work aims to increase the S&P awareness among IoMT stakeholders by enabling them to identify and quantify potential IoMT S&P risks.},

abstract={Mobile e-health is one of the Internet of Things application that assists the healthcare organization in providing better healthcare services. Development of wireless sensor networking area has greatly increased the feasibility of a mobile e-health system since it provides wireless communication technology with promising sensor network applications. However, mobile e-health is subjected to a lot of security attacks such as sensor node cloning attack and man-in-the-middle attack. A secure e-health authentication system is one of the important approaches in order to provide high security for the whole e-health monitoring system. Considering the potential security attacks in mobile e-health application, a development of a unique identity of the e-health sensor node is proposed to provide a highly secure authentication protocol in mobile e-health. The identity of the e-health sensor node is a very important element in the proposed authentication protocol to ensure the confidentiality and the authenticity of transmitted e-health data.},

abstract={The use of sensors for the monitoring of a given environment allied to the Internet as a means of communication is popularly known as Internet of Things (IoT). The amount of information generated in this environment has led to an unprecedented increase in data collection. One of the major challenges for its development lies in the storage and the processing of this huge volume of data into acceptable measurement and analysis parameters. This research takes up this challenge by storing and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research, sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner. The data collected by the sensors show that the avarage levels of carbon monoxide are well above the international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO).},

This requires a re-design of the network architecture to ensure the coexistence of these use cases and guarantee user experience and service requirements. Therefore, 5G networks will be highly flexible and support online learning and autonomous decision making capabilities in a centralized and distributed manner to ensure highly efficient management of wireless and network resources.

abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services towards 5G.},

abstract={Internet of Things is an internetwork where people interact with the environment via sensors and machines to perform physical activities remotely. IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely via internet such as changing the room temperature by controlling an air conditioner, switching on the lights in your apartment, using smart watches to gather information about your body health (blood pressure and heart beat rate) and sends it to your private doctor to monitor it and so on. Performing a research on issues faced with IoT, it was realized that most challenges were of privacy/confidentiality and data integrity. This project further conducts research on finding ways of securing information that is shared between two or more interactive IoT devices. The main objective of the project was to develop a strategy of securing the IoT technology world. The method that was proposed to provide data security and integrity was through cryptographic methods/security algorithms that require decent memory and equitable CPU processing power. There were three security methods that were focused on in this project i.e. RSA, AES and TDES algorithms. Each of the encryption/decryption methods were presented with their detailed design and functionality. The most suitable and better performing security algorithm for IoT technology was chosen according to the measures of time, memory and processing power. With the tests performed on the proposed security algorithms, AES encryption standard seemed to perform better than other security algorithms in terms computational time, memory consumption and the required processing power. The test results also showed that it has a large encryption/decryption key size which also means better protection for data. However, through testing of the encryption methods there were shortcomings that were encountered such as inability of the security algorithms to provide authentication and encrypt different data formats such as video, picture and aud- o. The short comings will be further dealt with on the future work. The success of this research has potential impact on increasing the security of IoT internetwork which intern will increase the number of users in the IoT world.},

abstract={Among sensible goals of active and assisted living paradigm is the unobtrusive monitoring of daily living activities. Based on such monitoring, anomalies and trends can be discovered, which possibly allows for early assessment of health issues and for prevention policies. However, when dealing with the home environment, and especially with older adults, obtrusiveness, usability, and cost concerns are of the utmost relevance. Smart objects can be designed to this purpose and deployed into the home: they usually feature low data rates and are customarily implemented by relying on conventional wireless sensor network approaches (ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc). This, however, results in “ad hoc” home networking, which is somehow obtrusive, complicated, and possibly expensive. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of behavioral sensors based on the familiar and ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology, suitable for a “plug-and-play” deployment. Sensors are connected to a cloud platform, embodying a genuine Internet of Things approach. With respect to conventional approaches, much better scalability, flexibility, and inexpensiveness can be attained. The main expected drawback comes from the higher power consumption, inherently needed to sustain much higher data rates. This paper focuses on such an issue, illustrating design techniques aimed at optimizing power consumption and battery lifetime. Performance results are shown, which definitely fall within a practical range and are fully comparable with more conventional approaches.},

abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to - ake appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},

It covers multiple domains and applications such as smart home, smart healthcare, IT transportation...etc. The highly dynamic nature of the IoT environment brings to the service discovery new challenges and requirements. As a result, discovering the desirable services has become very challenging. In this paper, we aim to address the IoT service discovery problem and investigate the existing solutions to tackle this problem in many aspects, therefore we present a new and full comparative study of the most representative (or outstanding) service discovery approaches in the literature over four perspectives: (1) the IoT service description model, (2) the mechanism of IoT service discovery, (3) the adopted architecture and (4) the context awareness. After each of these perspectives, we discuss the existing solutions as well as the main challenges that face the service discovery issue in the IoT domain. Besides, we adopt a classification of the IoT service discovery approaches based on their mechanism of discovery, and we propose a set of requirements that need to be considered when defining an IoT service in the IoT domain.},

pages={2744-2757},
abstract={Recent progress in Internet of Things (IoT) platforms has allowed us to collect large amounts of sensing data. However, there are significant challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions for real-world applications. Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for predicting activities from sensor data.},

abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end to end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSN), to incorporating the internet of things (IoT), to communication links, to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise is of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and the future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level towards the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision - aking regarding their PHI/EHR. A lot of work and effort is necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/ pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},

abstract={In Internet of Things (IoT) world, there can be many sensors deployed in a system, thus their costs must be considered during the system design and material selections, in order to support massive production and deployment. Design-To-Cost (DTC) is an effective technique for this situation. In Model-Based Design (MBD), DTC cost estimates are preferred to be generated from models as one of the parameters to optimize the design. However, most cost modeling methods focus in estimation on costs associated with new product development, and much fewer discuss the estimate of the switching costs for new products that are designed leveraging previous products. In this paper, we explore certain available tools for DTC for such purposes and discuss their advantages/disadvantages. We performed an experimental study on a building PHM (Prognostic and Health Monitoring) sensing system design example, and demonstrated an approach to achieve switching cost estimation using parametric modeling by treating part of the new product as another prior product. Finally, a multi-objective optimization is used for design selection, to achieve the best trade-off between cost and performance.},

abstract={Automated Test Systems (ATSs) can join the Internet of Things (IoT) at multiple layers and benefit both the overall IoT concept as well as advance the goals of ATSs. Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data. The paper also outlines how these concepts extend to related topics such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Everything (IoE). In many ways Automated Test Systems presage the Internet of Things and certainly earn a high degree of thingosity.},

year={2017},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The diagnosis of OSA requires an overnight sleep experiment in a laboratory. However, due to limitations in relation to the number of labs and beds available, patients often need to wait a long time before being diagnosed and eventually treated. In addition, the unfamiliar environment and restricted mobility when a patient is being tested with a polysomnogram (PSG) may disturb their sleep, resulting in an incomplete or corrupted test. Therefore, it is posed that a PSG conducted in the patient’s home would be more reliable and convenient. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the e-Health system. In this paper, we implement an IoT-based wireless polysomnography system for sleep monitoring, which utilizes a battery-powered, miniature, wireless, portable, and multipurpose recorder. A Java-based PSG recording program in the personal computer is designed to save several bio-signals and transfer them into the European Data Format. These PSG records can be used to determine a patient’s sleep stages and diagnose OSA. This system is portable, lightweight, and has low power-consumption. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed PSG system, a comparison was made between the standard PSG-Alice 5® Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system. Several healthy volunteer patients participated in the PSG experiment and were monitored by both the standard PSG-Alice 5® Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system simultaneously, under the supervision of specialists at the Sleep Laboratory in Taipei Veteran General Hospital. A comparison of the results of the time-domain waveform and sleep stage of the two systems shows that the proposed system is reliable and can be applied in practice. The proposed system can facilitate the long-term tracing and research of personal sleep monitorin- at home.},

abstract={Internet-of-things can allow healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients by analyzing the sensors outputs with big data analytics. Sleeping conditions are one of the most influential factors on health. However, the literature lacks of the appropriate simulation tools to widely support the research on the recognition of sleeping postures. The current work proposes an agent-based simulation framework to simulate sleeper movements on a simulated smart bed with load sensors. This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors. This simulator can also generate logs text files with big data for applying offline big data techniques on them. The current approach is illustrated with an algorithm that properly recognized the simulated sleeping postures with an average accuracy of 98%. This accuracy is higher than the one reported by an existing alternative work in this area.},

abstract={Pollution has become an environmental concern that has put the prospects of a sustainable future at risk. Though technology is advancing at a rapid rate but the question of an eco-friendly living remains unanswered. With growing population figures, the transportation requirement is increasing at a significant rate but the vehicular pollution arising from surface transport has serious health hazards besides polluting the nature. This paper proposes the design of a Pollution Monitoring Mobile System (PMMS) that can monitor vehicular pollution in real-time along with the information about the area being monitored. The prototype consists of a primary unit, a mobile robot that has a combination of Arduino and Raspberry Pi micro-controller boards simulating a zero-pollution mobile electric vehicle equipped with features such as obstacle avoidance, video surveillance and GPS tracking, and has an on-board local server. The secondary unit consists of a pollution monitor that collects several kinds of data such as temperature, sound level and different gas levels. The pollution monitor uses an Arduino micro-controller board and a combination of different sensors and a Wi-Fi module. The combined data from the primary unit and the secondary unit is sent to the local server. The data from the local server can then be logged/stored on a cloud service for detailed analysis of the data. The initial performance evaluation results are encouraging. This system is a robust, flexible, easily deployable and an eco-friendly solution, in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT), to the ever concerning problem of pollution.},

abstract={This paper presents a non-invasive breath test to monitor the condition of diabetic patients. It is identified as an easier technique and quick diagnoses of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a preventable acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Common diabetic test on patients are done on urinary test and blood ketone test to monitor for diabetes condition. However, those methods are considers as invasive, inconvenient and expensive. Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors. This research is significant where patients can independently monitor their diabetic health and the IoT system can be alerted directly to medial officers in the hospitals.},

abstract={Beginning with the recent availability of wireless medical sensor prototype and growing, the need for E-health care application record databases, we analyze the requirement of a unified communication framework over a fifth generation network. The introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) and latest developments or improvements in E-health, pointed towards the fifth generation (5G) paradigm of health care application and services. This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data. Further, we propose a protocol stack for 5G-CCN WBAN to provide a secure, efficient and reliable E-health application services to meet the required needs of the current IP protocol stack and IoT devices.},

It has far reaching implications in the quality of living. In the modern world where the quality of living has been degraded significantly IoT can certainly play a constructive role in providing better services. In healthcare, there are several occasions such as patient health monitoring, remote observation and emergency proceedings outside the hospital where sensors can play essential roles. The coordinated sensor networks can provide even better services. IoT has the ability to provide all these coordinated services. Narrowband IoT (NBIoT) is an economical and simpler version of IoT which can handle these tasks effectively.

An application is developed on android platform combined with Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor devices. Health of patient will be monitored by sensors and data from sensors will be sent to cloud which can be accessed anytime by the doctor and/or caretaker both in the cloud and application for necessary follow-ups in real time. Findings: In order to find the health of a patient more parameters are needed. But the main parameter for identifying the health of a patient are heart rate and temperatures. More parameters can be added to the system developed. Improvements/Applications: More sensors can be added to the system and the system has many application scenarios such as family health care.},

Modern buildings are increasingly equipped with a wide array of sensors. Distributed and connected sensing represents an untapped opportunity for us to optimize the operation of buildings by reducing energy use and operation costs and improving occupant comfort, health, and productivity. However, distributed and connected sensing in buildings without robust data analytics tools and methods has also become a major problem; more sensors and actuators mean a larger number of components and equipment that can fail and need to be diagnosed and maintained.

abstract={In the last years, the emergence of pervasive connected devices and the development of the cloud computing paradigms brought a revolution in health-care and industrial applications. Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture.},

The data and information are the most important resources of the organization. The security of organization resources is a major problem. In this paper, our contribution is twofold, firstly we investigate and analyze the different security architectures of important organization such as online banking, E-government, higher education sector, E-health, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing etc. Secondly, we propose a universal security framework for an enterprise for the protection of its resources. We divide the security framework into three layers, perimeter security layer, network security layer and internal security layer. With this categorization, we aim to provide an easy and concise view of the design details of an enterprise security architecture.},

abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered a- d relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},

abstract={The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (loT) is quickly becoming the key enabler for the digital transformation of the healthcare industry by offering comprehensive improvements in patient engagements, productivity and risk mitigation. This paradigm shift, while bringing numerous benefits and new opportunities to healthcare organizations, has raised a lot of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.},

abstract={Anomaly detection is important for time-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as healthcare and emergency management. The recent introduction of Fog computing architecture provides an efficient platform for delay sensitive IoT applications. Exploiting the advantages of Fog computing for anomaly detection provides the ability to detect abnormal patterns in an accurate and timely manner. Use of Centralized and Distributed anomaly detection methods suffer from significant latency and energy consumption issues. Hence, we propose a novel anomaly detection method, called Fog-Empowered anomaly detection, by harnessing the processing power of the Fog computing platform and using an efficient hyperellipsoidal clustering algorithm. The end nodes in the Fog computing architecture do not perform any processing or clustering on the data. The Fog layer and the Cloud layer nodes perform the clustering and anomaly detection process, thus helping to achieve anomaly detection in a timely manner. The evaluation using synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach achieves a significant reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to the Distributed and Centralized schemes, while achieving a comparable detection accuracy compared to a Centralized scheme.},

Through our ongoing research project, we propose a system that can positively impact the standard of life for pregnant mothers. Modern day smartphones have proven to be extremely pervasive in developing regions of the world. Most of these smartphones are equipped with hardware that can support biometric monitoring of its user. By taking advantage of the sensors present on smartphones and an accessory biomedical signal acquisition device we intend to unobtrusively acquire vital information about the health status of pregnant women. The acquired data is then processed and classified using signal processing and analysis tools to assist healthcare practitioners evaluate the status of pregnant women remotely. Since most pregnant women in our area of focus already own smartphones, the cost associated with our system is minimal.

abstract={Modern wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices enable the monitoring of vital parameters such as heart or respiratory (RESP) rates, electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals within e-health applications. A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude. Finally, avenues for future research are discussed.},

Hence it is best suited for IoT applications like Smart homes, intelligent transportation systems, health monitoring systems and many more. This paper proposes an architectural design of the Zigbee Transmitter through Verilog HDL. As the transmitter is an integration of various blocks, so each block is simulated and their individual results are presented in this paper. For efficient hardware implementation on FPGA/ASIC, optimization of the design is of paramount importance. This can be done by architectural coding of the design. Hence, the architecture has been simulated and the post route simulation output has been presented in this paper.},

abstract={A counterfeit drug is a medication or pharmaceutical product which is manufactured and made available on the market to deceptively represent its origin, authenticity and effectiveness, etc., and causes serious threats to the health of a patient. Counterfeited medicines have an adverse effect on the public health and cause revenue loss to the legitimate manufacturing organizations. In this paper, we propose a new authentication scheme for medicine anticounterfeiting system in the Internet of Things environment which is used for checking the authenticity of pharmaceutical products (dosage forms). The proposed scheme utilizes the near field communication (NFC) and is suitable for mobile environment, which also provides efficient NFC update phase. The security analysis using the widely accepted real-or-random model proves that the proposed scheme provides the session key security. The proposed scheme also protects other known attacks which are analyzed informally. Furthermore, the formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool shows that the proposed scheme is secure. The scheme is efficient with respect to computation and communication costs, and also it provides additional functionality features when compared to other existing schemes. Finally, for demonstration of the practicality of the scheme, we evaluate it using the broadly accepted NS2 simulation.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), part of the fast emerging Internet of Things will be playing vital role in transforming our lives. Potentially huge number of these sensors will soon be deployed to perform simple to complex tasks such as automatically controlling heat and light in smart homes to guiding autonomous vehicles and missiles. A big challenge in WSN is providing energy. Battery management and maintenance of these sensors can be a prohibitively expensive exercise because of their abundance. Sensors' performance will deteriorate with the remaining energy level and dead sensor nodes will affect the performance of an entire network, especially in multi-hop networks. Improper battery disposal will also cause environmental pollution and health hazardous in the long run. The energy issue can be alleviated by energy harvesting. The ambience has energy in the forms of light, heat, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiations. This energy has to be collected with appropriate transducers, stored reliably and used for wireless data transmission which is typically happens as bursts. The sporadic and unreliable nature of the energy harvesting process as well as characteristics of electronic elements has to be appropriately modeled to design viable energy harvesting WSN.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as telehealth, smart appliances, and smart energy are becoming more common within the home. However, they must compete for bandwidth with traditional applications such as video streaming, video conferencing, and bulk file transfers. Such competition can be detrimental to the IoT applications when home gateways use traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue management. Simply increasing bandwidth between the home gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP), even when possible, provides no guarantee of bandwidth for IoT applications since many traditional applications will consume as much bandwidth as is available. In this paper, we explore whether active queue management (AQM), now being implemented in home gateways, can provide protection for IoT flows. We investigate the effect of different AQM algorithms deployed at the home gateway in scenarios with multiple concurrent application flows. We find that deploying multiqueue FlowQueue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) or the hybrid FlowQueue Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (FQ-PIE) at the home gateway can provide excellent capacity sharing, flow isolation, and good protection in terms of throughput and queuing delays for IoT flows and other applications, which cannot be achieved with traditional FIFO or other single-queue AQMs such as Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE).},

abstract={Given the beneficial role of the serious games (SGs), which has been evaluated and found effective over the last years through large scale pilots, SGs are gradually being considered as new and effective tools in the healthcare domain. Following this evolution, this paper presents the potential value of the interplay between the Internet of Things and the SGs in a twofold approach: SGs consuming heterogeneous information coming from the user's environment (through IoT) as well as SGs as virtual devices providing meaningful information pertaining to the user's progress and physical and cognitive health status. The insights provided in this paper support the augmented personalization and consequently effectiveness of the SGs as part of the users' lifestyle. The paper concludes with the big challenge of the next years which will remain the deep understanding of the SGs information, as well as the semantic representation of it.},

title={Lossless In-Network Processing in WSNs for Domain-Specific Monitoring Applications},

pages={2130-2139},
abstract={Internet of things (IOT) is emerging as sensing paradigms in many domain-specific monitoring applications in smart cities, such as structural health monitoring (SHM) and smart grid monitoring. Due to the large size of the monitoring objects (e.g., civil structure or the power grid), plenty of sensors need to be deployed and organized to be a large scale of multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which tends to have quite high transmission cost. In-network processing is an efficient way to reduce the transmission cost in WSNs. However, implementing in-network processing for above domain-specific monitoring usually requires to losslessly distribute a dedicate domain-specific algorithm into WSNs, which is much different from most existing in-network processing works. This paper conducts a case study of a classic centralized SHM algorithm, i.e., eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and shows how to losslessly and optimally in-network process ERA, especially the typical feature extraction method, i.e., that is singular value decomposition (SVD) therein, in a WSN. Based on whether the intermediate data can be processed together or not by sensor nodes, we respectively implement tree-based in-network processing of SVD and chain-based in-network processing of SVD in WSNs. We prove that using an appropriate shallow light tree as routes for tree-based in-network processing of SVD, can achieve the approximation ratio ${text{1}}+sqrt{2}$ (in terms of transmission cost), while for the chain-based in-network processing of SVD, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms for searching the optimal routes. Extensive simulation results validate the efficiency of these proposed schemes that are customized for SVD-based IOT applications.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is the key enabling technology in the electronic health (e-health) management systems. However, the challenges in secure communication in IoT need to be addressed carefully for large and commercial deployment of e-health applications. Key management is a basic requirement for accomplishing secure IoT smart environments. However, constrained resources in IoT raises real difficulties achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a secure key management and authentication protocol, making use of hybrid cryptography that involves both symmetric and certificate-less public key cryptographic algorithms. In this protocol, the constrained nodes contribute only in the symmetric algorithms. The performance evaluation and comparison results of the proposed protocol show its ability to satisfy the security requirements in IoT e-health environments.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Cognitive networks (CNs) are one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where CNs will play an important role in the future internet in several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based Internet of Things (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.},

Due to the large scale of and the limited host processor computation power in an IoT system, effective security provisioning is shifting from software-based security implementation to hardware-based security implementation in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, FPGA can take over the work of infrastructure components to preserve and protect critical components and minimize the negative impacts on these components. In this paper, we employ Xilinx Zynq-7000 Series System-on-Chip (SoC) ZC706 prototype board to design an IoT device. To defend against threats to FPGA design, we have studied Zynq-ZC706 to (1) encrypt FPGA bitstream to protect the IoT device from bitstream decoding; (2) encrypt system boot image to enhance system security; and (3) ensure the FPGA operates correctly as intended via authentication to avoid spoofing and Trojan Horse attacks.},

abstract={We propose a preferential theme matrix for selecting a problem in carrying out the minor project for 6th semester Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. The matrix comprises of emerging technologies, research areas and the application domains as the parameters. It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data & analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external reco- nition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks are nowadays employed in several applications. Cyber-physical systems, health-care instruments and Internet of Things are using hundreds of smart sensors, which include also processing capability together with sophisticated communication protocols. The presence of faults in these critical applications must be checked during runtime, to detect transient and permanent faults that could seriously affect the entire system dependability and endanger human users. Continuous checking has been proven as inefficient in many cases, due to the low degrees of observability and controllability and to the limited life time of batteries. Even, on-line testing is often unable to report the presence of internal errors, which can remain latent during long times. In this paper, a proposal is presented for improving the on-line testability of the different type of nodes in a WSN, saving energy and tracking error from their origin.},

Medical device hacks are slowly becoming a reality and it becomes more critical than ever to defend and protect these devices from security attacks.

abstract={In recent years, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has already been implemented in numerous application domains, such as smart city, intelligent healthcare assistant, and smart transportation management. Researchers or developers associated with these domains frequently require diverse types of IoT devices to implement or test their IoT related innovations. However, building an IoT-testbed by purchasing these IoT devices in every few months is infeasible considering that most of them will be used only for a small amount of time and will become obsolete with the arrival of an upgraded version of those devices. Instead, a better approach would be rented out the IoT devices in on-demand, just-in-time, and pay for only the time the devices are used basis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose IoTbed - an architecture to deliver a large scale Testbed as a service using the IoT devices located in the users' proximal networks. IoTbed enables testbed providers to build their testbeds in the edge of the network and allows easy and secure access for IoT service providers to run experiments on those testbeds. IoTbed presents an economic model that offers monetary incentives to the device owners for using their devices in the testbed experiments. We posit that such an incentive model will encourage more testbed providers to rent out their smart devices through IoTbed. To demonstrate the feasibility of IoTbed, we implemented a prototype of IoTbed to run on Contiki powered IoT devices and evaluated the performance.},

Leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT), edge and cloud computing technologies, we propose an architecture which is capable of providing cloud based clinical services using human activity data. Such services could supplement the shortage of staff in primary healthcare centers thereby reducing the burden on healthcare service providers. The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients.

abstract={One of the key issues about wireless technologies is their interaction with the human body. The so-called internet of things will comprise many devices that will transmit either around or through the human body. These devices must be tested either in their working medium, when possible, or in the most realistic one. For this purpose, tissue-like phantoms are the best alternative to carry out realistic analyses of the performance of body area networks. In addition, they are the conventional way to certify the compliance of commercial standards by these devices. However, the number of phantoms that work in large bandwidths is limited in literature. This work aims at presenting chemical solutions that will be useful to prepare a variety of wideband tissue phantoms. Besides, the colon was mimicked in two ways, the healthy tissue and the malignant one, taking into account studies that relate changes on the relative permittivity with cancer. They were designed on the basis of acetonitrile in aqueous solutions as described in a previous work. Thus, many scenarios could be developed such as multilayers which imitate parts of the heterogeneous body.},

abstract={Exposure to air pollution poses a significant risk to human health, particularly to urban dwellers. When correlated with individual health outcomes, high resolution information on human mobility and the spatial and temporal distribution of the pollutants can lead to a better understanding of the effects of pollution exposure. People-centric sensing is normally carried out by data sharing through a central cloud server. This system architecture is not designed to serve the ever-growing number of high fidelity connected devices, particularly when crowdsourcing urban data on location and environmental conditions. Here, we outline an architecture for a people-centric and cognitive internet of things (PIoT) environmental sensing platform, which involves closed loops of interactions among people nodes and physical devices as well as servers and recommendations on device connections by cognitive computing. Taking advantage of smart objects and virtual node technology in PIoT, an algorithm to aggregate on-demand user data from smart devices is proposed. A PIoT prototype sensing system is designed and deployed to measure the space-time distribution of particulate matter in air (PM₂ׅ₅), and mobility counts, for quantifying personal exposure to air pollution. A case study of particulate matter PM₂ׅ₅ exposure in New York City is presented, to illustrates the potential application of people-centric measurement system and data analysis.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) changes many sectors of our lives. In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes. The system is flexible and can incorporate more policy rules, professionals, and data classes.},

abstract={Data-driven business processes are gaining popularity among enterprises now-a-days. In many situations, multiple parties would share data towards a common goal if it were possible to simultaneously protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations described in the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics require parties to transfer their raw data to a trusted mediator, who then performs the desired analysis on the global data, and shares the results with the parties. Unfortunately, such a solution does not fit many applications where privacy is a strong concern such as healthcare, finance and the internet-of-things. Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy, in this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving multi-party analytics, where the goal is to enable analytics on multi-party data without compromising the data privacy of each individual party. We propose a secure gradient descent algorithm that enables analytics on data that is arbitrarily partitioned among multiple parties. The proposed algorithm is generic and applies to a wide class of machine learning problems. We demonstrate our solution for a popular use-case (i.e., regression), and evaluate the performance of the proposed secure solution in terms of accuracy, latency and communication cost. We also perform a scalability analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution as the data size and the number of parties increase.},

abstract={Proactive monitoring of one's health could avoid serious diseases as well as better maintain the individual's well-being. In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.},

abstract={Advances in wireless sensor technologies and MEMS have made it possible to automatically monitor the health status of dairy cows using Internet of things (IoT) and wireless body area networks. Since on-cow measuring devices are energy constrained, a proper characterisation of the off-body wireless channel between the on-cow sensor nodes and the back-end base station is required for an optimised deployment of these networks in barns. In this Letter, the long range (LoRa) off-body wireless channel has been characterised at 868 MHz, a typical IoT frequency. Both path loss and temporal fading were investigated using LoRa motes. Based on this characterisation, network planning and energy consumption optimisation of the on-body nodes could be performed, which enables the deployment of reliable dairy cow monitoring systems.},

IoT architectures are distributed and often based on constrained devices, which make challenging the task of introducing security mechanisms, in particular those requiring dynamic policy evaluation. In this paper we present UCIoT (Usage Control in IoT), a fault tolerant and adaptable framework for the enforcement of usage control policies in IoT environments. UCIoT brings the functionalities of a U-XACMLbased usage control framework on a decentralized, distributed and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture. In the present work, we describe an application of UCIoT in a Smart-Home environment, presenting also two possible use cases where usage control is exploited to implement a policy for energy saving and a policy for safety.

The yoking-proof scheme addresses this issue. However, all existing yoking-proof schemes require two or more rounds communication to generate the yoking-proof. In this paper, we investigate the design of one-round yoking-proof schemes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) to confirm the coexistence of the RFID tag pair, we propose a one-round offline yoking-proof scheme with privacy protection. (2) We define a privacy model of the yoking-proof scheme and enhance Moriyama's security model for the yoking-proof scheme. The security and the privacy of the proposed scheme are proved under our models. (3) We further extend the yoking-proof scheme for the coexistence of m RFID tags, where m>2. The extended scheme maintains one-round. In addition, the proposed technique has efficiency advantage, compared with previous work.},

pages={16441-16458},
abstract={In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm.},

abstract={Advances in computation, sensing, and networking have led to interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS). Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the health-care sector through remote, continuous, and non-invasive monitoring of patients. However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.},

abstract={Different application domains are challenging the still immature access control mechanisms currently used to authenticate and to authorize system-on-chip architectures to services deployed locally or in the cloud. These domains include Internet of Things, Smart Places or Industry 4.0 where different kinds of devices and objects, often poorly physically protected, low-cost and energy-constrained, interact with different kinds of services through lightweight communication protocols. These protocols usually guarantee basic data confidentiality and integrity, securing communication channels using cryptography, but there are still important challenges related to authentication and authorization. This work proposes a new system-to-service authentication and authorization mechanism based on the combination of a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and two tokens (one devoted to authentication and the other devoted to authorization), capable of working over HTTP or COAP relying on federated schemes and adapted to the specific requirements of this kind of environments. The new mechanism is validated and its efficiency and security are evaluated using a real healthcare case study.},

abstract={In recent years, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has largely been supported by the parallel development of the Cloud computing capacities. Cloud computing offered elastic and on-demand computing power able to host and support crucial IoT functions.

To tackle those problems, the research community has recently turned to Fog Computing. In this paper, we present CIoud4IoT, a platform able to perform horizontal (roaming) and vertical (offloading) migration of IoT functions. We implement our demonstration using a Kubernetes cIuster organised in three tiers: Cloud, Edge and IoT gateways. Our first use cases shows how IoT function roaming can be used in the context of health care data exploitation. The second use case exploits the IoT offloading capacity of our platform to optimize the remote diagnostic of mechanical engines.},

abstract={Building large-scale low-power Internet of Things (IoT) systems remains a challenge, as these systems have to meet the requirements of reliability, robustness, and energy-efficiency while running on resource-restricted microcontrollers without memory protection. In this paper we present the case study of IoT in SPHERE (Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in a Residential Environment), a project with the objective to develop a multipurpose, multi-modal sensor platform for monitoring people's health inside their homes. Atypically for academic projects, in 2017 the SPHERE software is going to be deployed in a 100-home study in volunteer homes, therefore it has to satisfy many real-world requirements. We discuss the requirements for IoT networking in this project, the IoT architecture (built on top of Contiki OS), software engineering challenges and lessons learned, as well as some of the general aspects that still make embedded low-power IoT software development difficult.},

abstract={Enormous amounts of data are growing because of the continuous and increasing use of smart devices which connect, collect, exchange and transfer these large amounts of data. With the convergence of new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (CC) many sectors are benefited. Our research has to do with Big Data Delivery over the IoT. Specifically, in our research we are trying to investigate new communication protocols, new security mechanisms, new efficient, faster, safer, and energy efficient solutions and algorithms for healthcare systems (hospital buildings, rooms, etc.). The aim of our research is to create and propose suitable algorithms for efficient transmission of health big data, for management issues, for the analysis of IoT data and for security solutions. Our current position is the experimentation with IoT devices, IoT health data, big data analytics, and healthcare systems. In this paper we present some of the challenges and the issues of Big Data. We also present work that has been done by other researchers. Finally, is presented an open source tool for experimentation, so that we can view the system in detail. Such a tool is the Cooja emulator which is part of the Contiki OS, and is presented also in this paper. As future work we manage to implement such a healthcare system, provide more efficient algorithms, and investigate new protocols for more efficient and secure transmissions of the sensitive health data. By these improvements we are going to provide better healthcare and faster diagnosis to everybody.},

abstract={The Internet Of Things (IoT) is poised to make substantial inroads in all aspects of modern life before the end of this decade, including applications in smart grids, smart cities, transportation, crowdsensing, e-health, ambient assisted living, and home automation, to list just a few. Although it is recognized that IoTSec mechanisms and principles are needed across the entire IoT ecosystem, many of the intrinsic features of IoT systems make the IoT vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches. Firms wonder if the mechanisms required to protect the users and the data are ready for "prime time", especially in the e-health arena. The field of big data as related to security event processing, is relatively new, especially in the context of IoT, challenges include but are not limited to capture, transmission, analysis and curation of the data. This article provides a novel IoT protocol architecture and examines security tools and techniques that can be leveraged as part of the deployment of IoT, these mechanisms are particularly important in e-health and assisted living applications.},

abstract={Wearable and connected health is a dominant field in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been widely used for enabling many connected health applications in diverse areas including: activity recognition, elder care, sports, and rehabilitation. Although the number of transistors in an integrated circuit follows Moore's law, it does not apply to batteries. Thus, in BSNs, the sensor node's compact size means it has a strict energy constraint. At the same time, body sensor nodes have sensing requirements that should provide an acceptable level of data fidelity in order to accurately infer the amount and type of activity. This paper investigates the energy challenges associated with combining MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and ball-tube motion detectors for BSNs. We examine multiple scenarios using these sensor types for body motion characterization. We then investigate the feasibility of these technologies along with collaborative sensing with the aim of reducing overall energy consumption. We conducted experiments examining sedentary (i.e. no movement) and non-sedentary activities. Our results show the possibility of 67 % reduction in energy consumption during the sedentary periods only, while maintaining the required level of data fidelity for inferring motion types.},

abstract={Smart textile and wearable technologies will form an integral part of Internet of Things ecologies, including those implemented in mental health service environments. Smart textiles were developed and provided to users who were asked to discuss their feelings whilst holding/interacting with a smart textile during a walk. In the study discussed, respondents spoke aloud while using prototype handheld smart textiles with wireless capability, soft switches and accelerometers. Voice recordings were collected and transformed into verbal transcripts which were comparatively analysed to assess their validity for understanding individuals' emotional states in Internet of Things-enabled mental health service design. This paper reports on the talk aloud protocol, and the creation of a data analytics model for semantically analysing the transcripts in order to identify the `anxious' from the `not so anxious' participants. The model comprises of two main parts: Latent Semantic Analysis, for semantically analysing the transcripts; and the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm to naturally place the data into the two groups. The analysis revealed significant differences between the vocabulary used by the `anxious' and `not so anxious' participants. Finally, we demonstrate how the voice recorded data can help understand the patterns detected in accelerometer data collected from the smart textiles, using the data of one participant. This approach further provides an understanding of how smart textile objects can be utilised to communicate participant reactions to environments and situations as part of a Person-Centred approach to smart textile and service design development with mental health service providers.},

abstract={As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a myriad of devices and services that interact to build complex distributed applications. Interoperability and standardization are imperative for the realization of this vision. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications standards can be the middleware that glues together the IoT. However, standards are highly complex and require a large amount of interpretation, deployments are currently scarce, and performance evaluations simplistic or speculative. In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications. Moreover, we observe that latencies between a smartphone GW and cloud hosted services vary largely depending on the user mobility, and on the promotion delay of the used wireless network.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension and expansion of the Internet which is extensively deployed in the healthcare field. With the proliferation of Personal Health Devices (PHDs), there is a significant incompatibility issue where devices use special data transfer protocols and can only communicate with special healthcare providers from the same manufacturer, thus interoperability and network energy consumption features become important issues. In this paper, we design and implement an integration architecture of ISO 11073 DIM with FHIR resources using CoAP to exchange health information between personal health devices and healthcare providers for solving communication consumption issues and standardization issues. We design and implement an ISO/IEEE 11073 translator gateway for device standardization and an ISO/IEEE 11073/FHIR translator gateway for Electronic Health Record (EHR) standardization. In addition, we use CoAP as data transfer protocol. An android application that is developed acts as a health manager for healthcare consumers. We used SpO2 as personal health device to measure and deliver the health data to test this architecture.},

One of the main challenges for architecting such control and diagnostics systems is their restrictive performance requirements, which directly impact the architecture and subsequent detailed designs. This paper presents a case study on the conceptual architecture design in such an environment, and co-develops the architecture and the domain solution to improve prototyping rapidness. First, on applying systems thinking and technologies, during architecting, we include the tasks of meeting both functional and performance requirements especially with respect to analytics, in a single architecture description framework. Second, we study a domain-specific issue, where un-attempted methods must be researched, and provide a solution that re-uses existing system elements, through which the mutual impacts between the information from both architecture and domain solutions are shown. Practical and important issues including benefits, standards, and implementations are also explored as part of the required tasks for architecting. Results including architecture designs and empirical performance research are illustrated, to indicate a systematic design process for systems in a PHM environment.},

abstract={Digital world has produced efficiencies, new innovative products, and close customer relationships globally by the effective use of mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), social media, analytics and cloud technology to generate models for better decisions. Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.},

Thus, it is important to inform the person about his unhealthy life style and even alarm him/her before any acute condition occurs. To detect the stress beforehand we have used heart beat rate as one of the parameters.

abstract={Regarded as one of the future enabling technologies of the Internet of Things at the biological and nanoscale domains, Molecular Communication (MC) promises to enable applications in healthcare, environmental protection, and bioremediation, amongst others. Since MC is directly inspired by communication processes in biological cells, the engineering of biological circuits through cells' genetic code manipulation, which enables access to the cells' information processing abilities, is a candidate technology for the future realization of MC components. In this paper, inspired by previous research on channel coding schemes for MC and biological circuits for cell communications, a joint encoder and modulator design is proposed for the transmission of cellular information through signaling molecules. In particular, the information encoding and modulation are based on a binary parity check scheme, and they are implemented by interconnecting biological circuit components based on gene expression and mass action reactions. Each component is mathematically modeled and tuned according to the desired output. The implementation of the biological circuit in a simulation environment is then presented along with the corresponding numerical results, which validate the proposed design by showing agreement with an ideal encoding and modulator scheme.},

Thus, the patient treatment can be performed in more efficient ways compared with traditional methods. Secure identification is a key system requirement for patients to acquire these health related services. Fast and convenient identification is important in the case of critical and elderly or disabled patients who required frequent health services. In this paper, we are presenting concept of the Naked environment where patients can get health services from smart and intelligent surroundings of hospital without using explicit gadgets. Patients would have direct interaction with the environment and get identified through it. We propose a biometric based authentication scheme for the Naked hospital environment that also protects the patients identity privacy. In addition, we show that this authentication scheme can resist various well known attacks such as insider attacks, replay attacks and identity privacy among others.},

abstract={Internet-connected embedded systems have limited capabilities to defend themselves against remote hacking attacks. The potential effects of such attacks, however, can have a significant impact in the context of the Internet of Things, industrial control systems, smart health systems, etc. Embedded systems cannot effectively utilize existing software-based protection mechanisms due to limited processing capabilities and energy resources. We propose a novel hardware-based monitoring technique that can detect if the embedded operating system or any running application deviates from the originally programmed behavior due to an attack. We present an FPGA-based prototype implementation that shows the effectiveness of such a security approach.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},

abstract={With the growth of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), network monitoring of the global infrastructure will continue to expand, as cybersecurity will become of primary importance. Current network monitoring approaches, particularly those that are agent-based, are proprietary, costly, and may not scale. This paper proposes a lightweight, scalable agentless system which can be configured, setup, and begin monitoring network health within minutes. The architecture utilizes a polling script to query Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) demon for metrics, Prometheus Time Series Database instances for storage, and a Grafana Dashboard for metric presentation and alerting. The system design removes the learning curve necessary for most open source monitoring systems, while still providing similar metrics. The approach demonstrated here shows the ease and security with which specific site network monitoring can be deployed in a cloud configuration. Data from the network monitoring can be forwarded to a central analysis site for assessment and correlation. The proposed system is scalable, extensible for use in most cloud hosting environments, and provides network managers with direct control over the monitoring process and dashboard.},

abstract={The Internet is populated with billions of electronic gadgets that have become a part of our fabric. Internet of Things is gaining popularity in at most all applications from smart buildings, intelligent transportation, healthcare and defence. IoT is a many vision one paradigm technology. One of the many visions of IoT is to make `Things' social. Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a young paradigm that integrates IoT and Social networking principles where Things are not only autonomous and smarter but also socially conscious. The authors propose a trust management scheme to facilitate trustworthy automatic decision making based on behaviour of objects. The authors use SIoT Trust metrics namely direct trust, centrality, community interest, Cooperativeness, Service Score to compute Trustworthiness among objects. The Expected trust and periodic trust updates evidently identify the presence of `on off' selective forwarding attacks. The authors demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme with other existing trust management schemes in the literature.},

abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as sensors have been actively used in 'fogs' to provide critical data during e.g., disaster response scenarios or in-home healthcare. Since IoT devices typically operate in resource-constrained computing environments at the network-edge, data transfer performance to the cloud as well as end-to-end security have to be robust and customizable. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a middleware featuring "intermittent" and "flexible" end-to-end security for cloud-fog communications. Intermittent security copes with unreliable network connections, and flexibility is achieved through security configurations that are tailored to application needs. Our experiment results show how our middleware that leverages static pre-shared keys forms a promising solution for delivering light-weight, fast and resource-aware security for a variety of IoT-based applications.},

abstract={The spry maturation of Internet of Things (IoT) has paved way to the rapid development of numerous sectors and these have been envisioned in; connected transport, smart cities, connected homes, connected healthcare, etc. IoT is a technology that connects "things" that are embedded with sensors, actuators and network connectivity to collect and exchange the data to the internet. The ability of IoT that offers distinct technologies for a small constrained device to collect and deliver messages across sophisticated networks leaves room for more exploration. Zeroing down to the healthcare sector, a couple of Personal Health Devices (PHDs) have been developed to collect and share information across the internet. One Machine to Machine (oneM2M), ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD are some of the healthcare standards that have been developed have been developed to deal with the issue of interoperability in the IoT. In this paper we design and implement an interoperable messaging system that is based on international standards for IoT healthcare services. Standard IoT protocols; Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are some of the protocols that were designed to be used in an IoT environment. We designed and implemented a message system using CoAP following international standards for IoT healthcare services. This is due to better performance that CoAP offers in a constrained environment over other protocols. The paper further analyses and evaluates a comparative performance of number of packets transmitted in a transaction and packet loss rate number during transmission between the designed system and existing messaging system that uses MQTT.},

abstract={A better lifestyle starts with a healthy heart. Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers. In addition, the system can represent the collected data in useful ways, perform automatic decision making and provide many advanced services such as real-time notifications for immediate attention.},

One really important parameter is the quality of the air since it significantly influences comfort and health. Fluctuation Enhanced Sensing (FES) is a promising method to increase the selectivity and sensitivity of the sensors, however, most of the current implementations are not optimized for energy efficient embedded systems. In our current publication we will present a complete wireless sensor node system based on Wi-Fi communication. We describe in detail how can the data processing be shared between the sensor nodes and the server in order to provide a highly reliable and responsive system while minimizing energy consumption. We believe that the framework we built is a significant step that makes it possible for fluctuation based sensing methods to be used in everyday life. Beyond gas sensing, our method can be used in further noise diagnostic based applications and seamlessly fits into the concept of IoT.},

abstract={The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought new security requirements in terms of communication services with respect to data transmitted in mobile networks. Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks. We evaluated both protocols through a specific e-health scenario. Tests revealed the usage of mobile networks increases response time and overhead of both protocols, on average, when compared to traditional networks.},

abstract={The domain of Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding beyond research, and becoming a major industrial market with such stakeholders as major manufacturers of chips and connected entities (i.e., things), and fast-growing operators of wide-area networks. Importantly, this emerging domain is driven by applications that leverage an IoT infrastructure to provide users with innovative, high-value services. IoT infrastructures range from small scale (e.g., homes and personal health) to large scale (e.g., cities and transportation systems). In this paper, we argue that there is a continuum between orchestrating connected entities in the small and in the large. We propose a unified approach to application development, which covers this spectrum. To do so, we examine the requirements for orchestrating connected entities and address them with domainspecific design concepts. We then show how to map these design concepts into dedicated programming patterns and runtime mechanisms. Our work revolves around domain-specific concepts and notations, integrated into a tool-based design methodology and dedicated to develop IoT applications. We have applied our work across a spectrum of infrastructure sizes, ranging from an automated pilot in avionics, to an assisted living platform for the home of seniors, to a parking management system in a smart city.},

abstract={We are witnessing a technological revolution with a broad impact ranging from daily life (e.g., personalized medicine and education) to industry (e.g., data-driven healthcare, commerce, agriculture, and mining). At the core of this transformation lies "data". This transformation is facilitated by embedded devices, collectively known as Internet of Things (IoT), which produce real-time feeds of sensor data which are collected and processed to produce a dynamic physical model used for optimized real-time decision making. At the infrastructure level, there is a need to develop a scalable architecture for processing massive volumes of present and historical data at an unprecedented velocity to support the IoT paradigm. To cope with such extreme scale, we argue for the need to revisit the hardware and software co-design landscape in light of two key technological advancements. First is the virtualization of computation and storage over highly distributed data centers spanning across continents. Second is the emergence of a variety of specialized hardware accelerators that complement traditional general-purpose processors. Further efforts are required to unify these two trends in order to harness the power of big data. In this paper, we present a formulation and characterization of the hardware acceleration landscape geared towards real-time analytics in the cloud. Our goal is to assist both researchers and practitioners navigating the newly revived field of software and hardware co-design for building next generation distributed systems. We further present a case study to explore software and hardware interplay for designing distributed real-time stream processing.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we interact with our environment in domains as diverse as health, transportation, office buildings and our homes. In smart building environments, information captured about the building and its inhabitants will aid in development of services that improve productivity, comfort, social interactions, safety, energy savings and more. However, by collecting and sharing information about building's inhabitants and their activities, these services also open the door to privacy risks. In this paper, we introduce a framework where IoT Assistants capture and manage the privacy preferences of their users and communicate them to privacy-aware smart buildings, which enforce them when collecting user data or sharing it with building services. We outline elements necessary to support such interactions and also discuss important privacy policy attributes that need to be captured. This includes looking at attributes necessary to describe - (1) the data collection and sharing practices associated with deployed sensors and services in smart buildings as well as (2) the privacy preferences to help users manage their privacy in such environments.},

abstract={Current prospects of Internet of Things (IoT) is very strong for healthcare sector. It is also very popular due to its ability for sensing and measurements. In the low energy form, we have narrowband IoT (NBIoT). It is preferred in healthcare sector due to its low energy requirements. There are several proposals for the implementation of NBIoT in the healthcare sector. NBIoT has been standardized and it has perfect compatibility with cellular platforms such as LTE. Therefore in the recent times, NBIoT is a good choice for healthcare related applications. However, the security measures and other system related challenges are the biggest threats for NBIoT. If these issues and challenges are handled properly it can be one of the most suitable and popular choices for the low power wide area implementations of healthcare. In this article, we present these main issues and challenges found in the NBIoT regime right now. We also present some potential solutions to handle these problems.},

abstract={Wearable Internet-of-Things (WIoT) environments have demonstrated great potential in a broad range of applications in healthcare and well-being. Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements. We conclude the paper with a list of insights into what capabilities constrained WIoT platforms should provide developers so as to make the inclusion of data-driven security primitives in such systems.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that interconnects billions of devices, such as cameras, sensors, RFIDs, smart phones, wearable devices, ODBII dongles, etc. Federations of such IoT devices (or things) provides the information needed to solve many important problems that have been too difficult to harness before. Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure. An analysis of the experimental results that illustrate the unconstrained scalability of our technique concludes the paper.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing a huge hype these days, thanks to the increasing capabilities of embedded devices that enable their adoption in new fields of application (e.g. Wireless Sensor Networks, Connected Cars, Health Care, etc.). On the one hand, this is leading to an increasing adoption of multi-tenancy solutions for Cloud and Fog Computing, to analyze and store the data produced. On the other hand, power consumption has become a major concern for almost every digital system, from the smallest embedded circuits to the biggest computer clusters, with all the shades in between. Fine-grain control mechanisms are then needed to cap power consumption at each level of the stack, still guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLA) to the hosted applications. In this work, we propose DockerCap, a software-level power capping orchestrator for Docker containers that follows an Observe-Decide-Act loop structure: this allows to quickly react to changes that impact on the power consumption by managing resources of each container at run-time, to ensure the desired power cap. We show how we are able to obtain results comparable with the state of the art power capping solution provided by Intel RAPL, still being able to tune the performances of the containers and even guarantee SLA constraints.},

abstract={Recent hardware developments have made it possible for the Internet of Things (IoT) to be built. A wide variety of industry sectors, including manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, transportation, and healthcare are actively seeking to incorporate IoT technologies in their operations. The increased connectivity and data sharing that give IoT systems their advantages also increase their vulnerability to attack. In this study, the authors explore the automated generation of attacks using genetic programming (GP), so that defences can be tested objectively in advance of deployment. In the authors' system, the GP-generated attackers targeted publish-subscribe communications within a wireless sensor networks that was protected by an artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS) taken from the literature. The GP attackers successfully suppressed more legitimate messages than the hand-coded attack used originally to test the IDS, whilst reducing the likelihood of detection. Based on the results, it was possible to reconfigure the IDS to improve its performance. Whilst the experiments were focussed on establishing a proof-of-principle rather than a turnkey solution, they indicate that GP-generated attackers have the potential to improve the protection of systems with large attack surfaces, in a way that is complementary to traditional testing and certification.},

The integration of information technology to the electric grid system is expected to address many shortcomings of the current and traditional electrical grids that have resulted in Smart Grid which is gaining lot of interest and momentum. In Smart Grid, Power Distribution is one part which requires monitoring and control. Lot of technologies and have been applied in Smart grid towards sensing and action. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is very well proven within the substation region. There has been very less monitoring done on the distribution side due to the geographical distribution. Currently, Internet of Things has paved way for connecting huge number of devices to the Internet which would be very much effective and beneficial for power distribution and Automation. So accordingly, an IoT based SCADA integrated with Fog for Distribution Automation system has been proposed which takes care of the consumer utilization, outage management, power quality control and pole transformer health. This is supported by fog computing which does real-time streaming analytics. This helps in reducing the internet bandwidth and latency for immediate control action.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bridge the gap between the physical and the cyber world to allow a deeper understanding of user preferences and behaviors. The interactions and relations between users and things need of an effective and efficient recommendation approaches to better meet users interests. Suggesting useful things in IoT environment is a very important task for many applications such as urban computing, smart cities, health care, etc., and it needs to be widely investigated. The goal of recommendation systems is to produce a set of significant suggestions for a user with given characteristics. In this paper, a multi-agent algorithm that, by exploiting of a decentralized and self organizing strategy, builds a distributed recommendation system in IoT environment, is proposed. Things are represented through bit vectors, the thing descriptors, obtained through a locality preserving hash function that maps similar things into similar bit vectors. Cyber agents manage the thing descriptors and exchange them on the basis of ad-hoc probability functions. The outcome is the emergence of an organized overlay-network of cyber agents that allows to obtain an efficient things recommender system. Preliminaries results confirm the validity of the approach.},

abstract={Environment, health, and safety (EHS) regulations require companies to frequently inspect their infrastructure and machinery equipment as well as to monitor their operations with respect to regulation compliance. When problems are discovered effective measures need to be determined and completed. This involves human-lead tasks that like compliance management tasks in general need to be completed carefully and reliably. The adoption of "Internet-of-Things" (IoT) technologies will transform today's prevailing factory automation to a new level of automation with unprecedented possibilities. Our research targets to investigate these possibilities in order to develop next-generation compliance management systems. Unlike today's compliance management systems, these systems are expected to offer automation capabilities and smart assistance for compliance managers. The article introduces a conceptual framework for a corresponding system that makes use of IoT-enabled heterogeneous multi-monitoring data. The system uses data from a diverse set of classical monitoring devices and from business information systems. Through a rule-based approach the users can obtain compliance status information and advice for compliance enforcement actions. The framework is exemplified by describing typical monitoring data and decision rules.},

Modern building has several monitoring and control systems which should cooperate together to achieve energy saving while keeping indoor comfort and healthy environment. The overall building management systems (BMS) provides an integrated way to gather data from the building and issue control commands to the installed technology. The parameters that are monitored in modern buildings are not only temperature and humidity but todays buildings monitor also concentration values of CO2 or volatile organic compounds (VOC). The experience from last decades shows necessity to monitor also the structure of the building. Renewable materials (wood) are today often used for building construction. This material is quite sensitive to environmental factors like humidity and the environment has to be monitored in order to avoid structural health problems in future. Specially timber when exposed to humidity or moisture can degrade quite quickly and can lose load capacity. Modern communication technologies allows installation of many sensors directly into the structure which allows continuous monitoring of the building construction as well as the indoor climate in the building. Internet of Things (IoT) allows new communication technologies providing low cost, low power sensor application within smart city sector.},

abstract={Internet of Things is a growing technology, developing in multiple fields, from smart homes to health and industries. From a technological perspective, it enables the development of new protocols and scenarios, since the standard network protocol suite cannot face the growing number of connected devices and data transmitted. This paper aims to present several standardized protocols, at different networking levels, developed especially for embedded devices with low memory, low processing power and low data rate. We also propose a smart home scenario that uses only standardized IoT protocols.},

abstract={Recently, various types of medical applications of electromagnetic waves have widely been investigated and reported. Typical recent medical applications include: (1) Information / Wireless power transfer: - Wearable or implantable vital data sensor / monitor - Wireless telemedicine / Mobile health system using IoT (Internet of Things) - Wireless capsule endoscopy (2) Diagnosis: - High intensity MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) - Microwave CT (Computed Tomography) for cancer detection - Wireless sleep monitor / ECG (electrocardiogram) monitor (3) Treatment: - Thermal therapy (hyperthermia, ablation, etc) - Wireless brain stimulator - Surgical device (coagulation device, microwave knife, etc) In this presentation, some practical medical applications of electromagnetic waves are introduced. Firstly, a wearable dual-mode antenna for vital data monitoring systems is presented. A key technology for the antenna is body-centric wireless communications. Secondly, an X-band antenna for a microwave sleep monitor is demonstrated with human-body phantom experiments. A “dynamic” phantom played an important role for the study. Thirdly, a coaxial-slot antenna and an array applicator composed of several coaxial-slot antennas for minimally invasive microwave thermal therapy are overviewed. A few results of actual clinical trials by use of coaxial-slot antennas are demonstrated from a technical point of view. Finally, a few different types of surgical devices using high power microwave energy are introduced. Heating characteristics of such microwave surgical devices are evaluated by numerical calculation as well as experiments using phantoms, meat and animals. In addition, some future works are briefly discussed.},

abstract={The advances and fast spread of mobile devices and technologies, we witness today, have extended its advantages over medical and health practice supported by mobile devices, giving rise to the growing research of Internet of Things (IoT), especially the e-Health field. The features provided by mobile technologies revealed to be of major importance when we consider the continuous aging of population and the consequent increase of its debilities. In addition to the increase of lifetime span of population, also the increase of health risks and their locomotive impairments increases, requiring a close monitoring and continuous evaluation. Such monitoring should be as non-invasive as possible, in order not to compromise the mobility and the day-to-day activities of citizens. Therefore, we present the development of a non-invasive optical fiber sensor architecture adaptable to a shoe sole for plantar pressure remote monitoring, which is suitable to be integrated in an IoT e-Health solution to monitor the wellbeing of individuals. The paper explores the production of the optical fiber sensor multiplexed network (using Fiber Bragg Gratings) to monitor the foot plantar pressure distribution during gait (walking movement). From the acquired gait data, it is possible to infer health conditions of the patient’s foot and spine posture. To guarantee the patients mobility, the proposed system consists of an optical fiber sensor network integrated with a wireless transceiver to enable efficient ubiquitous monitoring of patients. The paper shows the calibration and measurement results, which reflect the accuracy of the proposed system, under normal walking in controlled area.},

The solution targets delay-tolerant monitoring e-Health applications, with optional ultra-low latency communications for emergencies. The proposed networking architecture supports user mobile devices acting as small-cells with caching capabilities, for later transmission, when efficient high data rate communication conditions exist. The solution supports immediate high data-rate low-latency transmission for emergency situations.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technological paradigm that can connect things from various fields through the Internet. For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.},

abstract={The Internet of things (IoT) is revolutionizing the management and control of automated systems leading to a paradigm shift in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, health care, transportation, etc. The IoT technology is also envisioned to play an important role in improving the effectiveness of military operations in battlefields. The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to the battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, and the susceptibility of devices to cyber and physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and the information dissemination in the presence of adversaries. This work aims to build the theoretical foundations of designing secure and reconfigurable IoBT networks. Leveraging the theories of stochastic geometry and mathematical epidemiology, we develop an integrated framework to study the communication of mission-critical data among different types of network devices and consequently design the network in a cost effective manner.},

pages={441-446},
abstract={As IoT (Internet-of-things) technologies grow rapidly for emerging applications such as smart living and health care, reducing power consumption in battery-based IoT devices becomes an important issue. An IoT device is a kind of real-time systems, of which power-savings have been widely studied in terms of processor's dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. However, recent research has shown that memory subsystems are getting reached to a significant portion of power consumption in such systems. In this paper, we show that power consumption of real-time systems can be further reduced by combining voltage/frequency scaling with task allocation in hybrid memory. If a task set is schedulable in a low voltage mode of a processor, we can expect that the task set will still be schedulable even with slow memory. By considering this, we adopt non-volatile memory technologies that consume less power than DRAM but provide relatively slow access latency. Our aim is to allocate tasks in non-volatile memory if it does not violate the deadline constraint of real-time tasks, thereby reducing the power consumption of the system further. To do so, we incorporate the memory allocation problem into the problem model of processor's voltage scaling, and evaluate the effectiveness of the combined approach.},

abstract={The internet of things (IoT), which is known as one of the key enabling technologies of smart cities, generally refers to the network of smart objects, which are embedded with sensing, computing, networking, and actuating capabilities that all together enable them to collect and exchange data. The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules. Experimental results have shown that the RealAlert scheme can accurately assess the trust of the sensor nodes as well as data in IoT.},

It may cause negative consequences for patients. Sometimes it results to severe impact on their health. This paper presents the design and implementation of “eMedicare” for those who take medications without continuous professional supervision. Electronic dispensing systems are eHealth drug storage devices that electronically dispense medications in a programmed fashion and track medication use. eMedicare acts as watchdog for medication usage. eMedicare can track the missed medications doses. It notifies the patients through beating an alarm, or through a phone call or updating data on the server. Live data is updated in the server for each dose at the scheduled time with help of Internet of Things (IoT)[3]. Sometimes even after the alarm, if the patients did not take any medicines then it will alert the care takers/ nursing staff through sending messages to server or making phone calls.

abstract={Demand for cheaper and more functional sensors continues to rise in an era when data can be used to improve health, safety, and efficiency in daily lives. In this paper, we present a fully printed sensor capable of noninvasive material thickness detection. By applying an oscillating signal between two millimeter-scale electrodes, the fringing electric field is measurably perturbed by a material placed directly on top of the electrodes, leading to a linearly varying capacitance with change in the material's thickness. We simulate this electric field perturbation and experimentally demonstrate the linear correlation between capacitance and overlying material thickness. Various parameters, from sensor size and structure to substrate and ink materials, are studied to optimize the performance of the printed sensors. Sensors made of metallic carbon nano-tube ink yield the best sensitivity, exhibiting a capacitance change of 26 fF per mm thickness of rubber-ten times more sensitive than devices composed of silver nanoparticle ink. Finally, we demonstrate an effective application of the sensors in automobile tires. By applying the sensors directly beneath the tread (within the tire), mm changes in the tread depth are able to be detected in a 99% confidence interval. These findings provide a straightforward, low-cost approach for monitoring mm changes in material thickness using noninvasive, printed sensors applicable to innumerable Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.},

abstract={A reliable wireless sensor network (WSN) is defined as a network that functions satisfactorily, in terms of both its coverage and connectivity to the sink(s), throughout its intended mission time. Deploying reliable WSNs is especially important for critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as industrial, structural health-monitoring, and military applications. In such applications, failure of the WSN to carry out its required tasks can have serious effects, and hence, cannot be tolerated. However, the deployment of reliable WSNs is a challenging problem. This is primarily attributed to the fact that sensor nodes are subject to random failures due to different factors, such as hardware failures, battery depletion, harsh environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, the problem of deploying a WSN with a specified minimum level of reliability at a minimum deployment cost is addressed. This problem is coined the minimum cost reliability constrained sensor node deployment problem (MCRC-SDP). The MCRC-SDP is proved to be an NP-Complete. An ant colony optimization algorithm coupled with a local search heuristic is proposed as a solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding high-quality solutions to the problem.},

abstract={Internet of Things has been widely applied in everyday life, ranging from transportation, healthcare, to smart homes. As most IoT devices carry constrained resources and limited storage capacity, sensing data need to be transmitted to and stored at resource-rich platforms, such as a cloud. IoT applications retrieve sensing data from the cloud for analysis and decision-making purposes. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the sensing data is essential for the correctness and safety of IoT applications. We summarize the new challenges of the IoT data communication framework with authenticity and integrity and argue that existing solutions cannot be easily adopted. We present two solutions, called Dynamic Tree Chaining (DTC) and Geometric Star Chaining (GSC) that provide authenticity, integrity, sampling uniformity, system efficiency, and application flexibility to IoT data communication. Extensive simulations and prototype emulation experiments driven by real IoT data show that the proposed system is more efficient than alternative solutions in terms of time and space.},

abstract={The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as smart-bulbs, smoke-alarms, webcams, and health-monitoring devices, is accompanied by escalating threats of attacks that can seriously compromise household and personal safety. Recent works have advocated the use of network-level solutions to detect and prevent attacks on smart-home IoT devices. In this paper we undertake a deeper exploration of network-level security solutions for IoT, by comparing flow-based monitoring with packet-based monitoring approaches. We conduct experiments with real attacks on real IoT devices to validate our flow-based security solution, and use the collected traces as input to simulations to compare its processing performance against a packet-based solution. Our results show that flow-based monitoring can achieve most of the security benefits of packet-based monitoring, but at dramatically reduced processing costs. Our study informs the design of future smart-home network-level security solutions.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel signal quality-aware Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry system for continuous cardiac health monitoring applications. The proposed quality-aware ECG monitoring system consists of three modules: 1) ECG signal sensing module; 2) automated signal quality assessment (SQA) module; and 3) signal-quality aware (SQAw) ECG analysis and transmission module. The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches. This paper further shows that the transmission of acceptable quality of ECG signals can significantly improve the battery lifetime of IoT-enabled devices. The proposed quality-aware IoT paradigm has great potential for assessing clinical acceptability of ECG signals in improvement of accuracy and reliability of unsupervised diagnosis system.},

abstract={There are many recent revolutionary advances in information technology that include: wireless communication, the spread of mobile devices, and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). IoT will have an important role in connecting almost everything (mobile devices, cameras, home appliances, healthcare devices, military equipments, ..., etc) to the Internet via different communication technologies such as Wi-Fi. This connection will have impact on many sectors of our life such as industry, economy, social life, and ICT sector. Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT. Then, we present the recent timing and fault Side Channel Attacks on cryptosystem implementations for the most secure encryption algorithms (AES, ECC, and RSA). Also, the countermeasures to protect these cryptosystems from such attacks are also presented.},

abstract={The advances in IT sector, cloud computing, the wide usage of sensors and mobile devices, and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) made our world looks like a small town. These rapid developments keep us connected all the day and seven days a week. Also, the IoT enables the connection of the devices around us (including different sensors) to the internet via different wireless and wired communication technologies. These networked sensors can be used to collect different types of data from different applications (healthcare, agriculture, civil and social life) and send it for processing and extraction of appropriate decisions. The mobile cloud computing technology is an efficient solution to process different types of collected data and respond with the required answer in real time situations where the quick response is very important. In this paper, we build a multipurpose integrated sensors system. This integrated system consists of networked sensors for different purposes and applications. For example, the sensors can be health sensors to measure the pulse and blood pressure of patients, or it can be sensors to measure the temperature to indicate a fire accident. The networked sensors will transfer the sensed data through wireless technologies to a Cloud for processing and notifying the listed users to take the proper action.},

abstract={A smart factory requires an efficient interaction between a number of physical components on the factory floor with the respective analytical and decision making components from digital domain. The flow of this information has to be continuous in order to reduce the downtime and maintain the productivity target. A smart factory should provide immediate access to the status of processes and device components to the relevant factory operators. With advancement in the concept of internet of things (IoT), many industrial devices on the factory floor now have wireless connectivity. Bluetooth technology is increasingly being used in order to provide operational and productivity status of devices to the factory floor operator. The operator typically has a smart device such as a tablet from where the respective devices can be monitored or controlled. As Bluetooth has a limited range, typically around 5-10 meters, an operator needs to come within this range of the device in order to connect with the respective industrial device and obtain its health and operational status data. Also Bluetooth mainly provides a point-to-point connectivity, thus at a time only one industrial device can be connected. For a factory floor that can have hundreds and thousands of such devices, this task of personally going and obtaining the data from every individual device could be tedious and cumbersome.},

abstract={The recent proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and wearable devices has given rise to crowdsourcing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure threefactor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card, 2) password and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Burrows- Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. With the combination of high security and appreciably low communication and computational overheads, our scheme is very much practical for battery limited devices for the healthcare applications as compared to other existing related schemes.},

abstract={Sensor networks, radio-equipped drones, and satellites are widely used to retrieve sensor data in many applications such as health care, smart cities and precision agriculture. Nevertheless, the high-power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements if not equipped with backscattering technologies such as RFID. This work shows how a quantum tunneling RFID tag enables the use of RFIDs in new applications by minimizing battery waste and by drastically improving the range of backscattering systems. The highly sensitive 5.8 GHz quantum tunneling RFID tag achieves backscattering free space ranges above 1.2 km while consuming biasing powers as low as 20.4 μW. This is over 10 times higher than the maximum range of a semi-passive 5.8 GHz RFID ideal link. The quantum tunneling tag is characterized by return gains as high as 35 dB, a simple RF front-end, a sensitivity of -84 dBm, and increasing SNRs for increasing RF impinging powers. This work lays out the basis for both entrepreneurial and research activities that will lead to a new class of long-range backscattering passive sensors with power consumption far lower than traditional radios.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to identify and geolocate nutrient deficiencies in oil-palm plantations using a mobile application. The process starts when the user captures an image of an oil-palm leaf with the integrated camera of an Android smart device. Then, the application processes and classifies the image into four categories corresponding to: a healthy palm, or a specimen with a deficit of Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), or Nitrogen (N). Finally, the application shows the corresponding predictions on the screen and it includes the current timestamp and GPS coordinate. However, if the smart device has an internet connection, the application also sends the processed data to Microsoft Azure for long-term storage and it enables the visualization of historic predictions through a web report built with Microsoft Power BI. The developed application allows producers to obtain in situ diagnosis of plant deficiencies in their crops, helping nutrient management plans and crop management policies. The proposed solution can be easily scaled to hundreds of devices for field deployments because each mobile application is configured as an Internet-of-Things device in the Azure Cloud.},

The IASA system uses an air quality sensor, gateway device, and smart thermostat to control the fan in a home's heating and cooling system. When fine particulate matter is high, the system operates the fan to pull air through a furnace filter and remove the pollution from the indoor air.

abstract={The next era of computing is the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities with development of the Internet of Simulation (IoS). The existing technologies of Cloud, Edge, and Fog computing as well as HPC being applied to the domains of Big Data and deep learning are not adequate to handle the scale and complexity of the systems required to facilitate a fully integrated and automated smart city. This integration of existing systems will create an explosion of data streams at a scale not yet experienced. The additional data can be combined with simulations as services (SIMaaS) to provide a shared model of reality across all integrated systems, things, devices, and individuals within the city. There are also numerous challenges in managing the security and safety of the integrated systems. This paper presents an overview of the existing state-of-the-art in automating, augmenting, and integrating systems across the domains of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, energy efficiency, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, and healthcare.

abstract={Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of variation in the time interval between consecutive heart beats. HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has connected an incredible diversity of devices in novel ways, which has enabled exciting new services and opportunities. Unfortunately, IoT systems also present several important challenges to developers. This paper proposes a vision for how we may build IoT systems in the future by reconceiving IoT's fundamental unit of construction not as a "thing", but rather as a widely and finely distributed "microservice" already familiar to web service engineering circles. Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles. Our hope is that the vision of a microservices approach will help focus research that can fill in current gaps preventing more effective, interoperable, and secure IoT services and solutions in a wide variety of contexts.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions to create a smart, connected city that is composed of ubiquitous environmental and user sensing along with distributed, low capacity computing. This provides ample information regarding the citizens in various smart environments. We can leverage this people-centric information, provided by the smart city infrastructure, to improve “smart health” applications: user data from connected wearable devices can be accompanied with ubiquitous environmental sensing and versatile actuation. The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation. In this work, we apply our modular approach for IoT applications – the context engine – to smart health problems, enabling the ability to grow with available data, use general-purpose machine learning, and reduce compute redundancy and complexity. For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment. We demonstrate the potential with three sets of interconnected context-aware applications, extracting health related people-centric context such as user presence, user activity, air quality, and location from IoT sensors.},

To address these problems, a healthcare system (HES) framework is designed that collects medical data from WBANs, transmits them through an extensive wireless sensor network infrastructure, and finally, publishes them into wireless personal-area networks via a gateway. Furthermore, HES involves the groups of send-receive model scheme to realize key distribution and secure data transmission, the homomorphic encryption based on matrix scheme to ensure privacy, and an expert system able to analyze the scrambled medical data and feedback the results automatically. Theoretical and experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the security, privacy, and improved performance of HES compared with current systems or schemes.

abstract={The rapid advances in modern wireless technology opens the door for new applications using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In the medical field, staff members of a certain hospital are in need for a system that tracks where patients/medical staff/devices are at any given time. LoCATE, which is Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment, provides a near-real time tracking tool for medical systems using the existing 802.11 WiFi infrastructure. The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara® RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions. While implications for an IoT system such as LoCATE are wide-ranging; its primary objective is to provide an easy to use, low-cost solution to track the location of medical assets in real-time.},

abstract={As the Internet of Things technology is developing rapidly, companies have an ability to observe the health of engine components and constructed systems through collecting signals from sensors. According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing- into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used. The output of the LSTM network is deciding the current life condition of components and offering the alerts for components before the end of their life. The proposed model also trained and tested on an open source data that is about an engine degradation simulation provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.},

abstract={Due to its abilities to capture real-time data concerning the physical world, the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon is fast gaining momentum in different applicative domains. Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},

abstract={Over the last two decades, manufacturing across the globe has evolved to be more intel-ligent and data driven. In the age of industrial Internet of Things, a smart production unit can be perceived as a large connected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics that can relay data and communicate with each other. While, traditionally, the focus has been on machine health and predictive maintenance, the manufacturing industry has also started focusing on analyzing data from the entire production line. These applications bring a new set of analytics challenges. Unlike traditional data mining analysis, which consists of lean datasets (that is, datasets with few features), manufacturing has fat datasets. In addition, previous approaches to manufacturing analytics restricted themselves to small time periods of data. The latest advances in big data analytics allows researchers to do a deep dive into years of data. Bosch collects and utilizes all available information about its products to increase its understanding of complex linear and nonlinear relationships between parts, machines, and assembly lines. This helps in use cases such as the discovery of the root cause of internal defects. This article presents a case study and provides detail about challenges and approaches in data extraction, modeling, and visualization.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast-growing field based on different techniques and applications. In this paper, we focus on IoT in monitoring mission which is widely used in every-day life, such as security surveillance, health-care, independent live, etc. In order to overcome the challenges of various viewpoints and heterogenous sensors in IoT, we propose a novel method named class-constrained transfer linear discriminant analysis (CTLDA), which learns two projection matrices with different dimensionality for mapping the original features into a common subspace. The target of learning two projection matrices is to maximize the inter-class data and minimize the intra-class data. Meanwhile, we propose the class-constrained regularization which enforces the neighboring samples with the same class to be still close to each other so as to further improve the discrimination of CTLDA. The class-constrained regularization possesses two strategies, i.e., hard constraint and soft constraint. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Our world and our lives are changing in many ways. Communication, networking, and computing technologies are among the most influential enablers that shape our lives today. Digital data and connected worlds of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.},

abstract={The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real-world objects (i.e. things). Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.},

abstract={In the emerging era of Internet of Things (IoT) where various physical entities are spontaneously communicating with each other and sharing sensitive information, it is prohibitive to have a global entity for maintaining the security of the complex web against environmental variations and active attacks. Therefore, it is crucial that each entity has the capability of safeguarding its security features on its own. Methods based on harnessing the random identification and authentication from the physical device and environment, such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), if securely run, are promising primitives for protecting lightweight IoT devices. This paper presents the first Built-In-Self-Test scheme for on-the-fly evaluation of PUFs that can also be utilized for assessing the desired statistical properties of TRNGs. Unlike earlier known PUF evaluation suites that were software-based and offline, our methodology enables online assessment of the pertinent statistical and security properties all in hardware. Specifically, the BIST structure is designed to evaluate two main properties of PUFs: unpredictability and stability. Our work is the first online test suite that thoroughly evaluates the internal health of the entropy source of TRNGs along with the statistical properties of the generated bit stream. Comprehensive real-time evaluation by the BIST method is able to ensure robustness and security of both TRNG and PUF in the face of operational, structural, and environmental fluctuations due to variations, aging, or adversarial acts. Proof-of-concept implementation of our BIST methodology in FPGA demonstrates its reasonable overhead, effectiveness, and practicality.},

abstract={Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global healthcare system. A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},

abstract={Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses. To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard.},

abstract={Internet of Things is smartly changing various existing research areas into new themes, including smart health, smart home, smart industry, and smart transport. Relying on the basis of “smart transport,” Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is evolving as a new theme of research and development from vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This paper presents a comprehensive framework of IoV with emphasis on layered architecture, protocol stack, network model, challenges, and future aspects. Specifically, following the background on the evolution of VANETs and motivation on IoV an overview of IoV is presented as the heterogeneous vehicular networks. The IoV includes five types of vehicular communications, namely, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-roadside, vehicle-to-infrastructure of cellular networks, vehicle-to-personal devices, and vehicle-to-sensors. A five layered architecture of IoV is proposed considering functionalities and representations of each layer. A protocol stack for the layered architecture is structured considering management, operational, and security planes. A network model of IoV is proposed based on the three network elements, including cloud, connection, and client. The benefits of the design and development of IoV are highlighted by performing a qualitative comparison between IoV and VANETs. Finally, the challenges ahead for realizing IoV are discussed and future aspects of IoV are envisioned.},

abstract={Image or video exchange over the Internet of Things (IoT) is a requirement in diverse applications, including smart health care, smart structures, and smart transportations. This paper presents a modular and extensible quadrotor architecture and its specific prototyping for automatic tracking applications. The architecture is extensible and based on off-the-shelf components for easy system prototyping. A target tracking and acquisition application is presented in detail to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the proposed design. Complete design details of the platform are also presented. The designed module implements the basic proportional-integral-derivative control and a custom target acquisition algorithm. Details of the sliding-window-based algorithm are also presented. This algorithm performs $20times $ faster than comparable approaches in OpenCV with equal accuracy. Additional modules can be integrated for more complex applications, such as search-and-rescue, automatic object tracking, and traffic congestion analysis. A hardware architecture for the newly introduced Better Portable Graphics (BPG) compression algorithm is also introduced in the framework of the extensible quadrotor architecture. Since its introduction in 1987, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) graphics format has been the de facto choice for image compression. However, the new compression technique BPG outperforms the JPEG in terms of compression quality and size of the compressed file. The objective is to present a hardware architecture for enhanced real-time compression of the image. Finally, a prototyping platform of a hardware architecture for a secure digital camera (SDC) integrated with the secure BPG (SBPG) compression algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture is suitable for high-performance imaging in the IoT and is prototyped in Simulink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever proposed hardware architecture for SBPG compression integrated with a- SDC.},

abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},

abstract={As the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Web of Things (WoT) are becoming a reality, their interconnection with mobile phone computing is increasing. Mobile phone integrated sensors offer advanced services, which when combined with Web-enabled real-world devices located near the mobile user (e.g., body area networks, radio-frequency identification tags, energy monitors, environmental sensors, etc.), have the potential of enhancing the overall user knowledge, perception and experience, encouraging more informed choices and better decisions. This paper serves as a survey of the most significant work performed in the area of mobile phone computing combined with the IoT/WoT. A selection of over 100 papers is presented, which constitute the most significant work in the field up to date, categorizing these papers into ten different domains, according to the area of application (i.e., health, sports, gaming, transportation, and agriculture), the nature of interaction (i.e., participatory sensing, eco-feedback, actuation, and control), or the communicating actors involved (i.e., things and people).

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is entering the daily operation of many industries; applications include but are not limited to smart cities, smart grids, smart homes, physical security, e-health, asset management, and logistics. For example, the concept of smart cities is emerging in multiple continents, where enhanced street lighting controls, infrastructure monitoring, public safety and surveillance, physical security, gunshot detection, meter reading, and transportation analysis and optimization systems are being deployed on a city-wide scale. A related and cost-effective user-level IoT application is the support of IoT-enabled smart buildings. Commercial space has substantial requirements in terms of comfort, usability, security, and energy management. IoT-based systems can support these requirements in an organic manner. In particular, power over Ethernet, as part of an IoT-based solution, offers disruptive opportunities in revolutionizing the in-building connectivity of a large swath of devices. However, a number of deployment-limiting issues currently impact the scope of IoT utilization, including lack of comprehensive end-to-end standards, fragmented cybersecurity solutions, and a relative dearth of fully-developed vertical applications. This paper reviews some of the technical opportunities offered and the technical challenges faced by the IoT in the smart building arena.},

abstract={The Internet-of-things (IoT) refer to the massive integration of electronic devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects to collect and exchange data. It is the enabling technology for a plethora of applications touching various aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, wearables, surveillance, home automation, smart manufacturing, and intelligent automotive systems. Existing IoT architectures are highly centralized and heavily rely on a back-end core network for all decision-making processes. This may lead to inefficiencies in terms of latency, network traffic management, computational processing, and power consumption. In this paper, we advocate the empowerment of front-end IoT devices to support the back-end network in fulfilling end-user applications requirements mainly by means of improved connectivity and efficient network management. A novel conceptual framework is presented for a new generation of IoT devices that will enable multiple new features for both the IoT administrators as well as end users. Exploiting the recent emergence of software-defined architecture, these smart IoT devices will allow fast, reliable, and intelligent management of diverse IoT-based applications. After highlighting relevant shortcomings of the existing IoT architectures, we outline some key design perspectives to enable front-end intelligence while shedding light on promising future research directions.},

abstract={This paper presents a new eHealth platform incorporating humanoid robots to support an emerging multidimensional care approach for the treatment of diabetes. The architecture of the platform extends the Internet of Things to a Web-centric paradigm through utilizing existing Web standards to access and control objects of the physical layer. This incorporates capillary networks, each of which encompasses a set of medical sensors linked wirelessly to a humanoid robot linked (via the Internet) to a Web-centric disease management hub. This provides a set of services for both patients and their caregivers that support the full continuum of the multidimensional care approach of diabetes. The platform’s software architecture pattern enables the development of various applications without knowing low-level details of the platform. This is achieved through unifying the access interface and mechanism of handling service requests through a layered approach based on object virtualization and automatic service delivery. A fully functional prototype is developed, and its end-to-end functionality and acceptability are tested successfully through a clinician-led pilot study, providing evidence that both patients and caregivers are receptive to the introduction of the proposed platform.},

abstract={Routing plays an important role in the overall architecture of the Internet of Things. IETF has standardized the RPL routing protocol to provide the interoperability for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). LLNs cover a wide scope of applications, such as building automation, industrial control, healthcare, and so on. LLNs applications require reliable and energy-efficient routing support. Point-to-point (P2P) communication is a fundamental requirement of many LLNs applications. However, traditional routing protocols usually propagate throughout the whole network to discover a reliable P2P route, which requires large amount energy consumption. Again, it is challenging to achieve both reliability and energy-efficiency simultaneously, especially for LLNs. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient region-based routing protocol (ER-RPL), which achieves energy-efficient data delivery without compromising reliability. In contrast of traditional routing protocols where all nodes are required for route discovery, the proposed scheme only requires a subset of nodes to do the job, which is the key of energy saving. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies demonstrate that ER-RPL has a great performance superiority over two conventional benchmark protocols, i.e., RPL and P2P-RPL.},

pages={4609-4617},
abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where WSNs will play an important role in future internet by several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M<;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel data compression and transmission scheme for power reduction in Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled wireless sensors. In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received significant attention in recent years and have found a wide range of applications, including structural and environmental monitoring, mobile health, home automation, Internet of Things, and others. As these systems are generally battery operated, major research efforts focus on reducing power consumption, especially for communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the most power-hungry components of a WSN. Moreover, with the advent of energy-neutral systems, the emphasis has shifted toward research in microwatt (or even nanowatt) communication protocols or systems. A significant number of wake-up radio receiver (WUR) architectures have been proposed to reduce the communication power of WSN nodes. In this work, we present an optimized ultra-low power (nanowatt) wake-up receiver for use in WSNs, designed with low-cost off-the-shelf components. The wake-up receiver achieves power consumption of 152 nW (with -32 dBm sensitivity), sensitivity up to -55 dBm (with maximum power of 1,2 μW), latency from 8 μs, tunable frequency, and short commands communication. In addition, a low power solution, which includes addressing capability directly in the wake-up receiver, is proposed. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate low power consumption, functionality, and benefits of the design optimization compared with other solutions, as well as the benefits of addressing false positive (FP) outcomes reduction.},

abstract={With the breakthrough of the Internet of Things and the steady increase of wireless applications in the daily environment, the assessment of radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure is key in determining possible health effects of exposure to certain levels of RF-EMF. This paper presents the first experimental validation of a novel personal exposimeter system based on a distributed measurement approach to achieve higher measurement quality and lower measurement variability than the commonly used single point measurement approach of existing exposimeters. An important feature of the system is the integration of inertial sensors in order to determine activity and posture during exposure measurements. The system is designed to assess exposure to frequencies within the 389 to 464, 779 to 928 and 2400 to 2483.5 MHz bands using only two transceivers per node. In this study, the 2400 to 2483.5 MHz band is validated. Every node provides antenna diversity for the different bands in order to achieve higher sensitivity at these frequencies. Two AAA batteries power each standalone node and as such determine the node hardware size of this proof of concept (53 mm×25 mm×15 mm), making it smaller than any other commercially available exposimeter.},

abstract={Roadway safety is a serious public health issue. Vehicle crashes on the roads and highways cost loss of lives and damages to properties. Technology exists today to help identify and respond quickly to crashes, which is specially critical in rural areas. A feature that enables a car to warn its driver against an eminent crash or to recommend the proper speed based on traffic and weather conditions is much needed in today's Internet of Things (IoT) era. Connected Vehicle (CV) technologies are contributing towards fulfilling this need. In this paper, we present a safety driving system through a cooperative hazard awareness and avoidance (CHAA) system based on V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communications. Our approach is based on DSRC-based V2V communications. It aims to alert drivers and recommend the proper speeds for vehicles that are approaching a hazardous zone due, for instance, to low visibility conditions. We also validate the proposed hazard alert and speed recommender system under various scenarios through simulations using the iTetris platform and SUMO simulator and we demonstrate its outperformance, compared to a regular environment, in terms of risk reduction and road safety efficiency. To this end, we have adapted iTetris by updating some of its existing features (like the Geo-broadcast routing capability) which is another contribution of this paper.},

abstract={Bearing is one of the most critical components in most electrical and power drives. Effective bearing fault diagnosis is important for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and operating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitoring systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals acquired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification performance on various bearing faults under different working conditions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the presented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds.},

abstract={Recent advances in technologies have allowed the design of small-size low-power and low-cost devices that can be connected to the Internet, enabling the emerging paradigm of Internet-of-things (IoT). IoT covers an ever-increasing range of applications, e.g., health-care monitoring, smart homes and buildings, etc. In this invited paper, we discuss and summarize the IoT paradigm with a special focus on energy consumption and methodologies for its minimization. Furthermore, we also discuss about reliability in the context of IoT devices. In all, this paper attempts to be a starting point for readers interested in developing energy-efficient IoT devices.},

abstract={Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is one of the key technologies to realize Internet of Things (IoT). Since IoT applications are mainly for smart sensing, such as metering, home surveillance, disaster detection, and e-health, their special sensing/uploading behaviors will result in periodic and/or event-driven small data transmissions, which may potentially decrease the radio resource efficiency. On the other hand, the widespread deployment of IoT raises the concurrent massive connectivity of IoT devices. How to solve these two problems is a critical issue. In this paper, we investigate an uplink resource allocation problem which considers the periodic, event-driven, and query-based IoT traffic behaviors over LTE-M. The proposed approach takes advantage of data aggregation and both spatial and temporal reuse. Our solution exploits long-term static scheduling for periodic data to ensure the latency and data rate, and employs short-term dynamic scheduling for event-driven, query-based data to improve transmission efficiency. Therefore, both small data and massive connectivity problems are relieved. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve resource efficiency and enlarge network capacity effectively.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) systems are becoming multidisciplinary day by day and integrating more and more mechanical, electrical, electronics, control and information disciplines. This integration is making mechatronics systems based on IoT easily available for public uses. Government organisations, different industries, healthcare systems and individual users are using these systems to store different kind of public, private, confidential and classified information. This is attracting cyber attackers to make cyber and cyber physical attacks to these systems. Currently, security policy researchers of both industries and academic institutes are analysing existing cyber attacks and are developing different types of techniques to protect the systems against potential cyber-threats and cyber attacks. This paper analyses the increasing exploitation of IoT based mechatronics system, which has created more opportunities for the current cybercrimes.

abstract={In recent decades the aging of the population has led to a change in the health held with special attention to the issue of home care and e-health. The aim is to provide different types of health care services to the patient's home rather than in hospital so improving the quality of life of patients by allowing them to stay in their own home environment. The healthcare sector is undergoing profound transformation thanks to the possibilities offered by the Internet of Things and new technologies, the mobile and wearable. The new model is oriented to the overall health of the patient, stimulated and implemented through a strong pro activities of the patient and realized using mobile devices and multi-channel technology. The idea is to introduce a set of functionalities in order to support the family or the patient, to act independently or to support existing treatments coaching systems. With this aim the paper proposes an architecture, based on a cognitive model, to realize a coaching system for daily living activities which relies on solving a problem as an human so modeling human cognition.

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks comprise tiny devices with limited processing power and tight energy restrictions. These limitations make it difficult to use established security mechanisms protecting the devices against malicious attacks. This holds particularly for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that help to detect various net-based attacks but often demand significant network and computing resources. In this article, we design and evaluate some IDS mechanisms for IoT Networks that are suited to small devices. They use a trust management mechanism that allows devices to manage reputation information about their neighbors. This mechanism makes it possible to single out maliciously behaving units in a processing and energy-friendly way. The approach is explained in the context of the healthcare domain.},

abstract={Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency nowadays. Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.},

abstract={The pervasive computing discipline has evolved substantially since its inception. A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues. I will present use cases, highlight the challenges, describe our approaches, and relate to client expe- iences.},

abstract={The number of Internet-connected everyday objects grows thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). The trend with this new paradigm where smart embedded devices, people, and systems are connected, is that over the next few years we could see a shift in the notion of what it means to be "on the Internet". In this context, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology is an essential component of IoT because it consists of a collection of sensor nodes connected through wireless channels, capable of providing digital interfaces to the real-world things. Moreover, as it occurs in IoT, specific WSN applications can be applied to a wide variety of domains like health, agriculture, logistics, wearable computing and others. However, recent works considered as WSN applications are being called as IoT applications without distinguishing the new features that characterize this denomination. Hence, in this paper we propose to contrast IoT and WSN from a conceptual overview, aiming to find out the relationship between them and to highlight their differences in terms of (i) the thesaurus proposed by IEEE, ACM and UNESCO, (ii) by performing a chronological review of the concepts since these terms appeared, (iii) the definition issued by reference organizations and researchers, and (iv) the main application requirements addressed by reference architectures proposed for both fields of study.},

In this paper, we present a system prototype of interconnected hand-hygiene stations that use a combination Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies for monitoring the hand hygiene compliance rate. The cloud-connected hand hygiene stations can cooperate to detect hand hygiene events in real-time, and help measuring the hand hygiene compliance at large-scale health-care facilities where it is deployed.

abstract={Sensors are important components in the Internet of Things (IoT) that encompass a wide spectrum of applications from healthcare to monitoring critical infrastructure. Securely gathering sensor measurements by adopting traditional cryptographic mechanisms is fraught with vulnerabilities emanating from the inability to safeguard secrets on edge devices, often in adversarial environments, where appropriate hardware protection logic and power consumption overheads are counterproductive to the desire to keep the devices low cost and long lasting. This paper continues recent efforts into investigating an alternative secure sensing approach with the potential to provide a solution for resource-restricted IoT devices. In particular, we investigate the possibility to exploit unreliability of a physical unclonable function (PUF) resulting from its sensitivity to variations in supply voltage conditions to guarantee the veracity of physical measurements from potentially any transducer capable of converting a physical phenomenon to a voltage signal. Therefore we present an approach that has the potential to realize a universal PUF sensor where the PUF itself acts as a sensor or is integrated with a sensor. Thus, for a PUF sensor, cryptographic processes and sensing are inseparable. Further, we rely on a dominant external condition-voltage-responsible for unreliability to secure sensing. We validate the feasibility of the proposed universal PUF sensor approach based on experimental data extracted from RO-PUFs (Ring Oscillator PUFs).},

Meanwhile, Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) have proved themselves to be promising tools for driving and managing devices within IoT systems. However, past works have not fully addressed how the IoT-based BPMS can continue their execution when the involved IoT devices do not have a reliable Internet connection. In this paper, we propose a system design for decentralised device-to-device (D2D)-based BP execution, where mobile nodes have the capability of both executing BPs but also migrating BP execution to other nodes during runtime. We apply this design to the field of smart logistics, in order to enable smart goods monitoring. The presented goods monitoring solution enables reacting to events as soon as they occur, while also generating a trace of the monitoring execution history. A prototype focusing on the migration functionality of the platform has been implemented and tested to evaluate its performance in the context of the mentioned smart logistics scenario.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidlly in various sectors including health sector. There are many technologies used for IoT such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE-Advanced. IoT for health sector in Indonesia is used to improve health services based on telemedicine services roadmap by Indonesian Ministry of Health. This services include teleECG, teleRadiology and teleUSG which utilize mobile technology. In Indonesia, there is a tendency that IoT will be implemented on a large scale. Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to experience deficiency of 500 MHz mobile spectrum in 2020. Therefore, the calculation of spectrum for telemedicine services is urgently needed. This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia. The government of Indonesia should prepare about strategic spectrum management to anticipate the massive growing of IoT application, such as a roadmap of IoT development and a regulation of specific frequency in the nearest future.},

Further, the applications of IoT in sensing the glucose level, ECG monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, wheelchair management, medication management and rehabilitation system are analyzed. The analysis results show that the use of IoT in the medical field increases the quality of life, user experience, patient outcomes and real-time disease management. The introduction of medical IoT is not without security challenges. Hence, the security threats such as confidentiality, authentication, privacy, access control, trust, and policy enforcement are analyzed. The presence of these threats affect the performance of IoT, thus, the cryptographic algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) are used. The investigation on these techniques proves that the RSA provides better security than the AES and DES algorithms.},

abstract={In current cyber-physical systems, IoT represents interconnection of highly heterogeneous networked entities, providing goods and services to a variety of domains including environment monitoring, energy management, health-care system, and industrial automation. However, in-spite of the advantages of global connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT) encounter various security challenges and resource constraints including identity management, traceability, storing and processing of veracious sensory data. However, the security research in IoT so far have not focused on provenance and its usefulness in IoT. To keep data traces of IoT devices, provenance can play a vital role as it solves many issues related to data trustworthiness, decision-making, data reconciliation and data replication. In this paper, we have discussed the challenges on technical infrastructure of IP-based, WSN-based and RFID-based IoT. We have identified the possible ways to integrate secure provenance into IoT grounded on security issues and other resource constraints in IoT.},

abstract={Now a day's monitoring the water quality is a key essential need to analyze locality of water condition in terms of its physical, and chemical characteristics. Since traditional water quality monitoring system are inflexible to adapt sudden changes promptly at a long distance as well as its time consuming process and difficult task to get values of water parameter in real time operation. To overcome these key challenging issues a new system have been implemented for monitoring the contaminated water quality by adapting new technologies such as IoT(Internet of Things), WSN's(Wireless sensor network) and communication standards. IoT and WSN's have been grabbed attention towards it in all real time applications (Manufacturing system, Health care system and Industrial monitoring systems) for providing worldwide network to each interconnected objects for collecting data about physical things by using standard communication protocol. The performance analysis of the proposed systems is carried out by collecting water parameters data from different sensing elements (Turbidity, Density, Temperature and PH) at base station and comparing with its threshold value at the monitoring unit. Hence implemented system makes awareness and avoids major risk related to spreading of polluted industrial water at a long distance with low cost.},

abstract={Allowing users to control access to their data is paramount for the success of the Internet of Things, therefore, it is imperative to ensure it, even when data has left the users' control, e.g. shared with cloud infrastructure. Consequently, we propose several state of the art mechanisms from the security and privacy research fields to cope with this requirement. To illustrate how each mechanism can be applied, we derive a data-centric architecture providing access control and privacy guaranties for the users of IoT-based applications. Moreover, we discuss the limitations and challenges related to applying the selected mechanisms to ensure access control remotely. Also, we validate our architecture by showing how it empowers users to control access to their health data in a quantified self use case.},

abstract={Recently, big data analytics has received important attention in a variety of application domains including business, finance, space science, healthcare, telecommunication and Internet of Things (IoT). Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.},

abstract={Modern research directions in smart environment include analysis of factors that influence overall human Quality of Life (QoL). Context influence factors (CIF) are unavoidable within smart environment research. In this paper, we address indoor air quality (IAQ) as one of the main CIF. The major contaminants of indoor air are CO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There are still no satisfactory methods for air pollutants monitoring and removal. The ability of plants to detoxify these compounds makes biological systems the promising technologies for this purpose. Although precise mechanisms how plants remove VOC are unknown and current knowledge is based on experiments conducted under controlled conditions, it does not prevent us not to use biological air purifiers. Our measurements under uncontrolled conditions in environments where people live, showed that houseplants' ability to reduce VOC differs from one to another environment. Instead of attempt to design the unique botanical system for air purification, we proposed internet of things (IoT) based methodology for continuous monitoring and objective assessment of IAQ aiming to improve the designing and adaptation of botanical purifiers to specific environment, user's health, living habits and requirements.},

abstract={New prospects for health care monitoring is engendered by the augmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big data, as well as the ubiquitous nature of tiny wearable bio sensors. Many confront have yet to be addressed to create a dependable and flexible system for health care monitoring. In this paper Big data analytics on IoT based Health care system is proposed. IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework. Since the response time of the proposed system is less, it is suitable for real time alerting.},

This paper investigates the use of RPL in dynamic networks and presents an enhanced RPL for different applications with dynamic mobility and diverse network requirements. This implementation of RPL is designed with a new dynamic Objective-Function (D-OF) to improve the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption while maintaining low packet overhead and loop-avoidance. We propose a controlled reverse-trickle timer based on received signal strength identification (RSSI) readings to maintain high responsiveness with minimum overhead and consult the objective function when a movement or an inconsistency is detected to help nodes make an informed decision. Simulations are done using Cooja with random waypoint mobility scenario for healthcare applications considering multi-hop routing. The results show that the proposed dynamic RPL (D-RPL) adapts to the nodes mobility and has a higher PDR, slightly lower end-to-end delay and reasonable energy consumption compared to related existing protocols.},

abstract={The word Cloud has been a buzzword since last few years but there has been lot of confusion happening in the cloud market with respect to selection of best cloud provider at the cheapest prize and achieving the highest resource efficiency for the cloud providers. As now the entire world is moving to achieve goal of becoming SMART PLANET, the technologies like IoT -Internet of Things getting popular and unavoidable in current scenario. As usage of IoT leads to huge collection of data, it certainly requires cloud platform to store the data and perform data analytics and decision making. Recent projects like SMART CITY which involves smart traffic management system, smart waste management system, smart water system etc. would involve various cloud providers offering services & resources and various cloud users using their services. So problem of resource utilization and profit maximization becomes very critical in this scenario. This paper focuses on survey of various auction mechanisms proposed for cloud market to solve the problem of decision making, resource utilization and cost efficiency. It also reviews various decision making models based on MCDM - Multi Criteria Decision Making approach. Very few attempts been made till date to support cloud users decision making process by considering various parameters/requirements. In this paper we are proposing decision making by using models like AHP(Analytical Hierarchy Process) combined with Double Sided Auction to select best cloud provider in an open cloud market with heterogeneous cloud user requirements and healthy competition amongst the cloud providers. In an open cloud market where multiple cloud providers are offering various services at varied cost, it's a very difficult decision for a user to select a best cloud service provider with best cost efficiency matching with various other parameters (like reliability, speed, user experience etc..) The providers also need to achieve best resource efficiency so that s- aring/allocation of resources to various users are optimized. As there is no standard process to help user to make a decision, this paper focuses on combining Auction and AHP models together to help cloud users and providers to achieve win-win situation by achieving best resource, time, cost efficiency with heterogeneous environments and demands.},

abstract={With the increase in popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), pervasive computing, healthcare services, sensor networks, and mobile devices, a lot of data is being generated at the perception layer. Cloud is the most viable solution for data storage, processing, and management. Cloud also helps in the creation of further services, refined according to the context and requirement. However, being reachable through the Internet, cloud is not efficient enough for latency sensitive multimedia services and other time-sensitive services, like emergency and healthcare. Fog, an extended cloud lying within the proximity of underlying nodes, can mitigate the issues traditional cloud cannot solve being standalone. Fog can provide quick response to the requiring applications. Moreover, it can preprocess and filter data according to the requirements. Trimmed data is then sent to the cloud for further analysis and enhanced service provisioning. However, how much better is it to have a fog in any particular scenario instead of a standalone cloud working without fog is a question right now. In this paper, we provide an answer by analyzing both cloud-only and cloud-fog scenarios in the context of processing delay and power consumption according to increasing number of users, on the basis of varying server load. The simulation is done through Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). Simulation results demonstrate that by the use of fog networks, users experienced lower waiting times and increased data rates.},

abstract={A device to detect certain parameters of brainwaves like alpha, beta, delta, etc., to judge the behavior of mental state. Using this novel approach various factors like attention, stress, breathing index can be judged efficiently. To make it a complete e-health device, EOG (Electrooculography) sensor is introduced to it, to monitor the ocular movement of the eye and also to make it an autonomous device. The sole purpose of this system is to correctly detect and categorize the type of brainwaves and the eye movements, and then feed the input to the application side. The system consists of two parts: a) the hardware and b) digital signal processing module. The software part consists of the LabVIEW graphical program to monitor the components of brain waves. This research found a promising technique for reducing the complexities and to develop an overall e-health device, which could be further modified using the applications of Internet of Things (IoT).},

abstract={Remote patient monitoring is essential for many patients that are suffering from acute diseases such as different heart conditions. Continuous health monitoring can provide medical services that consider the current medical state of the patient and to predict or early-detect future potentially critical situations. In this regard, Internet of Things as a multidisciplinary paradigm can provide profound impacts. However, the current IoT-based systems may encounter difficulties to provide continuous and real time patient monitoring due to issues in data analytics.

abstract={The internet of things (IoT) requires that more data are collected and processed by devices with faster response, but lower power consumption. In order to achieve these unprecedented requirements, a high-speed DRAM with low-power dissipation at standby and during low-frequency operation in a small footprint is necessary. In addition, a higher degree of reliability is expected for some applications: such as transportation and healthcare. One promising solution, on-chip error correction coding (ECC), has gained traction among memory companies [1] and is now required by the LPDDR4 standard for the first time [2]. In this paper, a 2Gb LPDDR4 that dissipates 75% less refresh current than a conventional LPDDR4 is presented. The proposed LPDDR4 exploits ECC to reduce refresh current, periodically activated voltage regulators to reduce standby power, and dual CA buffers to save the buffer current during low frequency operation. In addition, circuit designs for cell screen of DRAM with on-chip ECC, and for high-speed wafer test for known good die (KGD) - essential for small form factor devices using system-in-package (SiP) - are presented.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is about billions of heterogeneous smart devices connected through heterogeneous communications technologies such as Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. The variety of devices and technologies pushes the development of solutions and applications in various domains. Nevertheless, it makes the management, control and programmability of networks and IoT applications (Smart city, Smart healthcare, Industry, etc.) extremely complex. Therefore, we propose an SDN-based architecture to manage heterogeneity of the devices and the networks. Our solution is based on the utilization of dockers implemented on devices. In this paper, we focus on the connectivity of heterogeneous devices beyond heterogeneous networks.

title={Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers},
year={2017},
volume={60},
number={1},
pages={4-23},
abstract={Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-qu- lity expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},

A strong framework of cloud computing, backed up by a seamless blending of sensors and actuators with the environment around us, is making this “network of networks of autonomous objects” a reality. From smart wearables to smart cities, from domestic life to industries, the IoT is expanding itself to different areas. According to Gartner Inc., the IoT will include 26 billion units installed by 2020. Smart security solutions, smart home automation, smart health care, smart wearables etc. are in-trend applications of IoT, and by the near future we expect to see its application to a city's transportation system or smart power grids. This paper presents a brief overview on different trends of the IoT and also discusses about the effects of the IoT on our day-to-day life. It also discusses the importance of cloud computing, autonomous control, artificial intelligence in the context of the IoT.

abstract={Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) services such as healthcare, smart cities, and marine monitoring are pervasive in cyber-physical environments strongly supported by Internet technologies and fog computing. Complex IoT services are increasingly composed of sensors, devices, and compute resources within fog computing infrastructures. The orchestration of such applications can be leveraged to alleviate the difficulties of maintenance and enhance data security and system reliability. However, efficiently dealing with dynamic variations and transient operational behavior is a crucial challenge within the context of choreographing complex services. Furthermore, with the rapid increase of the scale of IoT deployments, the heterogeneity, dynamicity, and uncertainty within fog environments and increased computational complexity further aggravate this challenge. This article gives an overview of the core issues, challenges, and future research directions in fog-enabled orchestration for IoT services. Additionally, it presents early experiences of an orchestration scenario, demonstrating the feasibility and initial results of using a distributed genetic algorithm in this context.},

In this space, challenges come from the needs to determine (1) contextual information such as location, duration of contact, density of devices, utilizing networked sensory information; (2) higher level knowledge such as users' activity detection, mood detection, applications usage pattern detection and user interactions on `mobile things', utilizing contextual information; and (3) adaptive and real-time parallel and distributed architectures that integrate context, activity, mood, usage patterns into mobile application services on mobile `things'. Solving these challenges will provide enormous opportunities to improve the utility of mobile `things', optimizing scarce resources on mobile `things' such as energy, memory, and bandwidth.},

Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques. A set of representative health applications that take advantage of such tools is also described. Finally, various challenges and opportunities that arise during the realization of smart and connected healthcare IoT are highlighted.},

abstract={With the recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is now possible to process a large number of sensor data streams using different large-scale IoT platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications. Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless interoperability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the Web.},

abstract={Driven by the need to improve efficiency, modern buildings are instrumented with numerous sensors to monitor utilization and regulate environmental conditions. While these sensor systems serve as valuable tools for managing the comfort and health of occupants, there is an increasing need to expand the deployment of sensors to provide additional insights. Because many of these desired insights have high temporal value, such as occupancy during emergency situations, such insights are needed in real time. However, augmenting buildings with new sensors is often expensive and requires a significant capital investment. In this paper, we propose and describe the real-time, streaming system called Namatad that we developed to infer insights from many sensors typical of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. We evaluate the effectiveness of this platform by leveraging machine learning to infer new insights from environmental sensors within buildings. We describe how we built the components of our system leveraging several open source, streaming frameworks. We also describe how we ingest and aggregate from building sensors and sensing platforms, route data streams to appropriate models, and make predictions using machine learning techniques. Using our system, we have been able to predict the occupancy of rooms within a building on the University of Washington campus over the last three months, in real time, at accuracies of up to 95%.},

Given the IoT computational paradigm, applications that touch every aspect of modern life are now rapidly evolving.

abstract={Real-time personalization is being increasingly referred to as the next major technological milestone of the Internet age. Digital assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Google Now are the first steps towards the same. Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to drive hyper-personalization going forward, i.e., enable personalization across the board, for example but not limited to, home, health care, marketing, transportation, energy, infrastructure. There exists a large body of prior research in real-time systems. For instance, research and development of real-time systems has been done in domains such as control systems, avionics, operations research et cetera for over 50 years. With BigData analytics becoming mainstream since the turn of the century and the growing need to leverage real-time data to grow business, several real-time systems are being researched and deployed in the consumer space. Although a lot of emphasis is being laid on real-time processing, the notion of real-time is not well defined. This, in part, stems from the fact that the notion of real-time is a function of the target application. In this paper, we walk the reader through a brief history of prior work in real-time systems, give an in-depth view of the classification of real-time systems. Further, we overview the various systems in use today for real-time processing.},

abstract={The proliferation of real-time monitoring systems and the advent of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) over the past few years necessitates the development of scalable and parallel algorithms that help predict mechanical failures and remaining useful life of a manufacturing system or system components. Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations. In addition, a parallel random forest algorithm is developed using the MapReduce framework and then implemented on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Experimental results have shown that the random forest algorithm can generate very accurate predictions. Moreover, significant speedup can be achieved by implementing the parallel random forest algorithm.},

In the healthcare context, the increased deployment of IoT devices makes patient information a subject to malicious attacks depending on the security and privacy of the IoT devices. While a number of researchers have explored such security challenges and open problems in IoT, there is an unfortunate lack of a systematic study of the security challenges in the IoT for eHealth on clouds.

abstract={Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) are a challenging research area with applications in healthcare and entertainment. Due to the importance of the target applications in the daily life, BASNs are a promising candidate for being included into the future Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the data gathering of the human activity may help customizing the services provided by the IoT and thus dramatically improve the IoT user experience. Magnetic Induction (MI) based communication is known in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT), near-field communication (NFC), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in challenging environments. In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate. In this work, we analyze the potential of the distributed beamforming based MI-BASNs. We observe a significant increase of the achievable data rate for the proposed distributed beamforming compared to our selected baseline scheme.},

Firms need to look beyond their internal business models and explore cooperative perspectives to define new business opportunities. In this article, we look into the relevance of vertical cooperation in the area of IoT and highlight the need to develop new value networks that leverage this cooperation and enable the creation of new business models.

abstract={Internet of Things is basically an interconnection of many smart devices which are deployed and connected to internet, serving people anytime and anywhere. There are many application domains that IoT technology can provide very useful services such as health care, transportation, infrastructure and home. Smart devices have limited efficiency in terms of computing storage and battery power. Due to the limited storage of embedded devices, it is difficult to implement strong authorization techniques. To overcome, this problem in the IoT, we have proposed a novel architecture for building a service using open authentication protocol where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system through the IoT device. Among the various authentication protocols available today, OAuth provides many leading organizations with a simple and secure way to authenticate users and permit them to access their protected data. OAuth provides client applications secure delegated access which is commonly used for Internet users to log in to third party websites using their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts without exposing their password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the user, giving the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. We are proposing a smart fire alarm system that notifies the user about the occurrence of fire in his house. User gets an alert message through his twitter and Gmail account simultaneously. Fire alarm system is built by integrating IoT technology with temperature detecting sensors. In order to use Gmail and twitter our device need to authenticate on behalf of the user. For this we use OAuth protocol for delegated access to applications like Gmail and twitter. Conventional end-to-end encryption based techniques are not accurate to ensure better quality of security because of exceeding slow response time of the smart devices, and has extremely low processing clock speed. The proposed wo- k can offer very high level of security without compromising on the processing lack. Results shows that, device offers a low latency as compared to existing system having with 35 to 45 milliseconds for implementing the OAuthenticaion scheme.},

This paper presents an indigenous mobile health (or mHealth) solution, named GRAVID, to address the gap of unavailability of context-based information on nutrition, medical, drug and substance use appropriate to meet identified needs of gravid women and subsequently their babies (for 5 years); within the African context. GRAVID also provides a monitoring tool for healthcare givers to track the progress of the gravid woman they oversee. The project was implemented with Android software development kit (SDK) for cost-effective development and widespread community coverage. It is intended that this solution will also provide a source of collecting data to update necessary information as well as addressing related community-based issues to reduce the maternal and child mortality rates.},

Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application. The application performance is evaluated by user satisfaction scores.},

abstract={Smart metering, smart parking, health, environment monitoring, and other applications drive the deployment of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). Whilst cost and energy efficiency are the main factors that contribute to the popularity of commercial devices in the IoT domain, security features are increasingly desired. Security features typically guarantee authenticity of devices and/or data, as well as confidentiality of data in transit. Our study finds that whilst cryptographic algorithms for confidentiality and authenticity are supported in hardware on a popular class of devices, there is no adequate support for random number generation available. We show how to non-invasive manipulate the on-board source for randomness, and thereby we can completely undermine the security provided by (otherwise) strong cryptographic algorithms, with devastating results.},

abstract={Fog computing is a recently proposed computing paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for time-sensitive healthcare applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early notification of emergency situations to support smart decision making. While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications. In this work, we present dynamic Fog, a high level programming model for time-sensitive applications that are geospatially distributed, large-scale, and latency-sensitive. We also analyze our fog model with healthcare data, more specifically with Heartrate data that is one of the most time-sensitive medical data which deals with life and death situations. Our experiments show that our proposed system achieves minimum delay while it also achieves the data accuracy and data consistency which are very important in many applications like medical data.},

Currently, the OM2M (Open source platform for M2M communication) is a promising project which implements oneM2M and SmartM2M standards as an open-source platform for integrating various M2M services, applications, and devices. However, the individual data generated from those IoT/M2M devices is usually quite small, which incurs a lot of control overhead and thus decreases network performance significantly. Therefore, in this work we design and implement an OM2M 'plugin' that can aggregate small IoT data effectively. We will show how the plugin works and verify the effectiveness on the network bandwidth in this demonstration.},

pages={335-342},
abstract={With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart sensor technologies, the data-driven paradigm has been found promising to support human behavioral analysis in a smart home for better healthcare and well-being of senior adults. This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.},

In both cases, the key idea of VITESSE is to improve the time of consuming process, taking into account the real time and contextual information, in particular in the case of accidents of mobile users.

This technology offers certain benefits like automatic processing, improved logistics and device communication that would help us to improve our social life, health, living standards and infrastructure. However, due to their simple architecture and presence on wide variety of fields they pose serious concern to security. Due to the low end architecture there are many security issues associated with IoT network devices.

abstract={Healthcare is beginning to embrace point of care (POC) diagnostics and medical applications that are based on the internet of things (IoT) and the ubiquitous smart phone. Advanced medical diagnostics will utilize biosensors for biological data acquisition. This paper introduces the forecasting of biosensors that have the potential to be used in POC and IoT applications. For this research three types of biosensors were selected. These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively. Bibliometrics with annual publication count did not appear to provide much value in forecasting the maturity growth of the three biosensors.},

abstract={There is a growing emphasis to find alternative non-traditional ways to manage patients to ease the burden on health care services largely fuelled by a growing demand from sections of population that is ageing. In-home remote patient monitoring applications harnessing technological advancements in the area of Internet of things (IoT), semantic web, data analytics, and cloud computing have emerged as viable alternatives. However, such applications generate large amounts of real-time data in terms of volume, velocity, and variety thus making it a big data problem. Hence, the challenge is how to combine and analyse such data with historical patient data to obtain meaningful diagnoses suggestions within acceptable time frames (considering quality of service (QoS)). Despite the evolution of big data processing technologies (e.g. Hadoop) and scalable infrastructure (e.g. clouds), there remains a significant gap in the areas of heterogeneous data collection, real-time patient monitoring, and automated decision support (semantic reasoning) based on well-defined QoS constraints. In this study, the authors review the state-of-the-art in enabling QoS for remote health care applications. In particular, they investigate the QoS challenges required to meet the analysis and inferencing needs of such applications and to overcome the limitations of existing big data processing tools.},

The integration of Internet of things and Cloud manufacturing becomes increasingly important for the development of the industry 4.0. The objective of industry 4.0 is not just to improve the production management but also manage and reduce equipment downtime, for that many strategies could be implemented to ensure the good condition of equipment. The efficient one is the predictive maintenance which collects information from sensors and predicts the malfunction or failure in the system. Prognostics Health Manager (PHM) offers significant benefits for maintenance. It predicts the future behavior of a system as well as its remaining useful life. This paper offers a new architecture to provide PHM solutions as a service in cloud computing environment (PHM-SaaS, PHM-PaaS, PHM-IaaS). We defined the entities and actors as well as their behavior in this architecture. To test our approach we were interested by the prognostics and post-prognostics process which are the main steps in the PHM technology, the remaining useful life is estimated in the prognostics step and according to this RUL a decision is automatically provided by the post prognostics process.},

We propose a deployment model for the proposed Cyber-healthcare system, and describe a patient prioritization process as part of its situation awareness component. The results obtained from an experimental prototype reveal the field readiness of the off-the-shelf bio-sensor technology used by the system, the performance achieved when using a solar powered subsystem, the relative communication capabilities provided by its protocols and the network engineering feasibility of the planned community health care network. The relative efficiency of using supervised machine learning compared to unsupervised machine learning when performing patient prioritization, is also revealed through two popular algorithms: Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and K-means clustering (KMC).},

abstract={Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Today's healthcare system is the lack of security and real time monitoring. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients from their home itself. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a Automation Healthcare System (AHS). The proposed AHS is to investigate advanced home health care services. Data produced in AHS shared with doctors and patients through IoT. The system utilizes IoT telemetry to transmit data from sensors to a remote monitor. This paper discusses recent advances in wearable sensors healthcare system to monitor temperature, heart rate and the energy efficient routing.

In this report, ultra-low power wireless sensor nodes for monitoring of chicken health and for power saving are introduced, and as the key technologies for node power reduction, low power sensing ("tipping bucket") and communication methods are presented.

However the use of a centralized controller increases WSN traffic, decreasing its lifetime. The SDN controller could leverage from the WSN local knowledge to improve the decisions taken. We propose an architecture with distributed and hierarchical controllers, where local controllers use local information to reply to nodes in its area, and a global controller oversees the whole network.

abstract={The paradigmatic shift brought by the Internet of Things has already revolutionized many key sectors, like environmental monitoring, grid and energy management, manufacturing, and it can be seen as a promising solution to address challenging societal issues, like the ability to provide significant enhancement to quality of life for the elderly and, in general, people in need. As a consequence, Internet of Things emerges also as the possible next evolution for the Ambient Assisted Living domain. One major issue to address in this context is the identification of a suitable middleware able to leverage the potentialities offered by the Internet of Things and, at the same time, ensure the necessary support to services and functions related to healthcare and personal assistance. This paper provides an overview of middleware solutions designed for Internet of Things in health and wellness domains, and presents a case study related to assistive technology for the home monitoring of people with dementia. It is illustrated how a specific middleware designed for telemetry applications, the MQTT, can be effectively applied in assistive scenarios too, with different architectural options and communication technologies.},

This paper provides an overview of these advances. Also, we propose an IoT-based surveillance system for ubiquitous healthcare monitoring. The system consists of sensors, actuators, and cameras. Mesh topology was decided to be used as it provides important advantages. Moreover, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used for the data compression and transferring, and the Scalable High-Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) is used for the video compression and transferring. The SHVC can deliver the same video quality in half of the bit rate than the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Furthermore, cloud services are provided, such as storage and real-time monitoring. Finally, we made a comparative analysis between our proposed system architecture and two other approaches. From this analysis, we can say that our system architecture has some benefits instead of other similar architectures. Also, we made an analysis of the bandwidth and the network throughput. The results are significant since the bandwidth required for the transmission of data and video is reduced.},

abstract={Cloud computing, arguably, has become the de facto computing platform for the big data processing by researchers and practitioners for the last decade, and enabled different stakeholders to discover valuable information from large scale data. At the same time, in the decade, we have witnessed the fast growing deployment of billions of sensors and actuators in multiple applications domains, such as transportation, manufacturing, connected/wearable health care, smart city and so on, stimulating the emerging of Edge Computing (a.k.a., fog computing, cloudlet). However, data, as the core of both cloud computing and edge computing, is still owned by each stakeholder and rarely shared due to privacy concern and formidable cost of data transportation, which significantly limits Internet of Things (IoT) applications that need data input from multiple stakeholders (e.g., video analytics collects data from cameras owned by police department, transportation department, retailer stores, etc.). In this paper, we envision that in the era of IoT the demand of distributed big data sharing and processing applications will dramatically increase since the data producing and consuming are pushed to the edge of the network. Data processing in collaborative edge environment needs to fuse data owned by multiple stakeholders, while keeping the computation within stakeholders' data facilities. To attack this challenge, we propose a new computing paradigm, Firework, which is designed for big data processing in collaborative edge environment (CEE). Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of datasets and a set of functions, where the functions are privacy preserved and bound to the datasets. Firework targets to share data while ensuring data privacy and integrity for stakeholders. By pushing the data processing as close as to da- a sources, Firework also aims to avoid data movement from the edge of the network to the cloud and improve the response latency.},

abstract={To reduce the congestion due to the future bandwidth-hungry applications in domains such as Health care, Internet of Things (IoT), etc., we study the benefit of introducing additional Data Centers (DCs) closer to the network edge for the optimal application placement. Our study shows that the edge layer DCs in a Mobile Edge Network (MEN) infrastructure is cost beneficial for the bandwidth-hungry applications having their strong demand locality and in the scenarios where large capacity is deployed at the edge layer DCs. The cost savings for such applications can go up to 67%. Additional intermediate layer DCs close to the root DC can be marginally cost beneficial for the compute intensive applications with medium or low demand locality. Hence, a Telecom Network Operator should start building an edge DC first having capacity up to hundreds of servers at the network edge to cater the emerging bandwidth-hungry applications and to minimize its operational cost.},

abstract={The Internet of things (IoT) will interconnect a huge amount of devices, leading to a new way of interaction in the physical and virtual world, inspired by the idea of ubiquity, where all the objects around us, such as: sensors, automobiles, refrigerators, thermostats, industrial robots, tablets, smartphones, etc. could be connected anytime and anywhere. However, one of the main challenges that faces IoT is the high degree of heterogeneity in terms of communication capabilities of the devices, protocols, technologies or hardware. We focus on the implementation of a new Smart IoT Gateway designed to allow interconnection and interoperability between heterogeneous devices in the IoT. The proposed gateway offers significant advantages: (i) it enables connectivity of different protocols and traditional communication technologies (Ethernet) and wireless (ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi); (ii) it uses a flexible protocol that translates all the data obtained from the different sensors into a uniform format, performing the analysis of the data obtained from the environment-based-rules related to the different types of sensors; (iii) it uses a lightweight and optimal protocol on the use of devices with limited resources for delivering information environment; and (iv) it provides local data storage for later use and analysis. Our proof of concept demonstrates the performance and capacity of the proposed Smart IoT Gateway is related with Active and Healthy Aging (AHA).},

abstract={The emerging smart health and smart home applications require pervasive and non-intrusive human activity recognition and monitoring. Traditional technologies (e.g., using cameras or accelerometers and gyroscopes) may introduce privacy issues or require people to wear sensors. To address these issues, recent approaches exploit fine-grained wireless signals for activity recognition. However, these approaches require devices that are costly or need to provide unique wireless features (e.g., Doppler shifts or phase information). With the increasingly available Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in this paper, we propose Harmony, a human activity recognition and monitoring middleware which can utilize the coarse-grained (but pervasively available) received signal strength (RSS) measurements from the radios of IoT devices. We implement a complete evaluation platform (from data collection to data analysis) of the middleware on top of low cost ZigBee compliant MICAz nodes and a laptop. We also conducted extensive experiments. Our results show that our design can achieve similar accuracy as fine-grained WiFi channel state information (CSI) measurement-based approaches. Specifically, our overall human activities recognition accuracy is up to 74% and 90% for RSS readings from a single pair and 3 pairs of IoT devices, respectively.},

abstract={Recent years have seen the development of successful internet of things (IoT) technologies based on an IP-enabled 6LoWPAN, which enables the extensive message exchange of information generated from various applications such as healthcare, smart home, and factory automation. Because IoT devices are closely related to the human life, they generally handle critical data which must be protected from a malicious adversary. However, a majority of IoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of memory and computational ability, so that they cannot provide heavy security protocols and authentication. To protect connections over constrained networks, we introduce a back-end offload architecture which offloads the processing of a security protocol to a specified back-end offloader. The offloader assists constrained devices back-end by handling the packets of handshake procedure and encrypted application data. The load balancing of offloaders and the protection of offload messages are also provided in the design. The proposed architecture allows an extremely constrained device to establish a secure session by utilizing high-level authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate, without the burden of deploying heavy security modules. This research would be advantageous for incompetent nodes to support security and reduce cost at the same time.},

This paper is concerned with Health IoT consisting of various devices carried by members of an environmental health community of interest (CoI). We propose trust based information sharing among the CoI users of these IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and at a given time. This rated knowledge of various environments would enable a user's mobile device to automatically decide whether or not the user should visit this place/environment. Our trust-based decision making framework considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making. Performance data are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract={Despite the promising applicability of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as for home automation and health monitoring, it is laborious to develop an IoT application, because programmers should explicitly manipulate communication for shared data across heterogeneous distributed IoT devices. Recent proposals simplify the communication management with graphical views or language extensions but still require programmers to explicitly manage communication. To liberate programmers from explicit communication management, this article revisits heterogeneous distributed shared memory (HDSM) for IoT devices and proposes a compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework, called IoT-HDSM. The framework's compiler unifies heterogeneous memory layouts of different IoT devices, and the runtime system provides a shared memory view for the devices. To support lightweight devices that cannot execute the runtime, the compiler automatically inserts explicit communication instructions into the IoT application. Moreover, to efficiently control concurrent memory accesses without locks, the authors also propose a new annotation called the memory branch, which provides a memory snapshot for each device. This article describes the implementation of three IoT services with IoT-HDSM and shows that IoT-HDSM simplifies shared data management without harming QoS.},

Automated water usage monitoring system proposes an effective way of controlling the wastage of water at home/Industries by means of Wireless sensor nodes and LabVIEW software. At many places water is luxuriously wasted while many areas don't have enough. Sensor nodes are placed at every water outlet pointes sensing the flow of water. The concept of internet of things (IOT) is used to continuously monitor and track water usage via the wireless sensor nodes. Server collects the data through Wi-Fi/LAN to process and track usage and wastage of water at every outlet. When water is used at excess it is indicated and an alert is sent to the user. The user can continuously keep a track of the water usage or wastage through a mobile or laptop with an internet connection. This proposed water monitoring system helps the individuals to keep a track on their water bills and helps the government to manage the water supply and modify billing scheme based on the water usage.},

abstract={Advances in the physical sciences and engineering enable the development of internet-of-things (IoT) to understand, interface / interact and engineer physical world (systems). However, the deployment of multitude of wireless sensors and agents spanning many application domains (e.g., environmental, healthcare, smart interconnected vehicles and trucks, smart buildings) leads not only to tremendous requirements for communicating massive amounts of multiscale heterogeneous data, but also calls for developing efficient strategies for mathematical modeling of the sensed data while overcoming the energy wall. To address these outstanding challenges, out-of-the-box approaches need to be explored. In this tutorial paper, we discuss these outstanding problems and describe a few far-reaching design methodologies that achieve the most sought after features in autonomous IoT, viz. intelligent mining, smart trustworthy sensing, closed-loop (networked) control, and energy efficiency.

abstract={Many areas of today's living standard are covered by global sensing techniques using wireless sensor network approaches. It is the network that consist physical objects embedded with software, sensors, electronics. It provides connectivity that is used to enable things to exchange data with the manufacturer and other operator device which is based on the international global standards. It creates the capability to compute, conclude and understand environmental measure, from elegant ecologies. We can create IoT by distributing the work of devices in the communicating network. Using this approach we can get the way to combine actuators and sensing devices in a smooth way and common operating picture (COP) are developed by sharing information over the platforms. In this paper we show the vision, provocation, possible usage scenarios and the steps to build the Internet of Things. IP stacks and web servers technological developments are used for smart every day objects. This paper describes how IOT can be implemented in the realistic way to invoke the vision. The contents which we can use in IOT can come into picture from a big area of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders, electric clams in coastal water automobiles with the help of built in sensors among them. If we want to develop a fully integrated future internet then IOT is steeped out by enable and using the technologies which is based on wireless such as RFID tokens and attached from nodes of actuator and sensing devices. If we talk about the present scenario then the present generation of technology of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) offers two applications Distribution of Food hierarchy and Healthcare to involve human health and well-being. These two applications show the technologies and architectures of the IoT and to solve the problems arisen in the wireless sensor network architectures and the architectures to integrate the system. At the system level, we have improved integration o- distributed devices and their technologies; we also have EIS and integration of information in architectures such as prediction of shelf life and real time distribution hierarchy for food distribution IOT and distribution of health care at home.},

year={2016},
volume={},

abstract={Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and variable disease in matters of symptoms, clinical course and outcome. The ultimate goal of currently used drugs and therapeutic strategies is the control of disease activity and the delay of the ongoing disability. During the last decades, a number of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), all products of advanced biotechnology are being used. However, these DMDs are yet partially effective since the ongoing disability progression may hardly be prevented. There is growing evidence that these DMDs might be more effective if more accurate monitoring of the disease itself throughout a period of time might be available. In the new era of MS treatment and on the basis of our current knowledge about MS management, it became pretty clear that the overall therapeutic strategy should always be scheduled on strictly individualized basis. To this, MS patients should be encouraged to take control over their own disease and collaborate more effectively with their doctors. The advent of the IoT (Internet of Things) and 5G mobile technologies can support patients in this direction. Since a snapshot of the overall patient's condition during a regular follow-up visit may not represent the every day reality of the patient, the advice given under these conditions may not be that effective. However, if hard data on the patient's motoric and cognitive performance were available “theragnostics” might be much more effective and efficient and a typical flare-up of the condition might be recognized much earlier - or even anticipated. Health 4.0 is the translation of Industrie 4.0 design principles into the health domain [36]. Health 4.0 is based on the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of cyber-physical systems to connect the physical and the virtual world. The use of smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors and cyber-physical systems in the management of MS could optimize the accuracy and allow for a preci- e mapping of symptoms over time which is an inevitable prerequisite for personalization of care. Ideally captured data would be processed in real time in order to flag problems up to the care team and on an individual basis anticipate motoric and / or cognitive deficits in an attempt to compensate for neurological deficits. 5G networks are expected to provide the infrastructure and ease in supporting various parameters recording on a real time basis. Relevant clinical studies may further highlight the need of information communication technology in MS management, thus contributing to the overall improvement of patent's quality of life (QoL). This is an absolute necessity for a variable, fluctuating and largely unpredictable disease such as MS.},

abstract={The consequences of the exploitation of natural resources are evident in the current bad environmental conditions. For this reason, governments have implemented realtime environmental measurement systems and they have applied strategies focused to restrict the physical activities and avoid futures health problem. Even, in critical cases, the governments take measures to stop the movement of motor vehicles when the threshold of World Health Organization (WHO) is exceeded. The governmental measurement systems are limited because of high cost and they are typically located in big cities with few points of measure losing a lot of information in the uncovered areas. This work presents the development and implementation of a low cost georeferenced air-pollution measurement system that offers information of particulate measurement PM1, PM2.5 y PM10 by scatter. In addition, the system measures the levels of ozone concentration, and atmospheric variables such as temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. The whole system is connected to a low cost microprocessor with integrated Wi-Fi allowing to send the data to the cloud in real-time using MQTTprotocol, and thus the data can be georeferenced and published on an open access platform, used to the Internet of Things (IoT), for the acquisition and visualization of the data. In this way, the information is public and the residents of a particular area can look for the nearest measure of the environmental conditions. This work proposes a simple and cheap way to implement a measurement system allowing it to be easily replicated. The consequences for the health because of exposition to pollutants are serious, it implies a public policy issues with direct effect in the economy and development of cities. Because of all this, the air-pollution measurement systems should be improved and available in many more points. Governments can make public policy decisions about the environment using the information from systems like the prop- sed in this work.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things relies on ad-hoc connections, which also requires an on-demand approach to the negotiation of security parameters. We propose a new approach to shared key derivation for Body Area Networks (BANs). Body area networks are quickly becoming increasingly important in the world of healthcare with wide application in the treatment and monitoring of chronic patients using on-body devices. Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys. We show that these measurements results in derived keys that are unpredictable and exhibit significant difference with previous keys. This is an improvement over existing schemes where keys vary for different hosts but tend to be similar over time.},

Internet of Things (IoT) allows caring of people from remote locations with the help of integration of wireless sensor network with internet. Different sensors are used to measure different health parameters. Processing of smart health care data in an efficient manner is necessary. Slight time variation causes severe effect such as loss of life. In IoT, delay occur in processing large volume of sensor data in real time. Energy spent by the sensors also affected by processing delay. Because sensors spent energy in idle state. To reduce delay in processing smart health care data, Multi core technology is included with IoT. SixLoWPAN is the technique used to connect low configured devices with internet. In this paper, Task Level Parallelism (TLP) is applied to process different health parameters in parallel. TLP utilizes the available resources in optimal way. It makes our system as more efficient. The proposed system improves performance upto 65.5%. Efficient system also reduces power consumption of the devices. This will increase the life time of the sensor network.},

By learning data from several mobile sensors, we detect nearness of the human body to a mobile device in a three-dimensional space with no physical contact with the device for non-invasive health diagnostics. We show that the human body generates wave patterns that interact with other naturally occurring ambient signals that could be measured by mobile sensors, such as, temperature, humidity, magnetic field, acceleration, gravity, and light. This interaction consequentially alters the patterns of the naturally occurring signals, and thus, exhibits characteristics that could be learned to predict the nearness of the human body to a mobile device, hence provide diagnostic information for medical practitioners. Our prediction technique achieved 88.75% accuracy and 88.3% specificity.},

abstract={Also in western countries, air pollution is a big health risk, additionally resulting in huge economic damage. At present, air pollution is mainly monitored with highly accurate equipment but at extremely low spatial resolution. Overcoming the disadvantage of the low spatial resolution, and building a wireless network of sensors, can open doors to new applications, both to better understand the sources and the health effects of air pollution. We review selected state-of-the-art projects to supply the reader with an overview over current applications that were enabled by the use of new sensors, wireless sensor networks (WSNWs) and information technology. We will critically asses the spatial and temporal resolution, the sensor accuracy and the results. We will show that the crucial step, that is still to be done, is the development of dependable sensors. This can enable the breakthrough of existing applications. By introducing intelligent nodes, the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) can trigger new use cases. We will conclude with an outlook on our future work, by presenting novel applications to better protect citizens from the adverse health effects of air pollution and to better understand those effects. We will show that these applications require dependable sensors and WSNWs.},

abstract={WSNs are achieving significance importance in the information and communication technologies with the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT). WSNs are connected with the Internet in many industrial applications. However, energy efficiency is one of the challenging problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, an optimized location of cluster heads (CHs) for energy efficiency in a heterogeneous WSN (that consists of few energy harvesting sensors and mostly non-renewable sensors) is studied. LEACH is an effective method for clustering in a homogeneous WSN, consisting solely of non-renewable sensors with uniform energy profile. Our proposed clustering schemes suggest simple and static clustering strategy for a heterogeneous WSN with good harvesting efficiency. The proposed schemes divide the total network covered area into cells, based on different criterion. In regular grid (RG) approach, a CH is simply placed in the center of each cell. Minimax grid (MG) approach attempts to improve the lifetime of the network by placing the CH at the center of the smallest enclosing circle. K-Medoids (KM) approach first divides the network into clusters and then solves a facility location problem to assign the role of CHs to EH sensors. Simulation results show that RG, MG and KM perform better than LEACH in terms of energy consumption, and consequently, increase the lifetime of the network by upto 200% when the harvested energy is available in healthy amounts. The relative improvement of KM and MG over RG is also discussed in this paper.},

abstract={Secrecy and integrity of communication, as well as the authenticity of messages must be ensured by the security primitives and is critical element in Internet of Things (IoT). Devices in IoT applications such as smart healthcare applications deal with sensitive data of our health and daily lives and thus can execute malicious actuating commands with serious safety consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure secure communication channel establishment among the medical sensors or devices and the remote servers. In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is energy efficient.},

abstract={Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies allow the intelligent sensor systems to effectively and efficiently observe and identify human behaviour in many applications, particularly in energy consumption and healthcare sectors. One typical case is that how to use IoT technologies to understand human water use behaviour for improved and sustained hygiene practice. Traditionally, static behaviour intervention models are widely utilised to simulate behaviour intervention process over time. These static methods can predict targeted human behaviour reasonably well, but lack of capabilities on understanding and responding behaviour change process in IoT environments. In this study, the authors proposed a dynamic behaviour intervention model for predicting household water user behaviour for improved hygiene practices. This model is based on an expanded theory of planned behaviour (ETPB), and adopted structure equation model approach and control engineering concept. A case study of household water consumption model using artificial neural network is utilised to evaluate intervention trend of proposed ETPB dynamic behaviour model with system parameter identification. The ETPB dynamic model has been proved to be effective for modelling human behaviour intervention process.},

abstract={The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.},

abstract={Localisation is an essential and important research issue in Internet of Things (IoT). Most localisation schemes focus on outdoor IoT. However, indoor IoT is required in some applications such as target detection and tracking, and emerging smarter healthcare. As such, localisation approaches designed for indoor IoT are necessary. Note that the smarter healthcare emerges at an unprecedented speed while few localisation schemes can be directly exploited for them with accuracy guarantee. In this study, the authors propose a wearable indoor localisation approach to improve the localisation accuracy of previous work. In this approach, the wearable devices embedded into person are used to realise their displacement vector in mobile environments, thus estimating their own locations. In addition, the authors propose a walking prediction mechanism to increase localisation accuracy. The real-world experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves lower localisation error in various moving speeds.},

The aim of this paper is to propose SC-IAQM model for indoor air quality monitoring in a smart community which is introduced as an application of Internet of Things (IoT). SC-IAQM model provides low latency of critical data packets with high priority as well as reduces energy consumption of the network. Common indoor air pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compound, Particulate Matter and Methane are involved in this research. If the levels of these pollutants exceed the defined limits, sending the emergency services would be an option to deal with critical situation locally under the management of community center. Our experiment with NS-2 shows the effectiveness of SC-IAQM model in reducing the average energy consumption as well as end-to-end delay of critical data packets.},

abstract={In the Internet-of-Things environment, it is critical to bridge the gap between business decision-making and real-time factory data to let companies transfer from condition-based maintenance service to predictive maintenance service. Condition monitoring systems have been widely applied to many industries to acquire operation and equipment related data, through which machine health state can be evaluated. One of the challenges of predicting future machine health lies in extracting the right features that are correlated well with the fault progression/degradation. We propose an enhanced restricted Boltzmann machine with a novel regularization term to automatically generate features that are suitable for remaining useful life prediction. The regularization term tries to maximize the trendability of the output features, which potentially better represent the degradation pattern of a system. The proposed method is benchmarked with regular restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm and principal component analysis. The generated features are used as input to a similarity-based method for life prediction. Run-to-failure datasets collected from two rotating systems are used for validation.},

abstract={Ontology-based applications are becoming more and more popular and are usually domain-specific (e.g., eHealth or domotic). Designing ontologies and semantic-based applications manually is tedious and cumbersome for non-technical expert or semantic web beginners. Internet of Things (IoT) is a new field aiming to connect the physical world surrounded by devices such as sensors to the web to automatically interact with them and build innovative applications. The main challenges are to automate as much as possible the tasks of: (1) reusing the background knowledge previously designed by domain experts, (2) facilitating the tasks of IoT developers willing to integrate semantic web technologies into their applications, and (3) designing interoperable semantic-based IoT applications. Stemming from Linked Open Data and Linked Open Vocabularies, we designed Linked Open Vocabularies for Internet of Things (LOV4IoT), a catalogue of ontologies/datasets/rules relevant for IoT available online. LOV4IoT has been extended with more domains and ontology-based projects, a semantic-based dataset and a bot to enhance automation, and web services. Moreover, we demonstrate several use cases of the LOV4IoT dataset: (1) building Semantic Web of Things applications, (2) extracting frequent terms used in existing ontologies, and (3) stakeholders who can exploit, reuse and combine domain ontologies. Finally, we evaluated this dataset with users who exploit this dataset for their own purposes.},

Moving forward we expect to see their dominance in automotive applications. At the same time, we are seeing increased interest in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect trillions of sensors. We are preparing for Internet of Everything (IoE) applications where people, process, data and devices are going to be connected through new generation of electronics which are not possible today. Therefore, our research is focused on hybrid integration of heterogeneous materials, processes and devices to build free form (flexible, stretchable, reconfigurable in shape and size) interactive and high-performance electronics and systems for smart living and a sustainable future focusing on healthcare, water, food and environment. For scientific exploration, we develop integration strategy to make collective use of the materials, processes and device architecture leveraging multidisciplinary tracks of electrical engineering, material science, bioengineering, computer science and engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering (focusing plants and marine science) and health science. As engineering tool, we use CMOS technology extensively due to its industrial relevance, maturity and reliability for rapid tech transfer.

So the novelty of this IP is that it enables storage class memory which stands invisible to core as executable memory for low to medium sized IoT SoC's. Currently the devices available in the market have to be synced in to cloud or a device with higher memory bandwidth frequently as the inbuilt SRAM/DDR memory have limited executable memory space.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to connect things of the physical world and of the cyber world to make human life more productive, safe, healthy, and comfortable by solving numerous challenges related to the environment, energy, urbanization, industry, logistics, and transportation, to name a few. Consequently, IoT has been an important topic of standardization in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in different Study Groups. ITU-T Study Group 20 was established recently to further promote coordinated progress of global IoT technologies, services, and applications. This article first presents a review of IoT related activities in ITU, and then describes a number of key requirements the IoT infrastructure should satisfy to make it economically and technologically deployable for useful services and applications. It presents several key networking concepts, such as software-defined networking, information-centric networking, and ID-based communication, while highlighting the prospective technologies that are worth further study in ITU.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an ubiquitous concept where physical objects are connected over the internet and are provided with unique identifiers to enable their self-identification to other devices and the ability to transmit data over the network. Sensor nodes along with their heterogeneous nature are the main part of the IoT and may act as internet hosts or clients. Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication. By using this protocol, resource-constrained nodes can also benefit from the same security functionalities that are typical of unconstrained domains, without however having to execute computationally intensive operations. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic operations of constrained nodes to the neighboring trusted nodes or devices. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is sufficiently energy efficient.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a paradigm that connects devices and objects through the network to share information. Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is gaining a mountainous attention because of its noteworthy impact on everyday life of the people. Billions of things are expected to be a part of IoT paradigm in the near future, providing enormous applications ranging from home automation, smart environment, health care, etc. One of the major hurdles for IoT to be effective with existing network architectures is a prolonged and seamless connectivity between the things and with the end user. Due to heterogeneity in the characteristics of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it has become a most prominent technology to bind the things with the Internet and with the end users. Wireless Sensor Networks are self healing and active in nature, that is, they can sense, instruct, request, respond and can easily be adopted to Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN). Addressing scheme in Wireless Sensor networks has to be foreseen if it has to be deployed in Internet of Things paradigm. This paper proposes a discrete cluster based addressing scheme on IEEE 802.15.4 standard for all the things included in a Wireless Sensor Network based IoT applications. Results have been evaluated with existing IPv6 based addressing and it is found that cluster based addressing scheme on the traditionally used IEEE 802.15.4 communication channel suits well over the end to end IPv6 communication channel.},

Towards the accomplishment of the above requirements, the contemporary technological trends leaded to the IoT and Cloud convergence. This combination created the approach of federated Cloud-IoT architectures. The Cloud-IoT architectural vision is paving the way to the vital step, beyond the IoT cognitive capabilities, that refers to the IoT world leveraging cloud principles. For the success of the deployment of such innovative and high-performance solutions, the introduction and the exploitation of 5G technological principles will empower the way forward. Towards this direction, this paper presents a federated architecture combined by distributed Edge Cloud-IoT platforms, that enables the semantic-based service combination and provisioning. The 5G technological features, such as low-latency, zero-losses, high-bitrates are studied and proposed for the empowerment of the federation of the Edge Cloud-IoT architectures.

The ubiquitous smart devices can generate enormous amount of data which along with real-time analytics can drive unprecedented innovations, trigger new business models and at some point deeply touch the human life. As IoT's start driving mission critical applications, the need to pro-actively monitor and manage their performance-availability-scalability levels becomes paramount. Failure in doing so can lead to a direct impact on business and now to human life as IoT's get increasingly used in healthcare.

In particular, we adopt and present the information economics approach with its applications in IoT. We first review existing economic models developed for IoT services. Then we outline two important topics of information economics that are pertinent to IoT, i.e., the value of information and proper pricing of information.

abstract={In the field of Ambient Assisted Living a limited amount of research aims at supporting caregivers that work with people with disabilities in assisted living facilities (ALFs). In fact, research activities on healthcare support systems in AAL mainly focus on improving the quality of life for people in their own homes or supporting nurses and doctors in hospitals. This paper explores and applies the Internet of Things paradigm in the ALFs context. In particular, we present the design, the implementation, and the experimental evaluation of a system capable of supporting the daily activities of healthcare assistants that operate in ALFs for people with physical or cognitive disabilities. The solution combines wearable and mobile technologies to improve assistance requests and anomaly detection. With this healthcare support system, caregivers can be automatically alerted of potentially hazardous situations that happen to the inhabitants while these are out of sight. Furthermore, inhabitants can require assistance instantly and from any point of the facility. We evaluated the system in two ways. We performed a functional test with two professional caregivers, and we deployed the system in an ALF in Italy for 36 hours, collecting the opinions of the involved caregivers and inhabitants.},

Considering the future vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), many requirements and challenges rise to the design and implementation of such systems. Bridging the gap between sensor nodes on the human body and the Internet becomes a challenging task in terms of reliable communications. Additionally, the systems will not only have to provide functionality, but also be highly secure. In this paper, we provide a survey on existing communication protocols and security issues related to pervasive health monitoring, describing their limitations, challenges, and possible solutions.

abstract={Internet-of-Things architecture aims to provide smart connectivity not only with existing computers, but also with new context-aware computing resources, extending soon beyond von Neumann devices for the purpose of mining, prediction, and control of cyber and physical components. These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms. Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems. By carefully analyzing the spatiotemporal workload characteristics of the NMPC problems, we propose the design of an efficient NoC architecture. Our proposed NoC architecture achieves up to 29% improvement in latency and 28% improvement in energy dissipation over the conventional mesh NoC-based counterpart.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a concept that seeks to provide most autonomy, security, and health services for elderly people offering technology solutions to them. When AAL applications are provided through the Internet, it is possible to create new applications involving the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The AAL-IoT applications can be used to event detection (such as fall detection or blood pressure) and send messages to an emergency service or a family member through the Internet. The event detection is frequently performed by sensor networks. However, these networks can present some difficulties to provide the high quality of service required for AAL-IoT applications. Thus, this paper proposes a new routing metric that considers information about the nodes and their connections, seeking the network performance enhancement for AAL-IoT. The proposed metric is an additive composition of information about link quality and nodes energy. The results obtained through simulation show that the proposed routing metric can increase the network performance to better meet the AAL-IoT requirements.},

In this paper, we present a novel sensor agnostic model SensIPro to perform robust unsupervised analysis of sensor data to support scalable analytics, a prime need for Internet of things (IoT).

Our proposed sensor analytics model SensIPro automates analysis of outliers based on inferring signal characteristics of diverse sensors from different IoT applications like healthcare, smart energy, smart transport. We apply relevant time-series algorithms using statistical analysis, information theoretic measure for sensor data analytics. We measure similarity/dissimilarity of the time series sensor data and correlate with detected outliers. Our algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of sensor data type and metadata. We present results and analysis based on real life heterogeneous sensor data sets. Obtained results further prove efficacy of the proposed mechanism.},

abstract={With the advent of nanotechnology, concepts related to the Internet of Things, such as the Internet of NanoThings and Internet of Bio-NanoThings (IoBNT) have also emerged in the classical literature. The main concern of this paper is the IoBNT, which projects the prospective application domain where the activities of very tiny, biocompatible, and non-intrusive devices operating in an in-body nanonetwork can be monitored and controlled through the Internet. In this paper, we present an illustrative scenario and system model of an IoBNT for application in an advanced healthcare delivery system. To address one of the major challenges of the IoBNT, we present an exemplary architecture and model of a bio-cyber interface for connecting the conventional electromagnetic-based Internet to the biochemical signaling-based bionanonetwork. The bio-cyber interface is designed and modeled by employing biological concepts, such as the responsiveness of certain biomolecules to thermal and light stimuli, and the bioluminescence phenomenon of some biochemical reactions. The analysis in this paper focuses on the system that comprises the bio-cyber interface and the information propagation network of the blood vessel that leads to the in-body nanonetwork location. The effects of the system and design parameters associated with the IoBNT models presented are numerically evaluated.},

pages={60-70},
abstract={This article is a single-source introduction to the emerging concept of smart cities. It can be used for familiarizing researchers with the vast scope of research possible in this application domain. The smart city is primarily a concept, and there is still not a clear and consistent definition among practitioners and academia. As a simplistic explanation, a smart city is a place where traditional networks and services are made more flexible, efficient, and sustainable with the use of information, digital, and telecommunication technologies to improve the city's operations for the benefit of its inhabitants. Smart cities are greener, safer, faster, and friendlier. The different components of a smart city include smart infrastructure, smart transportation, smart energy, smart health care, and smart technology. These components are what make the cities smart and efficient. Information and communication technology (ICT) are enabling keys for transforming traditional cities into smart cities. Two closely related emerging technology frameworks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data (BD), make smart cities efficient and responsive. The technology has matured enough to allow smart cities to emerge. However, there is much needed in terms of physical infrastructure, a smart city, the digital technologies translate into better public services for inhabitants and better use of resources while reducing environmental impacts. One of the formal definitions of the smart city is the following: a city "connecting the physical infrastructure, the information-technology infrastructure, the social infrastructure, and the business infrastructure to leverage the collective intelligence of the city". Another formal and comprehensive definition is "a smart sustainable city is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it- meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects". Any combination of various smart components can make cities smart. A city need not have all the components to be labeled as smart. The number of smart components depends on the cost and available technology.},

This paper is on potential smart cities applications as applied to the domains of smart transport, smart tourism and recreation, smart health, ambient-assisted living, crime prevention and community safety, governance, monitoring and infrastructure, disaster management, environment management, refuse collection and sewer management, smart homes and smart energy. These smart cities applications support the future vision of cities, which aim at exploiting ICTs, namely internet of things technologies (IoT), for value-added service delivery. Furthermore, the paper presents a technical solution for energy control and comfort in a home for proof of concept of a smart city infrastructure application.

However, digitisation of identification, tracking and monitoring of patients remains a challenge in rural areas of Africa, not to mention of associated power and internet connectivity constraints. This paper proposes a general architecture for monitoring of growth and vital parameters of under-five children. The system alerts medical personnel in real time about under-weight cases or abnormal readings of vital parameters in order to take further medical diagnosis. Furthermore, the system saves the child's personalised measurements to a cloud-based data store in real time. Preliminary tests of network performance of the IoT application design resulted in an average latency of 1.7s and system availability of 99.96%, thus validating its usability.},

abstract={On-board diagnostics will play a crucial role in the emerging era of the Internet of Things. With billions of devices deployed, traditional manual preventive maintenance approaches will be cost prohibitive. As we make these small autonomous devices intelligent, it is critical that we also give them a very advanced ability to assess and report their own health. Of course, on-board diagnostics are not a new concept. What is new with the Internet of Things is the extreme economic leverage that the on-board diagnostics will have due to the huge number of devices to be developed. If the on-board diagnostics perform poorly, the resulting surge of support costs could be enough to drive the organization deploying the Internet of Things systems out of business. As an organization gets ready to release millions of a certain type of Internet of Things device into the wild, how confident can the organization be that the on-board diagnostics will really perform as expected? As it turns out, we can learn from history. In the 1960s and 1970s, the mainframe and telecommunications industries developed powerful statistical methods for answering this exact question for the large mission-critical systems that they were deploying.},

Machine-to-Machine (M2M) middleware standards are driving the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications by providing autonomic interoperability. However, standards remain opaque and difficult to interpret, throttling implementation. In this work, we report the design and development of an ETSI M2M Gateway (GW) on a mobile device, instantiated in a smartphone. We describe our reasoning in interpreting the standard for the varied implementation challenges faced. Further, we develop libraries to ease the deployment of IoT applications using the ETSI M2M ecosystem with reduced development costs. Finally, we validated the implementation with a mobile e-health pilot with 10 participants during 3 weeks.},

abstract={Establishing promising and efficient key distribution is the cornerstone of security when applying cryptographic methods to guard the privacy of smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, when using conventional key distribution methods in real-time mobile services, it is usually deficient to build multiple channels with strong security simultaneously on a single data server. Therefore, we focus our research on collecting or monitoring real-time and remote data, which is commonly observed in the health care field of the IoT. In this research, there are difficulties to apply the conventional key distribution approaches during interactions when considering both security and efficiency. Moreover, when preserving personal privacy, anonymity is also important in key distribution processes. We design a system of real-time mobile services and the related security requirements in this paper, and apply a novel and interesting Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (IBKEM) to instantiate our system and achieve anonymous key distribution with only one-pass communication for mobile clients in batch. Our instantiated system demonstrates both strong security and practice.},

Cities can be perceived as an ecosystem of "things" which citizens daily interact with: street furniture, public buildings, transportation, monuments, public lighting as well as personal smartphones. Thanks to recent advances in ICT such things can be considered always interconnected also providing sensing and actuating facilities according to the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems models. Creating smart services that exploit such a complex infrastructure is a fundamental and current challenge. To this end, aim of this paper is the design and implementation of the Software Defined Cities approach: a Cloud-based infrastructure that, starting from the well known concept of Software Defined paradigms, is able to transform this complex ecosystem in a simple and "programmable" environment where municipalities, companies, scientists, and citizens can easily collaborate in developing innovative smart services. The overall architecture is presented focusing on both the function virtualization and infrastructure aspects also giving details about the software stacks used (e.g., Open Stack) while a use case is laid out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.},

A capacitance change of ten times is observed when the relative humidity changes from 50% to 90%.

abstract={Together with the development of technologies such as those for ubiquitous computing, data mining, Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the concepts of smart cities and mobile health (m-Health) have emerged. Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen. Besides the description of the application, the main contribution of the article is the analysis of the emerging privacy issues of the proposed application and the discussion of possible countermeasures.},

abstract={The recent technological advances related to computing, storage, cloud, networking and the unstoppable deployment of end-user devices, are all coining the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). IoT embraces a wide set of heterogeneous services in highly impacting societal sectors, such as Healthcare, Smart Transportation or Media delivery, all of them posing a diverse set of requirements, including real time response, low latency, or high capacity. In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics. To that end, in this paper, we introduce and formulate the QoS-aware service allocation problem for CFC architectures as an integer optimization problem, whose solution minimizes the latency experienced by the services while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the capacity requirements.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is formed by smart objects and services to interact in real time, and that are deployed in various applications such as home monitoring, healthcare, and smart cities. However, security concerns should not be overlooked since an adversary could exploit the vulnerabilities in the design of some secure protocols. To this aim, in this paper we focus in particular on broadcast authentication in resource constrained devices. This security service is still in its infancy when devices are deployed in unattended environments. We propose a new authentication mechanism based on the state of the art protocol μTESLA, that aims to reduce the delay of forged packets in the receivers buffer, by efficiently computing the key disclosure delay. Then, we integrate this mechanism to two protocols of state of the art LEAP and LEAP++. Furthermore, we assess the feasibility of our solution with a thorough simulation study, taking into account the energy consumption, the delay of forged packets, and the authentication delay.},

abstract={Ensuring interoperability in the future Internet of Things applications can be a challenging task, especially in mission-critical applications such as Health Monitoring Systems. Existing low-power wireless network architectures are designed in isolated networks, and ensure a satisfying level of performance in homogeneous networks. However, with co-existence of different low-power networks, the interoperability related problems arise. To bridge this gap in this paper, we study various protocol stacks (i.e., Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN and IEEE 802.15.6), and explain their specific features. Furthermore, we provide a generic protocol stack design that facilitates multiple radios with different protocol stacks, regardless of being IP-based or non-IP-based networks. We see this approach as a possibility to enhance network performance in terms of reliability, timeliness, and security, while providing higher levels of scalability and connectivity.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is now transitioning from theory to practice. This means that a lot of data will be generated and the management of this data is going to be a big challenge. To transform IoT into reality and build upon realistic and more useful services, better resource management is required at the perception layer. In this regard, Fog computing plays a very vital role. With the advent of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) and remote healthcare and monitoring, quick response time and latency minimization are required. However, the receiving nodes have a very fluctuating behavior in resource consumption especially if they are mobile. Fog, a localized cloud placed close to the underlying IoTs, provides the means to cater such issues by analyzing the behavior of the nodes and estimating resources accordingly. Similarly, Service Level Agreement (SLA) management and meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements also become issues. In this paper, we devise a methodology, referred to as MEdia FOg Resource Estimation (MeFoRE), to provide resource estimation on the basis of service give-up ratio, also called Relinquish Rate (RR), and enhance QoS on the basis of previous Quality of Experience (QoE) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) records. The algorithms are implemented using CloudSim and applied on real IoT traces on the basis of Amazon EC2 resource pricing.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.},

abstract={Smart Cities are a key application domain for the Internet of Things (IoT), and it is coming nearer everyday through pilot trials and deployments in various cities around the world. In Porto, Portugal, a city-wide IoT Living Lab emerged after we deployed several testbeds, e.g. harbour and a city-scale vehicular networks, and carried out various experiments with the SenseMyCity crowdsensor. In this paper, we discuss how a standard Machine-to-Machine (M2M) middleware is a key enabler of our e-health platform and SenseMyCity crowdsensor, powered by the use of smartphones as M2M gateways. M2M standards provided by ETSI/oneM2M are essential for a paradigm shift, aiming at making the IoT truly interoperable without the need for human intervention. In this work, we map two applications that rely on the role of a smartphone as a gateway, which acts as a proxy to connect legacy devices to the IoT using a standard middleware. We illustrate the advantages of using M2M, and, as a proof-of-concept, we measure and quantify the energy savings obtained, showing improvements of smartphones' battery life.},

abstract={One of the central research challenges in the Internet of Things and Ubiquitous Computing domains is how users can be enabled to “program” their personal and industrial smart environments by combining services that are provided by devices around them. We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},

abstract={The IEEE 802.11ah technology, targeting vast amount of use cases within the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) expansion, is currently being finalized. This IoT/M2M connectivity technology is deployed at the sub-1 GHz ISM bands, that are subject to various coexistence regulations set by the authorities. In Europe, devices in the Sub-1 GHz ISM bands must comply with the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%, provided that they also support Listen Before Talk (LBT) and Adaptive Frequency Agility (AFA) features. In this article we investigate the challenges of such duty cycle limitation and its effect on the IEEE 802.11ah network performance from the uplink transmission perspective, considering typical use cases characterized by different traffic models. We first derive the theoretical maximum duty cycles of both an individual station and an individual AP assuming full-buffer or saturated traffic. Then, with emphasis on more practical uses cases, such as home/building automation and healthcare, where the traffic of an individual station or node is strongly unsaturated, we analyze the IEEE 802.11ah network performance without and with the 2.8% maximum duty cycle limitation. The obtained results show IEEE 802.11ah networks can provide efficient support for the most important use cases such as sensor networking, home automation and healthcare, despite the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%. This shows that IEEE 802.11ah is one of the most prominent and scalable IoT/M2M connectivity technology, that can enable different types of IoT applications, even in the presence of the tight coexistence requirements at the ISM band.},

IoT applications such as smart grid and power systems, e-health, and body monitoring applications along with large-scale environmental and industrial monitoring are increasingly generating large amounts of data that can conveniently be analyzed through cloud service provisioning. However, the nature of these applications mandates the use of secure and privacy-preserving implementation of services that ensures the integrity of data without any unwarranted exposure. This article explores the unique challenges and issues within this context of enabling secure cloud-based data analytics for the IoT. Three main applications are discussed in detail, with solutions outlined based on the use of fully homomorphic encryption systems to achieve data security and privacy over cloud-based analytical phases. The limitations of existing technologies are discussed and models proposed with regard to achieving high efficiency and accuracy in the provisioning of analytic services for encrypted data over a cloud platform.},

abstract={In this paper, context-aware interactive mobile-health (m-health) system (ImHS) provides real-time, two-way communication between diabetes patients and caregivers by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology. When a diabetic patient records abnormal blood sugar values during measurement, the ImHS sends a reminder to the patient and caregivers, motivating behavior change and improving the quality of chronic care. The ImHS features user-friendly interfaces for patients, family, and professional caregivers that lets them rapidly understand the patient's health status. In this study, the authors look at ImHS use in diabetes care. However, the ImHS can be easily adapted for integration into other healthcare systems.},

abstract={In a world deploying an Internet of Things, sensors and actuators are owned, accessed, and activated by a plethora of individuals and organizations. Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of "things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we "acquire" and "distribute" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions. The scheme puts users (including organizational entities) in the center of control over the access to their collections of sensory data. In our paper, we describe a deployment of these ideas for health care, smart cities, and autonomous cars.},

abstract={Many solutions to important societal problems relating to the environment, health care, transportation, etc. seek to utilize the promises of the Internet of Things (IoT), where sensing, computation, and actuation merge the physical world with the computational world. To date, many such solutions have focused on a single problem domain and require dedicated sensor and actuator infrastructure. This vertical integration makes the development of innovative, novel solutions costly and difficult to deploy. An architectural approach to addressing this challenge is to enable horizontal integration, where sensors and actuators from different applications can interconnect with any computational IoT application. In order to isolate complexities and to support heterogeneous systems and software, it is necessary to provide clear abstractions. We present such abstractions in the form of a layered protocol architecture that describes the necessary interfaces. Beyond technical challenges for horizontal integration, this paper also addresses network economic considerations since the various entities owning and operating sensors and actuators need suitable economic motivation to participate in such an approach. We believe that this work provides a conceptual foundation for future, scalable IoT solutions.},

abstract={Lacking better methodology is one main factor that prevents remote healthcare application development using wearable sensors. Sensor devices and data heterogeneity are two additional factors. Integrating devices is a challenge due to lack of interoperability between APIs, protocols and their data formats, despite they relate to same device type. ANT+, a proprietary protocol, strengthens the goals for Internet of Things (IoT) by supporting device interoperability. Data diversity demands robust techniques during its transferal and storage. We miss a general guide to efficiently acquire and asynchronously store sensor data in a flexible schema repository. For a real-time web environment the methodology must address the issues such as, devices connectivity, unique general message interpreter, data transfer and storage. In this article a methodology is presented and supported with a prototype. A computer user can use it to acquire sensor data to transmit and store using a windows service.},

Smart cities can benefit of the ICT, however it needs sophisticate mechanisms and appropriate software technologies to collect, store, analyze and visualize the data from the city environment and the citizens. The urban environments are of the main data generators worldwide. In the context of smart cities, there is an abundance of data that can be mined by applying data analytic techniques, in order to define services that increase citizens' quality of life. There are different data sources, like the traditional information held by public institutions (data about the traffic, the health care, etc.), the information generated by the citizens (using their smartphones, etc.), sensor systems on the city (camera networks, smart meters, etc.), in the context of the Internet of Things, etc. [1,4,10].},

abstract={Nowadays there is a rich diversity of sleep monitoring systems available on the market. They promise to offer information about sleep quality of the user by recording a limited number of vital signals, mainly heart rate and body movement. Typically, fitness trackers, smart watches, smart shirts, smartphone applications or patches do not provide access to the raw sensor data. Moreover, the sleep classification algorithm and the agreement ratio with the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG) are not disclosed. Some commercial systems record and store the data on the wearable device, but the user needs to transfer and import it into specialised software applications or return it to the doctor, for clinical evaluation of the data set. Thus an immediate feedback mechanism or the possibility of remote control and supervision are lacking. Furthermore, many such systems only distinguish between sleep and wake states, or between wake, light sleep and deep sleep. It is not always clear how these stages are mapped to the four known sleep stages: REM, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3-4. [1] The goal of this research is to find a reduced complexity method to process a minimum number of bio vital signals, while providing accurate sleep classification results. The model we propose offers remote control and real time supervision capabilities, by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This paper focuses on the data processing method and the sleep classification logic. The body sensor network representing our data acquisition system will be described in a separate publication. Our solution showed promising results and a good potential to overcome the limitations of existing products. Further improvements will be made and subjects with different age and health conditions will be tested.},

abstract={With the growth in elderly population in Singapore, healthcare expenditure and prevalence of age-related illnesses are expected to increase. Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) employs smart devices as its building blocks for developing a ubiquitous communication framework. It thus supports a wide variety of application domains, including public safety, healthcare, education, and public transportation. While offering a novel communication paradigm, IoT finds its requirements closely connected to the security issues. The role of security following the fact that a new type of devices known as wearables constitute an emerging area. This paper delivers an applicability study of the state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives for wearable IoT devices, including the pairing-based cryptography. Pairing-based schemes are well-recognized as fundamental enablers for many advanced cryptographic applications, such as privacy protection and identity-based encryption. To deliver a comprehensive view on the computational power of modern wearable devices (smart phones, watches, and embedded devices), we perform an evaluation of a variety of them utilizing bilinear pairing for real-time communication. In order to deliver a complete picture, the obtained bilinear pairing results are complemented with performance figures for classical cryptography (such as block ciphers, digital signatures, and hash functions). Our findings show that wearable devices of today have the needed potential to efficiently operate with cryptographic primitives in real time. Therefore, we believe that the data provided during this research would shed light on what devices are more suitable for certain cryptographic operations.},

Among existing systems, there is none robust system that can act as a bridge between different systems to facilitate knowledge sharing, so as to empower the detection and prediction capabilities of them. These systems cannot use the data and knowledge of other similar systems due to the complexity involved in sharing data between them. Storing the information is also a challenge due to a high volume of sensor data generated by each sensor. The proposed HEAL model is a platform that provides services to developers to leverage the previously processed similar data and the corresponding detected symptoms.

The evolution of the information and communication technologies (ICT) or artificial intelligence (AI) allowed the creation of new types of services involving electronic devices with huge potential. The emergence of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) is one of such potential example. Combining the IPA concept with the recent paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT), offers new possibilities and new services to end users, since they could learn more about other entities present in the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a novel mobile gateway solution for a ubiquitous mobile health scenario, in which information gathered from a body sensor network (BSN) is used by an IPA belonging to another person, typically mentioned to as caretaker. The mobile gateway receives real time information related to location, heart rate, and possible falls of the monitored person and acts as a communication channel between the BSN sensors and the IPA platform. Furthermore, the paper presents a performance evaluation study of the proposed mobile IoT-based gateway demonstrating and validating its feasibility.},

abstract={The future of ambient assisted living (AAL) especially eHealthcare almost depends on the smart objects that are part of the Internet of things (IoT). In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.},

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time responses. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data has to be uploaded to the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, the cloud on the edge of the network, known as Fog or Micro Datacenter (MDC), plays an important role. Fog resides between the underlying Internet of Things (IoTs) and the mega datacenter cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. To achieve this, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we propose in this paper. Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can stop using resources at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management through Fog computing, we take into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. With the intent of showing practical implications of our method, we implemented it on Crawdad real trace and Amazon EC2 pricing. Based on various services, differentiated through Amazon's price plans and historical record of Cloud Service Customers (CSCs), the model determines the amount of resources to be allocated. More loyal CSCs get better services, while for the contrary case, the provider reserves resources cautiously.},

abstract={In Internet of Things (IoT) environment, IoT devices are limited to power supply, CPU capacity, memory, etc. and have a constrained network performance such as bandwidth, wireless channel, throughput, payload, etc., the resources of IoT devices however can be shared by other IoT devices. Specially, in IoT healthcare service, the way of management and interoperability of patient-related and device information are very important. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of an IoT healthcare system using ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD (Personal Healthcare Device) and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) standards in order to enhance the interoperability and reduce the data loss between the devices and measured information while in transmission. To demonstrate the proposed architecture, we implement comparative performance evaluation between HTTP and CoAP in terms of the number of packets in one transaction, the number of packets by data loss rate in during transmission and a syntax usage between XML and JSON.},

It has changes the world in the terms of predicting customer's behaviour. Another buzz word these days is social networks and relation between two of these is very obvious yet complicated. Both Big Data and Social network are interdependent to each other as most of the data is generating from social networking sites but not all the Big Data is useful. The actual challenge of Big Data is not collecting it but managing it and making sense out of it. While working with Big Data, most crucial part is to predicting that whether it will bring more money than spent on its storage and maintenance or not. Several tools are being designed for better understanding of huge data to make better business. Researchers and practitioners are trying to look into the future of big data so that more and more benefit can be taken out of the large amount of data. Hadoop MapReduce is getting prominent in the field of Big Data. Big Data is being used in several research areas related to health-care, location based services, satellite information usage as well as online advertising and retail marketing.

abstract={We always make efforts to predict our future from the past and the present, since the prediction can make great changes in our life, especially in the fields of science and technology. Many organizations in the globe have surveys and announces emerging or disruptive technologies every year. Of course, they have developed their own processes to achieve the goal, but the insights of experts from related domains are usually absolute. In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results. We named this approach as Chi(Computer Human Interacting)-Delphi method for technology foresight. As Web goes to connect machine intelligences in the era of Internet of Things, the collaboration between human intelligence and machine intelligence will be eventually the next great wave for predicting the future.},

abstract={There has been a recent attempt by the researchers to leverage the widespread usage of small sensor nodes and integrate them with cloud technology for building an environment for Internet of Things. While some applications have already been developed to transmit the data from physical sensors to cloud environment, we propose to create and include virtual sensors, i.e. abstractions of physical sensors, in cloud that can enable on demand, pervasive, shared access to sensors. The definition and description of virtual sensors have already been presented in our earlier work. This paper presents implementation of virtual sensors at IaaS level. It provides a virtual sensor system architecture for both health and environment sensors and describes virtual sensor operations in four different stages. It provides description of APIs for sensing, processing, communication and storage at IaaS end. The virtual sensors can be used by any user application at PaaS or SaaS levels. Performance of a preliminary implementation of such virtual sensor system is also analyzed in this paper.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is nowadays increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected devices uniquely addressable, via a standard communication protocol. Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested by analyzing healthcare data sets, mainly comprises of activities including walking, running, ECG. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core™i5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. The results show that the proposed architecture efficiently analyze the massive volume of data with a maximum throughput.},

Handling the heterogeneity of such data by a distributed file management system based database such as H-Base having limitation to handle only structured form of the data. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for managing data heterogeneity in three basic types i.e. 1) centralized structured data to distributed structured data, 2) unstructured to a structured format and 3) semi-structured to a structured format. The performance of proposed method is evaluated in a real-time prototype experiment and in future we planned to compare to work on a data transform method in the specific context of health care data addressing performance metrics such as memory consumption and request per write. The experimental outcomes of the proposed system show how the processing time is reduced even when we process data of large size, thereby showing the effectiveness of presented approach.},

abstract={The constant evolution of technology has made people health conscious. The market is flooded with smart devices which track an individual's footsteps, the exercise regime followed, the calories burnt and many such health parameters. The important criterion often ignored which defines an individual's health is the food consumed. So it is imperative to constantly track what is ingested into the body and its impact on a person's health. The Smart Dietary Monitoring System (SDMS) is essentially a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that provides real time dietary scheduling information. The proposed system can track the user's dietary intake and replenish behavior through sensors. By integrating this WSN into the "Internet of Things", data can be aggregated in the cloud and analyzed using statistical methods which provide the correlation between the user's health and his dietary regime. This health data can be used to track as well as guide the user regarding his nutritional needs thus acting as an ideal health assistant.},

abstract={Wirelessly connected smart embedded devices, forming the so called Internet of Things network, have achieved unprecedented levels of diffusion as they are adopted in many application domains, ranging from goods transportation to eHealth monitoring infrastructure. As they are always inherently connected, hence exposed to attacks, and as they densely populate our daily life collecting, managing and elaborating data, security has drawn a lot of attention in the literature. In a crowded network, classical security approaches may be not adequate, since they require secret sharing or public key distribution infrastructures. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), introduced so far, are exploitable as security primitives, providing easy authentication and secure key storage mechanisms. Traditional PUF authentication schemes rely on the enrollment of some challenge/response pairs (CRPs), extracted before each device is issued, as it is not feasible to retrieve the whole CRPs set. Moreover, accomplishing such a procedure may introduce a significant overhead due to the cardinality of extracted CRPs and due to size of the device population. To avoid these issues, in this paper we exploit the knowledge of a PUF model in order to make available the whole CRPs set, and, by adopting an encryption scheme, we hide it to avoid model based attacks which can be performed on CRPs sent in clear. To this aim, we show an implementation based on the Anderson PUF and on AES, realized on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 Field Programmable Gate Array.},

abstract={Most real-world networks (including financial, health, transportation, social, citation, and sensor networks) evolve over time. Their evolution can be modeled as a series of graph snapshots that represent those networks at different points in time. Our distributed dynamic graph database, G*, provided efficient cluster-based storage and querying of graph snapshots by taking advantage of their commonalities. With the modern Internet of Things, however, the environment of continuously generated graph snapshots imbues classic challenges of data distribution with renewed significance. In response to this, we have extended G* to address these new challenges. In this paper we examine two snapshot placement schemes and their effects on query performance in a cloud / data center environment.},

abstract={Healthcare is very important factor in every body's life and Information technology is playing an important role in providing better health with number of advances. Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology. Due to its popularity in technology and internet world, IoT is rising in every field of life and so in health sector. Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. But it's still not implemented for the broad scope of Hospitals, and especially in Pakistan it's not being used for any purpose in health sector. So we need to define and provide IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS). In this paper we have presented IoT based architectural framework with context awareness for hospital management systems. We have used Context awareness as middleware above network layer to overcome the problem of data management. Moreover we did survey to investigate the decision to adopt the IoT based system in Pakistani Hospitals. Survey was questionnaire based. The accumulated results indicate that participants want to adopt this system and most of the population agreed that IoT based HMIS would provide better monitoring, communication and early diagnosis.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is construed as a broad interconnectivity of everyday devices and entities, such that their collaborative engagements can create superior externalities. It is distinguished from the "sensorweb" through the capabilities of IoT devices to operate and reason on, and with, inputs from multiple sources. In this work we postulate that vehicles have a previously unexplored role to play in driving widespread acceptance, and adoption, of mobile cloud, IoT and AAL principles, concepts and systems. We argue that, historically, deployment of new, disruptive technological paradigms has been slow and the notion of IoT devices being deeply embedded in our everyday environment, and working and collaborating to enhance and support our daily existences (Ambient Assisted Living), makes "realizing tomorrow's potential difficult. But not impossible" for industry actors. This work re-envisions common approaches to presenting AAL research and focuses on emerging and future enabler technologies and platforms that will provide direct AAL interactions and experiences for end users. The use-case and deployment scenario is that of present day and future vehicular and transportation infrastructure networks, with exemplars in the global societal challenge of healthcare for aging populations.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems have become a main part in future internet research. In IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe special tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact between the integrated devices and diverse services. Considering the healthcare research, the number of elderly people is rapidly growing and they need more support in their life. Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been established as a best communication paradigm for future internet, particularly in IoT. Based on hierarchically structured names, ICN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and provides an efficient and intelligent communication paradigm for both IoT and AAL (IoT-AAL) technologies. In this work, we design an IoT architecture for AAL via ICN approach which will effectively improve the performance of communication between the heterogeneous devices and services integrated in IoT-AAL.},

abstract={One of the most promising instantiations of the Internet of Things (IoT) are mobile health (mHealth) systems, which promise to deliver intelligent health monitoring and assisted living as well as advanced and integrated health services. To realize the full potential of these services, fragmented and heterogeneous data that is generated by different segments of the system need to be consolidated in order to support high-quality processes. This paper proposes a tiered data integration scheme for mHealth systems that works on the schema, entity, and event levels. The proposed scheme incorporates an algorithm that merges and ranks sensor streams for schema integration and event identification, and performs contextual record registration and deduplication for entity resolution. We tested the proposed integration scheme on two sets of sensor-based mHealth data related to human activity recognition. Preliminary results show that the proposed integration scheme contributes to enhancements in event identification precision compared to the classification performance of separate datasets produced within the same mHealth system.},

abstract={Adaptive security can take dynamic trade-off decisions autonomously at runtime and is considered a key desirable attribute in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, there is no clear evidence that it can handle these trade-offs optimally to add value to such a complex and dynamic network. We present a scenario-based approach to recognize and evaluate typical security trade-off situations in the IoT. Using the Event-driven Adaptive Security (EDAS) model, we provide the assessment of dynamic trade-off decisions in the IoT. We have showed that an optimum trade-off mitigation response in the IoT can be automated by assessing various contextual requirements, such as the QoS and user preferences, thing capabilities, and the risk faced, at runtime. eHealth scenarios are examined to illustrate system application in IoT-based remote patient monitoring systems.},

abstract={Nowadays, ageing related diseases represent one of the most relevant challenges for developed countries. The use of healthcare remote technology may allow reducing most of the management of the chronic diseases meanwhile it may also contribute to the improvement of elderly people's quality of life. Unfortunately, despite the advent of Internet of things and the even decreasing price of sensors, current proposals are not extensible during runtime meaning that they need to be maintained offline by engineers. Therefore, in this paper we discuss how to build an ad-hoc extensible (during runtime) healthcare monitoring system by using low cost wireless sensors and already existent Internet of things technology as communication platform. Moreover, we present a prototype of a basic healthcare remote monitoring system, which alerts, in real time, patients' relatives or medical doctors that an elderly people is experienced a problem that could need medical attention or hospitalization.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoTs) is gaining increasing significance due to real-time communication and decision making capabilties of sensors integrated into everyday objects. IoTs are power and bandwidth-constrained with applications in smarthome, healthcare, transportation and industrial domains. Routing bears significant importance in IoTs where sensors acting as hosts deliver data to the gateways which in turn impacts power consumption. Thus there exists a need for modeling and analysis of routing in IoT networks towards predicting power consumption. In this work, we develop an analytical model of a naive flooding based routing protocol using Markov chains. In particular, we derive steady state transition probabilities of transmit and receive states using protocol execution traces and further utilize them towards predicting power consumption. Our approach to modeling is generic in that it can be applied to routing protocols across domains. Evaluation of the model shows that the predicted values for power consumption lie closer to the actual observations obtained using ns-2 simulation thus resulting in minimal mean square errors.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is set to be one of the most disruptive technology paradigms since the advent of the Internet itself. Market research company Gartner estimates that around 4.9 billion connected things will be in use in 2015, and around 25 billion by 2020. While there are substantial opportunities accompanying IoT, spanning from Healthcare to Energy, there are an equal number of concerns regarding the security and privacy of this plethora of ubiquitous devices. In this position paper we approach security and privacy in IoT from a different perspective to existing research, by considering the impact that IoT may have on the growing problem of insider threat within enterprises. Our specific aim is to explore the extent to which IoT may exacerbate the insider-threat challenge for organisations and overview the range of new and adapted attack vectors. Here, we focus especially on (personal) devices which insiders bring and use within their employer's enterprise. As a start to addressing these issues, we outline a broad research agenda to encourage further research in this area.},

abstract={Humankind has been collecting data since the recording started, but in the last decade with the considerable advances in computing and storage technologies, advancements of cloud computing, development of ubiquitous connectivity and the internet of things, there has been explosion in the size and variety of collected data. Nevertheless, one can be data-rich and knowledge-poor, and this is where the data analytics and the development and application of machine learning models become necessity for gaining insight of complex processes to prove scientific theories and discoveries, support decision making and enhance strategic planning in different areas of the economy, finance, industry, healthcare, etc. Recently, there is an influx of polymorphic, unstructured and multimodal data - social media, images, audio, video, etc., which is complicating further the data processing and knowledge extraction process. But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected- pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that. Then will briefly talk about supervised and unsupervised learning and the use of three supervised approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Random Forests (RF); and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving radar signal classification and source identification problem. Results from applying the NN, RF and SVM (using R and Matlab) on complete data subset (without missing data) and the full dataset with substituted (up to 60%) missing data with MI, KNN-I and BTl will be critically analysed and discussed. Finally, I'll talk about the opportunities and challenges in applying computational intelligence and machine learning techniques to Big Data and the available software for Big Data.},

With its wide ranging applications in Healthcare, Home automation, Industrial Control and environmental and social domains, IoTs can have wide ranging expectations. Major roadblocks to the deployment and prevalent use of IoTs are power and privacy-security vulnerabilities. IoTs have conflicting requirements and choosing appropriate tradeoffs based on the situation will lead to its increased use. Though varying projections have large investment in IoTs, there is also increased skepticism due to privacy and security concerns.

In the modern health care environment, the usage of IoT technologies brings convenience of physicians and patients, since they are applied to various medical areas (such as real-time monitoring, patient information management, and healthcare management). The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT developments in healthcare system, where a patient can be monitored using a collection of tiny-powered and lightweight wireless sensor nodes. However, the development of this new technology in healthcare applications without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. In this paper, at first, we highlight the major security requirements in BSN-based modern healthcare system. Subsequently, we propose a secure IoT-based healthcare system using BSN, called BSN-Care, which can efficiently accomplish those requirements.},

abstract={It is estimated that by 2020 that the Internet of Things with embedded and wearable computing will have a major impact on society and be providing beneficial services in a wide variety of applications. It has already accomplished some cost savings in operations and increases in asset efficiency. Increased connectivity and improved safety, security, and reliability are expected to increase potential value in a range of applications from healthcare to transportation. As much of the technology is embedded and invisible it can have the role of a smart assistant working away autonomously and unobtrusively in the background. However, automatic monitoring of activities brings increased potential invasion of personal spaces and personal data. There are significant issues in a number of areas which still have to be addressed in order to ensure safe, reliable and trustworthy systems. A prototype funded by the UK Technology Strategy Board demonstrates the value and advantages of business to business collaboration via the Internet.

abstract={Cloud computing paradigm is becoming very popular these days. However, it does not include wireless sensors and mobile phones which are needed to enable new emerging applications such as remote home medical monitoring. Therefore, a combined Cloud-Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provides scalable on-demand data storage and resilient computation power at the cloud side as well as anytime, anywhere health data monitoring at the IoT side. As both the privacy of personal medical data and flexible data access should be provided, the data in the Cloud are always encrypted and access control must be operated upon encrypted data together with being fine-grained to support diverse accessibility. Since a plain combination of encryption before access control is not robust and flexible, we propose a scheme with tailored design. The scheme makes use of cipher-policy attributes based encryption to empower robustness and flexibility. The scheme describes a general framework to solve the secure requirements, and leaves the flexibility of concrete constructions intentionally.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important topic in both industry and academia for the recent years as it offers great potentials in numerous real world applications. This paper considers the problem of fault diagnosis and prediction from IoT data collected in the process industry. We propose a solution by making use of IoT enabling technologies offered by SAP. The proposed solution first discovers the causal relationship of the physical devices by analyzing only the device sensor data without the knowledge of the physical manufacturing system. While faults of certain devices can be detected by monitoring the healthy index of these devices in real-time, possible faults of other devices can be predicted based on the causal relationship discovered in the previous step. Such prediction capability enables new breeds of predictive maintenance applications where appropriate actions can be recommended to operators of the manufacturing system in a timely manner. The viability of the proposed solution is confirmed by a real world application of IoT conducted with an industry partner.},

year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={149-153},
abstract={Many application scenarios for IoT (Internet of Things) require the interconnection of high speed sensing nodes with data rates of Gbps. As an example surveillance or smart mobility applications adopt multiple photo and video cameras working at different spectral range (visible, near infrared, far infrared) and covering different fields of view, or they exploit arrays of radio/light detection and ranging (Radar/Lidar) sensors to detect the presence of targets, of their speeds, distance and direction. Even the access of distributed nodes in IoT towards a centralized cloud storage/processing center requires high data rate connections. Since low size and low weight of the nodes are needed, IoT can benefit from the high communication data rate, several Gbps, that can be provided by fully integrated mm-wave wireless transceivers. The wavelength at such frequency is few mm and hence the whole transceiver including the antenna can be integrated in a single chip. To this aim, this paper presents the design of 60 GHz transceiver key blocks (Low Noise Amplifier, Power Amplifier, Antenna) to ensure connection distances up to 10 m and data rate of several Gbps. Around 60 GHz worldwide there are freely-available (unlicensed) several GHz of bandwidth. By using a CMOS SOI technology RF, analog and digital baseband circuitry can be integrated in the same chip minimizing noise coupling. Even the antenna is integrated on chip reducing cost and size vs. classic off-chip antenna solutions. The proposed transceiver allows for the implementation of low cost nodes for IoT systems with data rates of several Gbps and with a 10 m link distance. These specifications are suitable for home/office scenarios, or for body area networks (healthcare, wellness) or for applications on board vehicles (cars, trains, ships, airplanes).},

abstract={The importance and reach of sensors networks grows every year, however, there are still many challenges that must be addressed. One of them, is the standardized interchange of information that enable interoperability between different networks and applications. To answer this challenge, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has created the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) specification. SWE has given place to different mature implementations for the enterprise sector; however, they are usually over dimensioned alternatives that require robust systems. This differs from the capacity of small sensors networks like those used in domotics or eHealth, which are part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This work proposes a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) implementation, which is one of the fundamental components of the SWE specification, that fits small sensors networks environments and that does not require very robust systems to operate, thus providing a standard and agile platform. This implementation of the Sensor Observation Service provides independence from manufacturers and heterogeneous sensors networks, increasing interoperability because information is transmitted in a standard structure and through well-defined software interfaces. It also allows installation in devices of small capacity and low power consumption, reducing deployment costs and encouraging massive deployment of sensors networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).},

On the other hand, the technological evolution of IoT facing serious challenges. The fragmentation in terms of communication protocols and data formats at device level is one of these challenges. Vendor specific application architectures, proprietary communication protocols and lack of IoT standards are some reasons behind the IoT fragmentation. In this paper we propose a software enabled framework to address the fragmentation challenge. The framework is based on flexible communication agents that are deployed on a gateway and can be adapted to various devices communicating different data formats using different communication protocol. The communication agent is automatically generated based on specifications and automatically deployed on the Gateway in order to connect the devices to a central platform where data are consolidated and exposed via REST APIs to third party services. Security and scalability aspects are also addressed in this work.},

abstract={Some applications introduced in each 5G mobile communication project (5G-P) assume special use cases such as when many people simultaneously use their mobile phone in a restricted area like a stadium or when using traffic safety systems are in common. And, some of them such as mobile healthcare and the Internet of things (IOT) have already been presented by many people. However, the reasons those applications will be widely used are uncertain. And then, most authors of articles related to future mobile communication made no mention of business schemes such as who deploys network infrastructure or who provides service content. However, the histories of existing mobile communication markets may show applications that are different from the ones written in the above articles and new business schemes that are different from existing ones. In this article, I analyze the dominant non-voice applications of the existing mobile communication systems including paging services and identify the primary factors that made them dominant. I also analyze the business models of the network carriers. This analysis leads me to forecast that the next-generation of dominant mobile communication applications will be developed on the basis of a balance between the freedom of participants and suspicion, and the business models will become more liberal. Moreover, I forecast that a service that comes after SNS messaging services will be the one in which experiences are shared.},

Pervasive or ubiquitous computing enhanced this to a level that any two intelligent physical objects can communicate with each other, anytime and anywhere. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm emerging from ubiquitous computing that facilitates communication between many real world objects by collaboration of various technologies. Integrating IoT with Cloud Computing derives manifold advantages to store and process enormous data generated by heterogeneous devices. Though both the technologies together have profound effect in many application areas like smart home, smart agriculture, healthcare etc., their integration involves many challenges. Security is one of the most important issues confronted by IoT-Cloud architecture. In this paper, we propose a Secure, Hybrid, Cloud Enabled architecture for IoT (SHCEI), which uses hybrid cloud (both public and private cloud). This architecture ensures security of intradomain data and will also address issues of scalability and interoperability.

abstract={Football, also called soccer, is one of the most popular sports in the world, if one considers the number of fans as well as the number of players. However, footballers face serious injuries during the match and even during training. Concussion, hypoglycemia, swallowing the tongue and shortness of breath are examples of the health problems footballers face, and in extreme cases, may lead to death. In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health. This paper proposes an IoT-based architecture for the sport of football, called IoT Football. Our proposal aims to embed sensing devices (e.g. sensors and RFID), telecommunication technologies (e.g. ZigBee) and cloud computing in the sport of football in order monitor the health of footballers and reduce the occurrence of adverse health conditions.

To preserve user security and privacy in AAL systems, it is significant to ensure secure communication link establishment among the medical devices and the remote hosts or servers that are interested in accessing the critical health data. However, due to the limited resources available in such constrained devices, it is challenging to exploit expensive cryptographic operations in the conventional security protocols.

Furthermore, the virtualization revolution that has enabled the Cloud computing success will benefit the Telecom domain, which in turn will be able to support the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). The main objective of MEC solution is the export of some Cloud capabilities to the user's proximity decreasing the latency, augmenting the available bandwidth and decreasing the load on the core network. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of the future, has benefited from the proliferation in the mobile phones' usage. Many mobile applications have been developed to connect a world of things (wearables, home automation systems, sensors, RFID tags etc.) to the Internet. Even if it is not a complete solution for a scalable IoT architecture but the time sensitive IoT applications (e-healthcare, real time monitoring, etc.) will profit from the MEC architecture. Furthermore, IoT can extend this paradigm to other areas (e.g. Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks) with the use of Software Defined Network (SDN) orchestration to cope with the challenges hindering the IoT real deployment, as we will illustrate in this paper.},

abstract={Emerging Mobile Phone Sensing (M-Sense) systems enable a flexible large scale wireless sensing capability and also reduce the need of establishing the infrastructure of Wireless Sensor Network for collecting sensory information in the Internet of Things applications. M-Sense has been applied in numerous scenarios including mobile-health systems, environmental monitoring, vehicle ad hoc network, mobile social network, and so on. The drawback of existing M-Sense systems in terms of privacy, trust, less efficiency of participating in multiple sensing networks, has motivated the next generation sensing service provisioning approach. This paper introduces a generic service-oriented Mobile Host Sensing as a Service provisioning framework that allows a mobile device to provide sensing data to multiple parties based on mobile Web services. The proposed framework consists of the hybrid workflow-based control system, the dynamic Utility Cloud service, and the service provisioning scheduling model to enhance the quality of service provisioning. The prototype has been tested on real mobile devices and the details of the performance evaluation are presented.},

abstract={Information and communication technologies have augmented interoperability and rapidly advanced varying industries, with vast complex interconnected networks being formed in areas such as safety-critical systems, which can be further categorised as critical infrastructures. What also must be considered is the paradigm of the Internet of Things which is rapidly gaining prevalence within the field of wireless communications, being incorporated into areas such as e-health and automation for industrial manufacturing. As critical infrastructures and the Internet of Things begin to integrate into much wider networks, their reliance upon communication assets by third parties to ensure collaboration and control of their systems will significantly increase, along with system complexity and the requirement for improved security metrics. We present a critical analysis of the risk assessment methods developed for generating attack graphs. The failings of these existing schemas include the inability to accurately identify the relationships and interdependencies between the risks and the reduction of attack graph size and generation complexity. Many existing methods also fail due to the heavy reliance upon the input, identification of vulnerabilities, and analysis of results by human intervention. Conveying our work, we outline our approach to modelling interdependencies within large heterogeneous collaborative infrastructures, proposing a distributed schema which utilises network modelling and attack graph generation methods, to provide a means for vulnerabilities, exploits and conditions to be represented within a unified model.},

abstract={With WSN technologies becoming more reliable, sophisticated and more capable of meeting the demands of market opportunities and with its broad applications and new emerging trends like: internet of things and integrated web-based services, there still a need for developing protocols to manage and improve coherence and consolidation of the network. Video sensing can be involved in most of the WSN applications like: military, environmental, healthcare, industries and surveillance of all its types, where WMSN came as an important trend of WSN. In this paper an available zigbee-based WSN system model was used, a video source was integrated into it representing a video sensing unit. A network topology of video source node, scalar source node, sink node and a coordinator is presented. The work aims to centralizing control and network management functions at the coordinator removing some loads from other nodes utilizing more resources for data transmission and reception.

abstract={The internet of things (IoT) has been a prevalent research topic in recent years in both academia and industry. The main idea of this framework is the integration of physical objects into a global information network. The vision of the IoT is to integrate and connect anything at any time and any place. For this reason, it is being applied in various areas such as power system monitoring, environment monitoring, network control system, smart health care, military, smart cities management and industry revolution. To achieve the goals, the fifth generation (5G) technology will be the potential infrastructure that will assist the visions of the IoT. This paper proposes a distributed approach for microgrid state estimation. First of all, the modelling of a microgrid is presented. The microgrid state-space model is linearized around the operating point, so that the proposed distributed state estimation using the IoT with 5G networks can be applied. Moreover, we peropose a wireless sensor network based communication network to sense, transmit and estimate the microgrid states. Furthermore, this technical note proposes a novel distributed state estimation method. At the end, the simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully estimate the DER states using the IoT with 5G networks.},

abstract={Smart health care, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart homes, smart water networks and smart electric grids may form the main parts of future smart cities. Standard communication protocols facilitate interconnectivity between software components and assure interoperability between different stakeholders of these components. For electric grids, standards introduce an open Smart Grid for liberalized service-oriented electricity markets by smoothing the way for business interactions and trades. Many organizations such as IEC and IEEE are introducing their standard communication protocols for future smart power grids and their associated smart meters. These standards include but not limited to, IEEE 802, IEEE 1815, IEEE 1901, IEC 62056, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, etc. For smart buildings, smart homes and some wireless sensor networks (WSN), ZigBee is widely used. For smart roads, Internet of Things (IoT) is used in some cases including its messaging protocol Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP) together with WSN. In this paper, open source software (OSS) implementation of such standard protocols is discussed, including obstacles and advantages of a such implementation. Moreover, wireless telecommunication infrastructures including Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth are investigated for the right choice of Smart City applications' infrastructure, since the employment of a standard should be compatible with the field of application, timing requirements and data transmission rate.},

abstract={The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) in medical health care is bound to generate the massive volume of heterogeneous data due to the millions of medical sensors attached with various patients' body. Therefore, to process such amount of heterogeneous data in real-time to take emergency actions in critical health situation is a challenging task. Therefore, to address such issues, we proposed Hadoop-based medical emergency management system using IoT technology, which involves a network architecture with the enhanced processing features for collecting data received from millions of medical sensors attached to the human body. The amount of collected data is then forwarded to the Intelligent Building to process and perform necessary actions using various units such as, collection unit, Hadoop Processing Unit (HPU), and Analysis and decision unit. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Sample medical, sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered to evaluate the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system efficiently process WBAN sensory data.},

abstract={Proliferation of internet-of-things (IoT) will lead to scenarios where humans will interact with and control a variety of networked devices including sensors and actuators. Wearable brain-machine interfaces (BMI) can be a key enabler of this interaction for people with disabilities and limited motor skills. At the same time, BMI can improve the experience of healthy individuals significantly. However, state-of-the-art BMI systems have limited applicability as they are prone to errors even with sophisticated machine learning algorithms used for classifying the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We improve the reliability of BMI communication significantly by proposing two techniques at higher abstraction layers. Our first contribution is a command confirmation protocol that protects the brain-machine communication against false interpretations at run time. The second contribution is an off-line optimal event selection algorithm that identifies the most reliable subset of events supported by the target BMI system. The event selection is guided by novel user specific reliability metrics defined for the first time in this paper. Extensive experiments using a commercial BMI system demonstrate that the proposed techniques increase the communication robustness significantly, and reduce the time to complete a complex navigation task by 63% on average.},

Specifically, wearable technology and robotics can enable a user to collect the required human signals in a comfortable way. HealthIoT is the basic infrastructure for realizing health surveillance, and should be flexible to support multiple application demands and facilitate the management of infrastructure. Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device. This article discusses the background, advantages, and design details of the architecture proposed, which is achieved by an open-ended question and a potential solution. It opens a new research direction of HealthIoT and smart homes.},

abstract={The wide-spread use of wearable devices and mobile apps in the Internet of Things (IoT) environments makes effectively capture of life-logging personal health data come true. A long-term collection of these health data will benefit to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration. But most wearable devices and mobile apps in the market focus on personal fitness plan and lack of compatibility and extensibility to each other. Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation. Also, the demand on high security increases difficulties of designing reliable platform for integrating and managing multi-resource life-logging health data. This paper investigates the possibility of collecting and aggregating life-logging data with the use of wearable devices, mobile apps and social media. It compares existing personal health data collection solutions and identifies essential needs of designing a life-logging data aggregator in the IoT environments. An integrated data collection solution with high secure standard is proposed and deployed on a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare platform: MHA [15] by integrating five life-logging resources: Fitbit, Moves, Facbook, Twitter, etc. The preliminary experiment demonstrates that it successfully record, store and reuse the unified and structured personal health information in a long term, including activities, location, exercise, sleep, food, heat rate and mood.},

But the wide use of cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps makes it possible to monitor and access PA into a more open and connective Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Yet, it still lacks of a systemic survey on how to effectively transfer classic PA monitoring and assessment (PAMA) technologies into a heterogeneous device connected IoT environment.

abstract={Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.},

abstract={Physiological sensor analytics is becoming an important tool to monitor health as the availability of sensor-enabled portable, wearable, and implantable devices becomes ubiquitous in the growing Internet of Things (IoT). Physiological multi-sensor studies have been conducted previously to detect stress. In this study, we focus on ECG monitoring that can now be performed with minimally invasive wearable patches and sensors, to develop an efficient and robust mechanism for accurate stress identification. A unique aspect of our research is personalized individual stress analysis including three stress levels: low, medium and high. Using machine learning algorithms from the ECG signals alone, we could achieve 88.24% accuracy in detecting the three classes of stress. We also find that high stress can be successfully detected for a person in comparison to his or her rest period with 100% accuracy.},

abstract={Recent progress in technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables advanced scenarios for mobile healthcare (m-Health). In this paper, we consider the service intelligence in m-Health (so called smart services). On the one hand, such a service utilizes the telemedicine approach when existing healthcare services (located in hospital) are delivered to remote patients (out of hospital). On the other hand, construction and delivery of a smart service benefit from additional intelligence attributes, beyond a fixed set of healthcare services of a given medical information system. For this promising class of m-Health services, we introduce reference scenarios of personalized assistance for a mobile patient with focus on emergency cases. Our development employs the smart spaces paradigm: patients, medical personnel, healthcare services, and other participants operate within a common networked computing environment and interact by sharing information and its semantics. We contribute design solutions to construct services as smart m-Health spaces.},

abstract={On-Board Diagnostics will play a crucial role in the emerging era of the Internet of Things. With billions of devices deployed, traditional manual preventive maintenance approaches will be cost prohibitive. As we make these small autonomous devices intelligent, it is critical that we also give them a very advanced ability to assess and report their own health. Of course, on-board diagnostics are not a new concept. What is new with the Internet of Things is the extreme economic leverage that the on-board diagnostics will have due to the huge number of devices to be developed. If the on-board diagnostics perform poorly, the resulting surge of support costs could be enough to drive the organization deploying the Internet of Things systems out of business. As an organization gets ready to release millions of a certain type of Internet of Things device into the wild, how confident can the organization be that the on-board diagnostics will really perform as expected? As it turns out, we can learn from history. In the 1960s and 1970s the mainframe and telecommunications industries developed powerful statistical methods for answering this exact question for the large mission-critical systems that they were deploying. This paper will review these historical approaches and show how they can be practically applied to a wide variety of diagnostic systems. The paper will show: How to set business performance objectives for the on-board diagnostics · Practical methods of quantifying failure modes · The statistical measurement approach · How to prepare testing programs · How to administer the tests and evaluate the results.},

abstract={Serious games have been in focus of an increasing number of research efforts in the health domain over the last decade. Their maturity led researchers to increase their efforts on approaches and techniques that will facilitate the adoption of these games by older adults in their daily life. As real users' home is the desired destination of serious games, researchers have started taking them out of the lab settings. Towards this and aligned with the technology acceptance model, perceived ease of use is considered as a primary determinant affecting attitude towards ICT use. Therefore, contemporary mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, smart Tvs, etc.) can play essential role as means of delivering serious games. However, full body activity exergames seem to be more demanding in terms of transferring their technology from the well-established desktop applications to mobile and web technologies. Fortunately, web and mobile technology advancements can handle the emerged challenges. This paper presents the background of exergames on mobile devices and the technologies around them and gives insights on the available technologies that can be used to move full body exergames from desktop applications to web browsers. More specifically, this papers exhibits the future of gaming controllers in the Internet of Things domain and how this would accelerate full body exergames through mobile devices.},

abstract={This paper is a follow-up of a previous paper, dedicated to the description of a holistic view of the user experience (UX) model, presenting the refined user experience framework and model within the Experiential Living Labs for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The holistic model of UX was instantiated for six different use case domains appertaining to the Internet of Things (IoT) based services, namely: wellbeing, environment, logistics, energy efficiency, eBusiness and health. These six use cases demonstrate the difficulty to select the appropriate model elements and properties according to the IoT application context as well as to identify proper metrics for measuring UX. However, based on the six use cases experiments, a bottom-up (grounded) UX model applicable to any IoT use case appears to emerge from the empirical results. The experiments conducted within the use cases show the interest of the iterative nature of the Living Lab experiential design process for improving the design until it reaches the highest level of user satisfaction inducing an appropriate technology adoption rate by consumers. Finally, the refined Experiential Design process and UX model are presented with a set of conclusions.},

abstract={The number of internet connected devices by all accounts is set to increase dramatically in coming years as Internet of Things technologies become cheaper and more convenient. Z-Wave devices have found application in building control, smart energy, health care and equipment monitoring. Its closed standard ensures interoperability of devices and this stability has led to its popularity among consumers. As use of these devices becomes more widespread, the need to protect them becomes more important. In this research, the RF-DNA fingerprinting method is examined to protect these devices using their physical layer attributes. In particular, the traditional method of using parametric features such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis is challenged with the use of non-parametric features mean, median, mode and linear regression coefficient estimates. With careful analysis of variables, a 71% reduction in features is achieved while attaining >94% correct classification rate at an 8 dB lower SNR than using traditional parametric features.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the main paradigm through which medical devices will be connected to the Internet, thereby empowering near-realtime health services and transforming a patient's physical space into a smart space. Recent developments in nanotechnology are giving rise to the Internet of Nano-Things, with a new set of finegrained and highly sophisticated healthcare applications that can be run inside the human body. In this paper, we outline a vision of the ubiquitous healthcare ecosystem and its architectural requirements in order to incorporate nanonetworks. We identify some of the envisioned IoNT healthcare applications and the IoNT requirements that are necessary to support the different application categories, as well as the underlying healthcare service opportunities. In order to understand the current status of implementation, we provide a brief analysis of the major efforts targeted at IoNT performance analysis and evaluation. We finally discuss the most pressing challenges that the IoNT paradigm poses for healthcare applications and services.},

Medication intake is one of the cases where adherence may be difficult for the patients, who are willing to undertake the prescribed therapy. Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure for activity monitoring is a strong candidate solution to maintain adherence of forgetful patients. In this study, we propose an IoT framework where medication intake is ensured with real time continuous activity recognition. We present our use case with the focus of application and network layers. We utilize an activity classification scheme, which considers inter-activity detection consistency based on non-predefined feature extraction as the application layer. The network layer includes a gateway structure ensuring end-to-end reliability in the connection between a wireless sensor network (WSN) and Internet. Results obtained in simulation environment suggest that the selected application and network layers introduce a feasible solution for the medication intake use case.},

abstract={A generic sensor network architecture is developed, combining Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) concepts. Distributed sensor nodes consist of a local controller (Raspberry-Pi board), to pre-process and format data collected from several sensors, and an Ethernet and power management circuit, to interface with PoE-enabled Ethernet ports. The system design follows a client-server architecture: by combining PoE with the IoT, the endpoint clients and servers (PoE controller modules) can communicate in local area network using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Clients can send commands to observe sensor data, change data acquisition sampling rate, and post new sensor resources. As data gets observed by clients, it can be further stored in a custom-designed HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) file format, for post-processing, visualization and data management. The convergence of data and power flow control enables a smart power management at the network level - most of the sensor nodes will be powered-up (awoken) only after custom triggering events detected by a main subset of always-on sensing nodes. These PoE controller modules are intended for structural and environment monitoring in one of the tallest wooden tower in the world, to be built in UBC campus. The generic architecture may be further adopted in the future for other types of applications, like environmental monitoring or human health.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a research field whose main objective is to develop health monitoring systems for elderly patients at home, increasing the degree of patient independence during chronic diseases treatment. AAL systems are composed by several technologies: medical sensors and actuators, computer and mobile devices, Wireress Sensors Networks (WSN), computer networks, software infrastructure and applications. A comprehensive software infrastructure for AAL systems should use these technologies in an integrated manner and be able to cover scenarios involving several patient mobility level, patient locations, and levels of physical and cognitive abilities. The integration of AAL with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies expands the scope of these systems with the ability to connect various sensors and actuators, integrating them into a single network that serves the purpose of patient health monitoring. In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive Cloud based IoT softwre infrastructure for Ambient Assisted Living.

abstract={Technology advancements as well as the Internet-of-Things paradigm enable the design of wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems. Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},

abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) is driving an intense research activity targeting novel consumer applications. It has also an industrial counterpart, where thousands of sensors can be connected together into a proprietary network, i.e. into a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Such Industrial WSN may exhibit various shapes for different kind of applications. It can indeed be used for Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) to survey bridges, railways, avionic or automotive structures, rotating machine maintenance prediction, it can also serve security purposes like fire forest detection, border security, etc. In this paper we presents the architecture of a miniaturized and low-frequency piezoelectric-based vibrational-energy harvesting device (PEH) and its advanced manufacturing process flow. This harvesting technique uses direct piezoelectric effect to transform mechanical vibrations into electrical power. Over the past decade, several MEMS architectures have been built and assessed to harvest such low frequency (50-75Hz) vibrations. MEMS based PEH use thin (<;5μm) and thick (<;50μm) piezoelectric films allowing a high degree of integration and miniaturization, but at low frequencies the amount of harvested energy is not enough to power sensing electronics which typically consumes 100μW in average during 200ms. To overcome this limitation, we have developed and optimized a thinning process that enable us to use ultra-thin bulk PZT material (<;20μm) and propose a performant and miniaturized PEH.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Model-driven engineering has gained popularity in recent years offering a way to abstractly specify complex computational models and algorithms and generate both configurations and code to achieve their realisation. Often domain-specific languages are used as way to express these model structures enabling end users to better specify their target system needs. We have been applying MDE and Domain-Specific Visual Languages (DSVLs) to the domain of Big Data analytics systems to better support end users in realising solutions for the enterprise as well as individual needs. In this talk I discuss key requirements of Big Data social enterprise systems, including those for health, transport and finance domains. I discuss approaches to utilising MDE and DSVLs to achieve desired solutions, including interface and architectures. I report on our and others progress to date and outline ways increasing personal and social data from the emerging Internet of Things with further transform this space.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, any physical or virtual object can be identified, addressable, controlled, and monitored via Internet. In the e-health scenario, these smart objects can be body sensors allowing the continuous monitoring of vital signs of patients. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of such devices, it is necessary to enable interoperability among them and to facilitate the development of applications that make use of the provided data. In this context, this paper introduces EcoHealth (Ecosystem of Health Care Devices), a middleware platform that integrates heterogeneous body sensors for enabling the remote monitoring of patients and improving medical diagnosis. In this paper, we present the EcoHealth architecture and a performance evaluation with an e-health application developed as proof of concept.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to deliver connected automation for monitoring, optimization, and control of processes and systems in sectors such as the automotive, healthcare and security. In this way, the IoT promises to make better use of the available resources, enable real-time interaction, and support innovative applications. Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host. Within the proposed ETT, both the mobility model, as well as the detection thresholds are calculated solely based on sensory data, making the whole system both scalable and robust to dynamic changes. Experimental results demonstrate the many-fold improvements in efficiency of the proposed solution compared to traditional periodic tracking. These improvements are also validated in practice through an implementation on an operating bus route service.},

abstract={The pervasiveness of connected embedded devices and Internet of Things (IoT) related application domains like smart cities, e-Health or, transportation lead to an constantly increasing amount of data, compute- and storage resources surrounding us. However, currently there is a gap between data acquisition and processing, usually bridged by gateway based approaches that integrate the devices and forward the data to Clouds in order to be processed. Integration is often static and limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute- and storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart devices, like smart TVs or smart phones. As a solution, we propose the Device Cloud, which can be envisioned as an application of the Cloud Computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) paradigms to the IoT domain. The approach will allow sharing and on demand provisioning of resources provided by the connected embedded devices surrounding us. Besides introducing an architecture draft to provide a common understanding of the overall problem, the main focus of the paper is to discuss challenges that arise and give a state of the art review of related research initiatives that are eligible to contribute to possible solutions.},

We developed the Smart Home Protocol (SHP) to enable connectivity between various our smart home devices including smart appliances, LED bulbs, IP cameras, etc. In this paper, we present an overview of the SHP based on Restful architecture, followed by a detailed description of architecture and application profile for smart home devices. We also introduce our smart home services and describe the implementation of smart home protocol in smart appliances.

abstract={With the increasing availability of medical sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for personal use, it becomes feasible to maintain a repository of measurements for personal health conditions. Consequently, it is tempting to analyze in-progress diseases and to identify the development of potential diseases with the measurement repository. However, there are a number of technical challenges in developing such applications, modeling the relationships between diseases and acquired measurements, representing medical expertise in machine-readable forms, and high complexity in diagnosing disease methods. We adopt a semantic-based approach to resolve the first two challenges, and utilize the concept of cloud computing to tackle with the last challenge. In this paper, we present a cloud platform which provides a core set of functionality needed to enable personal medical diagnosis over the network. We believe that the presented platform provides a comprehensive core functionality needed for various types of personal healthcare IoT applications.},

abstract={In the recent past, wireless power transfer (WPT) has attracted a lot of research interest as enabling technology for wireless sensors networks, within the context of the Internet of Things, and to finally achieve fully autonomous electronic devices. A setup where wirelessly powered electronic devices are deployed on the human body is both very appealing and very challenging. Indeed, autonomous sensors that are unobtrusively integrated into the wearer's jacket may monitor body parameters and the user's environment while remaining invisible to the mobile user as well as to other persons in his/her proximity. Unfortunately, the body-centric environment is one of the hardest configurations to implement such a wireless transfer, given the movement of the wearers and the potential health hazards associated to the exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields.},

abstract={The concurrent popularity of wearable sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) brings significant benefits to body sensor networks (BSN) that could communicate with the cloud computing platforms for bringing interoperability in health and wellness monitoring. We designed Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity. The first set of results is promising and demonstrates the prospect of Pulse-Glasses in the field of cloud-connected BSN.},

abstract={Various industry forecasts project that, by 2020, there will be around 50 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), helping to engineer new solutions to societal-scale problems such as healthcare, energy conservation, transportation, etc. Most of these devices will be wireless due to the expense, inconvenience, or in some cases, the sheer infeasibility of wiring them. Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing - in some cases, even eliminating - their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems).},

abstract={The eHealth trend has spread globally. Internet of Things(IoT) devices for medical service and pervasive Personal Health Information (PHI) systems play important roles in the eHealth environment. A cloud-based PHIsystem appears promising but raises privacy and information security concerns. We propose a cloud-based fine-grained health information access control framework for lightweight IoT devices with data dynamics auditing and attribute revocation functions. Only symmetric cryptographyis required for IoT devices, such as wireless body sensors. A variant of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, dual encryption, and Merkle hash trees are used to support fine-grained access control, efficient dynamic data auditing, batch auditing, and attribute revocation. Moreover, the proposed scheme also defines and handles the cloud reciprocity problem wherein cloud service providers can help each other avoid fines resulting from data loss. Security analysis and performance comparisons show that the proposed scheme is an excellent candidate for a cloud-based PHI system.},

abstract={Internet of Things applications are fast growing recently. One of the things that has a lot of potential is the lighting equipment since it is widely used in our daily life. Recently, the technology of visible light communication (VLC) has been widely discussed. VLC has several advantages, such as freedom of license, line-of-sight security, and less health concern compared with radio-based systems. In addition, the rapid progress of light emitting diode (LED) technology by solid-state lighting allows VLC to be easily deployed and integrated with the existing lighting infrastructure at low costs. However, VLC, when integrated with lighting infrastructure, is usually for one-way communication and is highly sensitive to external interfering light. Thus, transmitting or broadcasting multiple messages simultaneously over a visible light channel without any preprocessing may result in serious collisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle these problems by optical code division multiple access (CDMA) for VLC. With our approach, a VLC receiver can enter an environment without any prior configuration and can be designed with simple hardware. Even a mobile device with a high-resolution photodiode sensor can be used as a receiver. We demonstrate an application of indoor positioning by querying the location service provider on the Internet with the IDs decoded from the received light signals. The prototyping results reveal some communication properties of CDMA-based VLC and its potential for indoor positioning applications.},

ITS provides immediate traffic information for vehicles location tracking, vehicle dispatching, also can be used on taxi management and police cars, fire trucks, ambulance dispatching when serious accidents occur. On quality assurance, ITS involves many kinds of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices and services. Different services and devices have their own Operation Support System (OSS) and it is hard to exchange information. Therefore, our research proposes a framework to integrate end-to-end quality assurance information based on Digital Service Reference Architecture (DSRA) supported by TM Forum. Our framework manages all sub-systems of ITS such as Mobile virtual private network(VPN), fixed-line VPN, ITS car devices, dispatching service platform, etc. It made root cause analysis consuming time less than 10 minutem. and can improve time to market and quality assurance for ICT composite digital service.},

Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS. Indeed, low power consumption is an essential requirement for the swarm of devices especially in the domain of wearable devices for healthcare. Coupled with low cost and reliability, power consumption has to be taken into consideration for any CPS deployment.},

From the viewpoint of application development, ontology sharing is the most important to integrate services. This paper, the first step towards ontology sharing, defines the iKaaS data model as one that integrates data models used in all applications in the project. The data defined in the iKaaS data model is converted into RDF format and stored in the RDF database. The reasoning mechanism in semantic web allows the semantic integration of data and applications.

abstract={Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices permit the massive collection of biosignals (e.g., heart-rate, oxygen level, respiration, blood pressure, photo-plethysmographic signal, etc.) at low cost. These, can be used to help address the individual fitness needs of the users and could be exploited within personalized healthcare plans. In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity. State of the art solutions are also compared with our approach.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) describes an ICT based environment that exposes personalized and context-aware intelligent services, thus creating an appropriate experience to the end user to support independent living and improvement of the everyday quality of life of both healthy elderly and disabled people. The social and economic impact of AAL systems have boosted the research activities that combined with the advantages of enabling technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve the performance and the efficiency of such systems. Sensors and actuators inside buildings can create an intelligent sensing environments that help gather realtime data for the patients, monitor their vital signs and identify abnormal situations that need medical attention. AAL applications might be life critical and therefore have very strict requirements for their performance with respect to the reliability of the devices, the ability of the system to gather data from heterogeneous devices, the timeliness of the data transfer and their trustworthiness. This work presents the functional architecture of SOrBet (Marie Curie IAPP project) that provides a framework for interconnecting efficiently smart devices, equipping them with intelligence that helps automating many of the everyday activities of the inhabitants. SOrBet is a paradigm shift of traditional AAL systems based on a hybrid architecture, including both distributed and centralized functionalities, extensible, self-organising, robust and secure, built on the concept of “reliability by design”, thus being capable of meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of demanding applications such as AAL.},

abstract={Healthcare and tourism are among the fastest growing business domains in the world. These are biggest service industries that affect whole world population and give jobs to millions of people. Recently we witness major changes in both industries, as more services are transferred to small providers, including individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people. This provides a huge space for developing and applying new business models. In this paper we summarize research and development results of IoT studies and discuss ideas on how to apply them to business.},

abstract={Sensor technology and sensor networks have evolved so rapidly that they are now considered a core driver of the Internet of Things (IoT), however data analytics on IoT streams is still in its infancy. This paper introduces an approach to sensor data analytics by using the OpenIoT1 middleware; real time event processing and clustering algorithms have been used for this purpose. The OpenIoT platform has been extended to support stream processing and thus we demonstrate its flexibility in enabling real time on-demand application domain analytics. We use mobile crowd-sensed data, provided in real time from wearable sensors, to analyse and infer air quality conditions. This experimental evaluation has been implemented using the design principles and methods for IoT data interoperability specified by the OpenIoT project. We describe an event and clustering analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on data streams. It can be regarded as a valuable tool to understand complex phenomena, e.g., air pollution dynamics and its impact on human health.},

abstract={Wearables are the next big development in the mobile internet of things. Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide hap tic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.},

abstract={Demand for medical services is increasing rapidly because of worldwide aging and increase in population. Most countries are trying to introduce and disseminate telemedicine service (TMS) to decrease the necessary budget for health services. However, many doctors are concerned about the security of telemedicine services. Security of medical information should be reinforced for widespread use of telemedicine. This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats. This paper considers the security aspects of telemedicine and the Internet of things (IoT) together, because, after all, healthcare-devices perform a function of telecommunication. This paper reviews the necessity and strategy for enhancing security of medical information systems. The risk of data leak in medical information systems is analyzed quantitatively and is used to support the need for reinforcement of security.},

This brings in a lot of concerns related to security, privacy, standardization, power management. This paper aims at enhancing security in smart home systems. Devices like thermostat, air conditioners, doors and lighting systems are connected with each other and the internet through the internet of things technologies. Encryption and hash algorithms are proposed in this paper through which devices in the IoT can securely send messages between them. Encryption algorithm is used to ensure confidentiality as the attackers cannot interpret the cipher text that is sent. In order to ensure integrity (cipher text is not changed) hash algorithm is used.},

abstract={Emerging sensor-embedded smartphones motivated the mobile sensing researches. With the integrated embedded hardware and software sensor components, and mobile network technologies, smartphones are capable of providing various environmental context information via embedded mobile device-hosted Web services (MWS). MWS enhance the capability of various mobile sensing applications such as mobile crowd sensing, real time mobile health monitoring, mobile social network in proximity and so on. Although recent smartphones are quite capable in terms of mobile data transmission speed and computation power, the frequent usage of high performance multi-core mobile CPU and the high speed 3G/4G mobile Internet data transmission will quickly drain the battery power of the mobile device. Numerous previous researches have tried to overcome the resource intensive issues in mobile embedded service provisioning domain. However, most of the efforts were constrained because of the underlying resource intensive technologies. This paper proposes a lightweight mobile Web service provisioning framework for mobile sensing. The framework utilizes the technologies that were designed for constrained Internet of Things environment to achieve the lightweight mobile Web service provisioning. The prototype experimental results show that the proposed framework can provide higher throughput and less resource consumption than the traditional mobile Web service frameworks.},

Traditional key distribution methods hardly provide single data server the promise to build multiple high-level secure real-time service channels simultaneously with high efficiency. In this paper we consider real-time data collecting or monitoring scenarios, which is commonly happened in health-care. In these scenarios, traditional key distribution approaches in public-key setting have difficulties on considering both security and efficiency during interactions. Besides, anonymity also shows importance during key distribution processes to keep personal privacy. In this paper we propose a secure real-time mobile service system and the corresponding security model, and novelly apply an Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (IBKEM) in the proposed system as an instantiation that achieves one-pass anonymous key distribution in batch for mobile clients. The instantiated system shows both high-level security and efficiency in practice.},

abstract={Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems are widely used in numerous Internet-Of-Things (IoT) applications such as environment monitoring, supply chain tracing, healthcare, and vehicle networks. In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.},

abstract={Embedded sensors are increasingly seen in modern mobile and wearable devices to support better user activities and vital signs monitoring. While more wireless sensing devices are becoming available, network connectivity and scalability remain the key obstacles in achieving seamless information flow and service provision as envisaged by the vision of the Internet of Things. In this paper, a mobile 6LoWPAN network architecture is proposed by engaging Android-based mobile devices as edge routers to address the connectivity and scalability issues with the wider IP network for pervasive healthcare applications. The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor network, together with the Android edge router, form a mobile sub-network that allows seamless information exchange with the Internet and improves service availability for each end user. The proposed architecture includes a customised bare-metal 6LoWPAN protocol designed for ultra low power wireless sensor nodes for long term vital signs monitoring and integrated with Android devices for mobile internet access. The proposed network architecture is demonstrated and validated on a pervasive healthcare monitoring application.},

abstract={One of most important applications of sensing devices under the Internet of Things paradigm is air quality monitoring, which is particularly useful in urban and industrial environments where air pollution is an increasing public health problem. As these sensing systems are usually battery-powered and gas sensors are power-hungry, energy-efficient design and power management are required to extend the device's lifetime. In this paper, we present a two-stage concept where a novel low-power carbon nanotube is used as a gas detector for an energy-consuming metal-oxide (MOX) semiconductor gas sensor. We propose a design of a heterogeneous sensor node where we exploit the low-power nanotube gas sensor and the more accurate MOX sensor. This work performs energy consumption simulations for three event-driven scenarios to evaluate the power consumption reduction, as well as the limitations of carbon nanotubes. Our results show the benefits of the proposed approach over the scenarios with adaptive duty-cycling with only MOX gas sensors, proved with 20%-35% node lifetime prolongation. The delay introduced due to the nanotube recovery time can be overcome by radio duty-cycled activity for detecting alarm messages from the neighbour nodes.},

In summary, TLSensing is composed by a number of constrained devices equipped with sensing and wireless communication capabilities, a central system coordinator that controls data acquisition processes through a dedicated monitoring software, and a web server application that collects data coming from the network and makes them available to the user and to external software entities belonging to the health management system. Starting from the description of the technological background that motivated the development of the presented platform, we will carefully describe both hardware and software components integrated in TLSensing, alongside their interaction and the most important features they cover.

abstract={With the fast development of Internet of Things (IoTs) in recent years, many IoT applications, such as structure health monitoring, surveillance camera and etc, require both extensive computation for burst-mode signal processing as well as ultra low power continuous operations. However, most of conventional IoT processors focus on ultra low power consumption and cannot satisfy those demands. This paper proposes a novel energy-efficient heterogenous dual-core processor, which includes both an ultra low power near-threshold CoreL and a fast CoreH to meet those emerging requirements. Furthermore, an optimal framework is proposed to realize energy efficient task mapping and scheduling. The processor is fabricated and its energy consumption in low power mode is as low as 7.7pJ/cycle and outperforms related work. Detailed analysis under several real applications shows that up to 2.62× energy efficiency improvements can be achieved without deadline miss compared with the high-performance-only signle core architecture.},

abstract={Recent advances in information and communication technologies and embedded systems have given rise to a new disruptive technology, the Internet of Things (IoTs). IoT allows people and objects in the physical world as well as data and virtual environments to interact with each other so as to create smart environments, such as smart transport systems, smart cities, smart health, and so on. However, IoT raises some important questions and also introduces new challenges for the security of systems and processes and the privacy of individuals, such as their location and movements and so on. In this paper, at first, we propose a distributed IoT system architecture. Subsequently, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme, which can ensure some of the notable properties, such as sensor anonymity, sensor untraceability, resistance to replay attacks, cloning attacks, and so on. It is argued that the proposed authentication scheme will be useful in many distributed IoT applications (such as radio-frequency identification-based IoT system, Biosensor-based IoT healthcare system, and so on), where the privacy of the sensor movement is greatly desirable.},

abstract={Present day computer ecosystem offers advanced connectivity of numerous devices, systems and services, providing the basis for the Internet of Things paradigm implementation. What most people perceive of its structure often lacks acknowledgement of the smallest parts of it, albeit as of recently the most used ones, namely smartphones and smartwatches. Being recognized as a prominent member of the wearable/ubiquitous computing family, smartwatches have been gaining in popularity proving themselves valuable in various contexts, ranging from providing fitness applications and general health monitoring, to always-on assistive technology for people with special needs. This paper focuses on an alternative approach to using smartwatches, considering them monitoring tools for system and network administrators able to provide fast and readily available information on various network equipment and services. For this purpose a proof-of-concept application suite was built, used to provide the status of important services on a remote Linux-based server, as well as the status of the server system itself. We show how smartwatches can offer different, and some unique, previously considered impractical ways to convey information. Supporting HCI aspects are specifically discussed, with respect to the Pebble smartwatch basic I/O capabilities limited to four hardware buttons and 1.26" monochromatic display.},

abstract={Just like the internet, Internet of things (IoT) with right standards and technologies, will impact multiple aspects of human lives including Smart Home, Smart Car and Healthcare. Healthcare of things (HoT) would enhance healthcare using the insight provided by sensor data. Healthcare users will subscribe to HoT services that use sensors to get activity data (such as steps walked, hours slept and so on) along with other health vitals (such as heart rate, temperature and weight) to improve user's health. Similarly Smart home users subscribe to a Smart home cloud service that will use data from home sensors. Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers. In this demonstration, we highlight how user experience perspectives impact the data framework design in MPMC environments, using our drops data framework infrastructure. We hope to have these concepts included IoT standardization efforts. This demonstration was also made at CES at the IEEE booth.},

abstract={With the buzz of Internet of Things (IoT), the low power sensor are getting deployed on large scale in applications such as industrial monitoring, smart homes and e-health. For the reason that the sensor devices are battery operated, though the round-robin based Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheduling is the best choice for its high energy and throughput efficiency, the performance degrades as the network scales because of longer frame duration. We address this problem by modelling the network as a tree with interfering links corresponding to the number of devices. We propose a network partitioning approach to reduce these interfering links by extending the tree to a second level. The first level interfering links correspond to optimizing the frame duration where as the second level interfering links correspond to improving the slot utilization. We show that forming this two-level tree is an NP-complete problem by formulating it as a conflict graph. We then propose two polynomial-time algorithms to address offline and online slot allocation requests that resolve these conflicts efficiently by introducing the so called virtual interference links. We illustrate the performance benefits of our proposed algorithms over the conventional round-robin scheduling in terms of improved throughput, scalability and delay.},

abstract={Honey bees have held a critical role in agriculture and nutrition from the dawn of human civilisation. The most crucial role of the bee is pollination; the value of pollination dependant crops is estimated at € 155 billion per year with honey bees identified as the most important pollinator insect. It is clear that honey bees are a vitally important part of the environment which cannot be allowed to fall into decline. The project outlined in this paper uses Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology to monitor a beehive colony and collect key information about activity/environment within a beehive as well as its surrounding area. This project uses low power WSN technologies, including novel sensing techniques, energy neutral operation, and multi-radio communications; together with cloud computing to monitor the behaviour within a beehive. The insights gained through this activity could reduce long term costs and improve the yield of beekeeping, as well as providing new scientific evidence for a range of honey bee health issues. WSN is an emerging modern technology, key to the novel concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). Comprised of embedded sensing, computing and wireless communication devices, they have found applications in nearly every aspect of daily life. Informed by biologists' hypotheses, this work used existing, commercially available WSN platforms together with custom built systems in an innovative application to monitor honey bee health and activity in order to better understand how to remotly monitor the health and behaviour of the bees. Heterogeneous sensors were deployed, monitoring the honey bees in the hive (temperature, CO2, pollutants etc.). Weather conditions throughout the deployment were recorded and a relationship between the hive conditions and external conditions was observed. A full solution is presented including a smart hive, communication, and data aggregation and visualisation tools. Future work will focus on improving the ener- y performance of the system, introducing a more specialised set of sensors, implementing a machine learning algorithm to extract meaning from the data without human supervision; and securing additional deployments of the system.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Prognostics, or predictive diagnostics, offers substantial promise to reduce the life-cycle costs of critical systems. When linked with comprehensive Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) or Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) architectures, prognostics offers significant benefits. Applications range from aerospace to industrial machines on the factory floor. These systems include electronic and mechanical components that are subject to wear-out and eventual failure. Standard test and diagnostics can serve to confirm the quality of the manufactured device or system at time zero but also can be used to monitor the health of the part throughout its lifetime. This is done by linking diagnostics with parameter extraction to determine on-going state-of-health (SoH). Algorithms can analyze the SoH to determine the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as well. Key benefits are that prognostics enable impending failures to be found before they occur, with improvements to safety and serviceability, along with life cycle cost reduction. On-line tests or periodic tests during the components'/systems' lifetime or burn-in tests and diagnosis serve to provide useful input data for the prognostic process. The historical basis for prognostics began with vibration monitoring of mechanical systems. It was found that unique signatures could be detected, extracted, and then correlated with wear on bearings or gears. These unique signatures, in turn, could be used to build fault dictionaries, to alert service personnel and trigger a host of autonomic logistical actions. In recent years, PHM has expanded to the electronics world, where users have raised concern about the robustness of systems when the key components such as ICs may have reduced lifetimes. While conventional mean-time-between-failures (MTBF)-type reliability estimates offer some initial measure of statistical lifetime, the individual system's lifetime is affected by its actual use environment, possible “Black- Swan” events, or damage while in service. The basic process of prognostics involves an orderly sequence of steps ; - Sensing and observability : - Anomaly Detection : - Cross reference against a fault dictionary : - Algorithmic processing of data : - State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) calculations. As with any process or method, the business case has to be examined involving Return on Investment (ROI). Often the ROI calculations transcend organizational boundaries. Some of the early findings have been very encouraging on life-cycle cost reductions. The advent of advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has also introduced promising avenues for further growth in this area. Additional future trends involve the development of key standards for interoperability and tool development. The current state of prognostics, PHM/IVHM, Condition-based Maintenance and new areas of R&D will be discussed, and their future impact on society.},

abstract={Two of the most important drivers of current telecommunication markets are the development of Rich Communication Services (RCS) and cloud computing. The challenges of delivering these new services on a cloud-based architecture are not only on the technical side, they also concern the definition of feasible business models for all the involved agents and the definition and negotiation of proper service level agreements at different levels. This work proposes to provide telecommunication operators with cloud-based infrastructures capable of offering customers innovative and reliable rich communication services based on their phone numbers that cannot be replicated by the Internet competitors in terms of flexibility, scalability or security. This Obliquity as a Service model (MaaS) allows telecommunication providers to maintain relevance for their clients offering not only the common communication services (instant messaging, group communication and chat, file sharing or enriched calls services) but also a new kind of mobiquiotus services related to mobile marketing, smart places, Internet of Things or health care, exploiting all the competitive advantages associated to the development of a vertical cloud in a dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem. In addition, the infrastructure layer needed to support the new proposed model is defined and a first prototype is deployed and evaluated with two real use cases.},

abstract={A novel Internet of Things based architecture supporting scalability and fault tolerance for healthcare is presented in this paper. The wireless system is constructed on top of 6LoWPAN energy efficient communication infrastructure to maximize the operation time. Fault tolerance is achieved via backup routing between nodes and advanced service mechanisms to maintain connectivity in case of failing connections between system nodes. The presented fault tolerance approach covers many fault situations such as malfunction of sink node hardware and traffic bottleneck at a node due to a high receiving data rate. A method for extending the number of medical sensing nodes at a single gateway is presented. A complete system architecture providing a quantity of features from bio-signal acquisition such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Electromyography (EMG) to the representation of graphical waveforms of these gathered bio-signals for remote real-time monitoring is proposed.},

abstract={Effective and efficient behavioral interventions are important and of high interest today. Due to shortcomings of related approaches, we introduce MobileCoach (mobile-coach.eu) as novel open source behavioral intervention platform. With its modular architecture, its rule-based engine that monitors behavioral states and triggers state transitions, we assume MobileCoach to lay a fruitful ground for evidence-based, scalable and low-cost behavioral interventions in various application domains. The code basis is made open source and thus, MobileCoach can be used and revised not only by interdisciplinary research teams but also by public bodies or business organizations without any legal constraints. Technical details of the platform are presented as well as preliminary empirical findings regarding the acceptance of one particular intervention in the public health context. Future work will integrate Internet of Things services that sense and process data streams in a way that MobileCoach interventions can be further tailored to the needs and characteristics of individual participants.},

abstract={Identification system[s], especially Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) system[s] played an important role in the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), and thus its popularity has increased in many industries at an unprecedented rate. GS1 EPCglobal has led the development of RFID standards from unique identifier, communication protocol to event repository. Recently, its scope starts to broaden with the new standard of EPC Information Service (EPCIS v1.1), while GS1 EPCglobal had focused on RFID middleware in the field of supply chain management (SCM). We believe that EPCIS can act as an event-based context repository for IoT. However, the challenges of scalability and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from a variety of sources. In this paper, we propose the novel open source platform complying with the EPCIS v1.1 specification called Oliot EPCIS, which can collect and share event data for a broad range of IoT applications. The main contribution of the paper is as follows. To resolve the challenges, we propose the scalable and flexible EPCIS architecture, the document-based model of EPCIS event and the new event called SensorEvent. We show that Oliot EPCIS generally outperforms two existing solutions through the comparative experiment. Also, with the healthcare case study, we show that Oliot EPCIS can capture and share sensor values requiring a very intensive data rate based on SensorEvent.},

abstract={This paper presents an important step forward towards increasing the independence of people with severe motor disabilities, by using brain-computer interfaces to harness the power of the Internet of Things. We analyze the stability of brain signals as end-users with motor disabilities progress from performing simple standard on-screen training tasks to interacting with real devices in the real world. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the concept of shared control-which interprets the user's commands in context-empowers users to perform rather complex tasks without a high workload. We present the results of nine end-users with motor disabilities who were able to complete navigation tasks with a telepresence robot successfully in a remote environment (in some cases in a different country) that they had never previously visited. Moreover, these end-users achieved similar levels of performance to a control group of 10 healthy users who were already familiar with the environment.},

abstract={The emergence of Internet of Things and the availability of inexpensive sensor devices and platforms capable of wireless communications enable a wide range of applications such as intelligent home and building automation, mobile healthcare, smart logistics, distributed monitoring, smart grids, energy management, asset tracking to name a few. These devices are expected to employ Constrained Application Protocol for the integration of such applications with the Internet, which includes User Datagram Protocol binding with Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol to provide end-to-end security. This paper presents a framework called BlinkToSCoAP, obtained through the integration of three software libraries implementing lightweight versions of DTLS, CoAP and 6LoWPAN protocols over TinyOS. Furthermore, a detailed experimental campaign is presented that evaluates the performance of DTLS security blocks. The experiments analyze BlinkToSCoAP messages exchanged between two Zolertia Z1 devices, allowing evaluations in terms of memory footprint, energy consumption, latency and packet overhead. The results obtained indicate that securing CoAP with DTLS in Internet of Things is certainly feasible without incurring much overhead.},

abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have recently been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit. The results and discussion show the validity and performance of our system.},

There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN construction scheme that is consists of 4 operations, the clustered topology setup, mobility support, and transmission efficiency enhancement. As an auxiliary benefit, the proposed scheme achieves an energy efficient feature by reducing the number of total control messages.

Too often innovation is focus on the technical evolution and underestimated on the business field, however it is a key aspect for new technologies and services to reach commercial success. Traditional business models in the energy sector will suffer big changes in the next years, as the Smart Grid concept is developed. By the advent of new services and applications, horizontal and vertical partnerships with competitors and other actors will take place.

The platform has been designed in order to overcome the limitations of well-known technologies for mobile architectures, such as the battery lifetime and the lack of the open source codes. To reduce these issues the platform integrates the fast, easy-to-use, safe and low-power Near Field Communication protocol for data transmission in proximity, addressing the Internet of Things paradigm. The platform uses the Arduino NANO board and the related open source software libraries, so it could be possible to add new functionalities in a fast way. The first prototype of the platform has been customized for human body temperature measurement by using the digital TMP100 temperature sensor. However, a real “ecosystem” of portable devices could be prototyped with low-effort for the acquisition/transmission of other kind of clinical signs such as heart-rate, breath-rate, ECG.},

Among the various energy harvesting techniques, vibrational piezoelectric energy harvesters have several advantages compare to other solutions (e.g. high output density power, high output voltage). One of the main constraints in the exploitation of such a technology is the limited bandwidth of the devices, intrinsic to the mechanical resonator typically used.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important research topic in the last decade, where things refer to interconnected machines and objects with embedded computing capabilities employed to extend the Internet to many application domains. While research and development continue for general IoT devices, there are many application domains where very tiny, concealable, and non-intrusive Things are needed. The properties of recently studied nanomaterials, such as graphene, have inspired the concept of Internet of NanoThings (IoNT), based on the interconnection of nanoscale devices. Despite being an enabler for many applications, the artificial nature of IoNT devices can be detrimental where the deployment of NanoThings could result in unwanted effects on health or pollution. The novel paradigm of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is introduced in this paper by stemming from synthetic biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of biological embedded computing devices. Based on biological cells, and their functionalities in the biochemical domain, Bio-NanoThings promise to enable applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation networks, and environmental control of toxic agents and pollution. The IoBNT stands as a paradigm-shifting concept for communication and network engineering, where novel challenges are faced to develop efficient and safe techniques for the exchange of information, interaction, and networking within the biochemical domain, while enabling an interface to the electrical domain of the Internet.},

pages={45-52},
abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},

abstract={The focus on this paper is to build an Android platform based mobile application for the healthcare domain, which uses the idea of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. We have built an application called 'ECG Android App' which provides the end user with visualization of their Electro Cardiogram (ECG) waves and data logging functionality in the background. The logged data can be uploaded to the user's private centralized cloud or a specific medical cloud, which keeps a record of all the monitored data and can be retrieved for analysis by the medical personnel. Though the idea of building a medical application using IoT and cloud techniques is not totally new, there is a lack of empirical studies in building such a system. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of IoT. Further, the paper presents an infrastructure for the healthcare domain, which consists of various technologies: IOIO microcontroller, signal processing, communication protocols, secure and efficient mechanisms for large file transfer, data base management system, and the centralized cloud. The paper emphasizes on the system and software architecture and design which is essential to overall IoT and cloud based medical applications. The infrastructure presented in the paper can also be applied to other healthcare domains. It concludes with recommendations and extensibilities found for the solution in the healthcare domain.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a major paradigm shift from traditional Internet applications that connects things / objects to the Internet for automatic sensing, information processing, understanding, reasoning, decision and response to virtual and physical world. Due to its highly distributed and heterogeneous characteristics, it requires more semantic interactions between different scenarios. Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions. We have preliminarily implemented the OntoIoT framework and domain extension in selected scenarios of smart space and healthcare. A data-driven and other ontology evaluation approaches are used to prove the scalability and interoperability of OntoIoT. Result demonstrates that, compared to other test ontologies, Onto IoT is more suitable for the given application scenario.},

abstract={Recent advancements in integrated radio design have enabled many new applications ranging from wearable health-care or fitness monitors to Internet of Things devices, structural integrity monitors, and beyond. In many of these applications, device size and battery life are of critical importance. Since radios often consume a significant portion of the power budget in small sensing nodes [1], reducing radio power consumption is an effective way to decrease battery size or increase battery life. Reducing radio power consumption can be challenging as there are important tradeoffs between power consumption and performance metrics such as radiated output power, linearity, sensitivity, channelization capabilities, and interference sensitivity. Low-power radio designs often sacrifice one or more of these metrics in the pursuit of low overall power consumption.},

abstract={As the population is increasing worldwide, huge need arises to provide proper health-care services. With the advent of modern technologies the need-gap may be augmented. Sensor is one such technology which can be used to enable Internet of Things based health-care monitoring system. In this paper, implementation of such a system is described. In a real time health monitoring system, there are many sensors connected to a local data processing unit through a shared channel having a fixed bandwidth. These sensors have a wide variety of channel access requirements. The access to the channel should be discrete, so that each and every sensor avails the required bandwidth and delay in the shared channel. In this paper, a scheduling technique is proposed for the IoT based system, which nullify interference among different sensors and consequent distortation of precious health data. Implementation of this technique in our prototype health-care monitoring application is discussed in this paper.},

abstract={The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), the IEEE 802.15.4 standard introduces wireless sensor network (WSN) from personal area network (PAN) into low power personal area network (LoWPAN). Hence, the use of Internet Protocol (IP) into LoWPAN has broadened new research area known as 6LoWPAN. Nowadays, 6LoWPAN technology is swiftly gaining recognition for its extensive application, ranging from healthcare to environmental monitoring. One of the challenges in 6LoWPAN is the route break often occurs due to node mobility, node failure and channel impairments. There are types of routing protocol that have been proposed to reroute or provide alternative routing to overcome the route break problem. However, the network is burdened of load RREQ the whole network. In this paper, we proposed LABC mechanism in the Local Route Repair using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm in 6LoWPAN network to enhance the routing against route breakage. We compare the packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay with scalable number of traffic and show that our routing protocol with LABC mechanism significantly reduce average end-to-end delay and increase number of packets delivery.},

abstract={The number of Non-communicable disease (NCD) patients in China is growing rapidly, which is far beyond the capacity of the national health and social security system. Community health stations do not have enough doctors to take care of their patients in traditional ways. In order to establish a bridge between doctors and patients, we propose eBPlatform, which is an information system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for homecare of the NCD patients. The eBox is a sensor which can be deployed in the patient's home for blood pressure measurement, blood sugar measurement and ECG signals collection. Some services are running on the remote server, which can receive the samples, filter and analyze the ECG signals. The uploaded data will be pushed to a web portal, with which doctors provide treatments online. The system requirements, design and implementation of hardware and software are discussed respectively. Finally, we investigate a case study with 50 NCD patients for half a year in Beijing. The results show that eBPlatform can increase the efficiency of the doctor and make a big progress to eliminate the numerical imbalance between community medical practitioners and NCD patients.},

Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks.

A secure and able connection will be required to connect either a cloud based or an in-house server to the embedded sensors. The ability to ensure that the data generated by the sensor networks is securely streamed to the central server will allow for real time access to the data.

title={Influencing data availability in IoT enabled cloud based e-health in a 30 day readmission context},
year={2014},

pages={475-480},
abstract={The US healthcare Affordable Care Act established the 30 day readmission protection program as one of the base lines of measuring quality of care at hospitals and post discharge. With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.},

abstract={Physical objects with embedded sensors are increasingly being networked together using wireless and internet technologies to form Internet of Things (IoT). However, early applications that rely on IoT data fail to provide comprehensive situational awareness. This often requires combining physical (i.e., IoT) data with social data created by humans on the Web and increasingly on their mobile phones (i.e., citizen sensing) as well as other data such as structured open data and background knowledge available on the Web (i.e., cyber data and knowledge). In this paper, we explore how integration and analysis of multimodal physical-cybersocial data can support advanced applications and enrich human experience. Specifically, we illustrate the complementary role played by sensor and social data, often intermediated by other Web based data and knowledge, using real-world examples in the domain of situational awareness, traffic monitoring, and healthcare. We also show how semantic techniques and technologies support critical data interoperability needs, advanced computation capabilities including reasoning, and significantly enhance our ability to exploit growing amount of data from the proliferation of Internet of Things.},

In this paper, the authors propose two innovations of tag anti-collision algorithm in EPC Gen 2 RFID Specification: i. the adaptive management of Q-parameter (to maximize the efficiency of the inventory procedure depending on the tags number) and its communication by a QueryAdjust command, and ii. the muting option, which silences the tags after their identification with the effect of reducing the offered load to the reader after each successful identification.},

abstract={Internet of Things devices are envisioned to penetrate essentially all aspects of life, including homes and urban spaces, in use cases such as health care, assisted living, and smart cities. One often proposed solution for dealing with the massive amount of data collected by these devices and offering services on top of them is the federation of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. However, user acceptance of such systems is a critical factor that hinders the adoption of this promising approach due to severe privacy concerns. We present UPECSI, an approach for user-driven privacy enforcement for cloud-based services in the Internet of Things to address this critical factor. UPECSI enables enforcement of all privacy requirements of the user once her sensitive data leaves the border of her network, provides a novel approach for the integration of privacy functionality into the development process of cloud-based services, and offers the user an adaptable and transparent configuration of her privacy requirements. Hence, UPECSI demonstrates an approach for realizing user-accepted cloud services in the Internet of Things.},

This expansion has led analysts and individual industrial companies to the prediction that a few tens of billions of devices will be deployed in the next decade in diverse industries such as automotive, utility, health, logistics and home automation. This growth in physical deployments and physical devices fuelled the development of cloud middleware for managing a large number of sensor data streams generated by the individual sensors. In this paper, we describe one such computational middleware, called IoT-Framework, built on open source components. The main objective of this framework is to disseminate the generated raw data streams as well as processed and fused streams to multiple interested parties. The IoT-Framework is using the RabbitMQ publish-subscribe system and the elasticsearch search and storage technology. In this paper we provide preliminary evaluation results on the performance of the combined operation of the two components.},

abstract={Nowadays, many researchers are interested in the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is evolving our knowledge and conception of the world. IoT aims to offer a common communication paradigm for all objects via the Internet and its protocols. For that reasons, it is being applied in all areas of life, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, military, cities management, and industry. One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN. An overview of the different management protocols for IPv6 is presented. Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and the considerations for IoT management from works such as Lightweight Network Management Protocol (LNMP), and the Constrained networks and devices Management (COMAN) Group from the IETF are discussed. COMAN is presenting solutions such as simplified MIB, new SNMP consideration, and CoAP-based management.},

Despite enormous development in ICT and cloud computing, there is still some technology development needed before such services can be applied into practice and penetrate into markets. One of the key components for IoT based mobile healthcare is an accurate, low-cost, and user-friendly physiological monitoring device. In this study, such an intelligent, unobtrusive conformable, user friendly physiological monitoring device is presented. In particular, the inkjet printing of silver nano-particle ink, NPS-JL from Harima Chemicals, is used to fabricate interconnections and a 2.4 GHz antenna on low-cost stretchable plastics. Interconnections between RF SoC and passive components are made with isotropic conductive adhesive. Finally, the platform is demonstrated as a `plaster' like sensor node that measures the ECG signal and transmits that in real-time to a mobile device using Bluetooth low-energy protocol. Up to 14 m reading distance was demonstrated using the printed antenna in a close vicinity of the body.},

abstract={The interaction between devices sharing the same frequency domain, but using different communication protocols, is an important issue prevalent to the Internet of Things (IoT). IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, protocols that overlap in applications such as home automation, health care and factory automation, is one such example. In these situations 802.11 networks are known to detrimentally interfere with 802.15.4 networks, degrading performance significantly. We show that the response to unsuccessful Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) is a large contributor to this degradation. Current responses do not distinguish between different transmission sources, employing the same response independent of the interferer type. However, as we show in this paper, it is beneficial to discriminate interferer types when performing CCA as this allows us to employ different strategies in handling occupied media. Our work considers in particular the low-power Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on the 802.15.4 standard. In such protocols, CCA is applied at the transmitter to arbitrate channel access, and also at the receiver for power efficient transmission detection. We present a protocol building block called Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (DCCA) which allows us to tailor the reaction to a busy channel depending on the nature of the interfering network type. We evaluate an implementation of DCCA for the ContikiMAC protocol on the Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP platform. The experimental evaluation shows that DCCA improves throughput of 802.15.4 networks in the presence of 802.11 networks significantly, ten-fold in some settings.},

pages={15:1-15:11},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a commerce-related architecture, the Smarter Commerce Customer Engagement Architecture (SCCEA). This architecture involves a new definition of the commerce lifecycle and an alternative metric for calculating customer experience and benefit, called customer lifetime benefit (CLB). Traditionally, commerce-related architectures have enabled the direct involvement and interaction between customers and companies from a purchasing, customer support center, or marketing perspective. These systems typically help measure financial success through the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric. SCCEA represents a shift in approaches from these architectures to one focused on the interactions with the products customers own and on how those products are operating. SCCEA analyzes the data gathered directly from the operations of products to make a determination of what actions can be taken to positively influence customer experience. SCCEA is realized through combining three foundational domains: Smarter Commerce™, Internet of Things, and Customer Engagement. The paper begins with a definition of the commerce lifecycle, followed by an overview of the three foundational domains. With this foundation established, the authors describe the SCCEA architecture, subsystems, and functional components. Finally, to help clarify the feasibility of the SCCEA approach, a representative scenario from the healthcare industry is presented.},

abstract={Social persuasion to influence the actions, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals, embedded in a social network, has been widely studied. It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.},

abstract={In-home healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have great business potential; however, a comprehensive platform is still missing. In this paper, an intelligent home-based platform, the iHome Health-IoT, is proposed and implemented. In particular, the platform involves an open-platform-based intelligent medicine box (iMedBox) with enhanced connectivity and interchangeability for the integration of devices and services; intelligent pharmaceutical packaging (iMedPack) with communication capability enabled by passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) and actuation capability enabled by functional materials; and a flexible and wearable bio-medical sensor device (Bio-Patch) enabled by the state-of-the-art inkjet printing technology and system-on-chip. The proposed platform seamlessly fuses IoT devices (e.g., wearable sensors and intelligent medicine packages) with in-home healthcare services (e.g., telemedicine) for an improved user experience and service efficiency. The feasibility of the implemented iHome Health-IoT platform has been proven in field trials.},

title={Measuring the long term impact on firm performance using ROA: An empirical study of RFID adoption},

pages={1-6},
abstract={In the era of the Internet of things, RFID (radio frequency identification) has attracted substantial interest of both managers and scholars. However, the unclear benefits of RFID and great risk make investors quite hesitant to invest in this disruptive and innovative technology. Prior research had employed the event study method to examine the short term market reaction of RFID adoption and found significant positive abnormal return. But whether RFID adoption can payback in the long run has not been addressed. In this paper, we extend previous research by using the ROA (Return on Assets) method to analyze the impact of RFID adoption on firm market value. We selected 74 publicly traded companies which were RFID adopters and there are altogether 108 adoption announcements ranging from 1997 to 2009. Then Pair T test of ROA had been conducted for each publicly traded company and its matching company. Other potential confounding factors are also considered such as the type of industry, timing of adoption, country, and firm characteristics such as level of diversification, financial health and growth potential. Altogether, there is no significant difference between RFID adopters and RFID non-adopters. Our result indicates that RFID's firm value has not been fully reflected in the long run. This may be attributed to its high cost and other uncertainties. The research in our paper may provide practical and academic implications.},

abstract={A main characteristic of the Internet of Things networks is the large number of resource-constrained nodes, which, however, are required to perform reliable and fast data exchange; often of critical nature; over highly unpredictable and dynamic connections and network topologies. Reducing the number of message exchanges and retransmission of data, while guaranteeing the lifetime of the data session duration as per service requirements are vital for enabling scenarios such as smart home, intelligent transportation systems, eHealth, etc. This paper proposes a novel theoretical model for the discovery, linking and interpretation of nodes in unstructured and resource-constrained network environments and their interrelated and collective use for the delivery of smart services. The model is based on a basic mathematical approach, which describes and predicts the success of human interactions in the context of long-term relationships and identifies several key variables in the context of communications in resource-constrained environments. The general theoretical model is described and several algorithms are proposed as part of the node discovery, identification, and linking processes in relation to the key variables. The algorithms are each evaluated by simulations to determine which parameters are key for optimal node grouping.},

abstract={Future Internet and Internet of Things are hot research topics mainly due to 2 enabling factors: the increasing use of wireless networks and the constant miniaturization of electrical devices. Both enablers have also empowered the development of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). In these networks various sensors are attached on clothing or on the body or even implanted under the skin. The wireless nature of the network and the wide variety of sensors offer numerous new, practical and innovative applications to improve health care and the Quality of Life. The sensors of a WBAN measure for example the heartbeat, the body temperature or record a prolonged electrocardiogram. Using a WBAN, the patient experiences a greater physical mobility and is no longer compelled to stay in the hospital. This paper offers a survey of the concept of Wireless Body Area Networks and presents a unique European initiative which offers access to a federated set of European Testbeds and Research Facilities in the area of Future Internet.},

IoT will be applied in different areas, e.g. smart cities, agriculture, energy, environment protection, health, home automation, etc. However, if different IoT applications are based on different architectures, this will prevent the IoT co-building, convergence, and openness. To reduce investments in the IoT area, a top-down architectural principles need to be followed to unify the design.

abstract={Despite the increasing usage of mobile communications, strengthened by the growing penetration of smartphones, end users seem to be concerned about the potential health risks of the electromagnetic fields (EMF) induced by such technologies, according to the latest statistics gathered by the Eurobarometer. The Low EMF Exposure Networks (LEXNET) project aims at designing techniques able to reduce the corresponding exposure, without jeopardizing the quality of experience perceived by the end-users. In order to tackle that goal, a first step must be to accurately estimate such exposure, even in large areas, and with real operating networks. This paper introduces the work that is being carried out to deploy a number of low-complexity dosimeters to characterize the EMF at four different bands. The devices exploit the facilities provided by a wireless sensor network testbed, and are therefore integrated as another IoT (Internet of Things) node. The preliminary measurements that are discussed in the paper assess the validity and feasibility of this novel methodology, which provides clear advantages to other traditional procedures, such as the use of drive tests and/or spectrum analyzers.},

Autonomous fault-tolerant systems are based on hardware capable of self-monitoring and self-repair. In this context, this paper investigates the use of fine-grained, partial dynamic reconfiguration on FPGA for achieving a higher degree of fault-tolerance with lower permanent overhead than TMR, its potential use for long term system maintenance and its capability of detecting faults quickly. The case study shown in this paper focuses mainly on accelerating fault-detection trough optimising a fault-monitoring strategy using an evolutionary algorithm (EA).},

Those sensors are able to communicate and share information and thus they have special requirements of storage, computation power and network. Cloud technology offers new services addressing the exponentially growing demands of IoT. We focus on innovation in developing Future Internet (FI) applications for motion sensor driven gesture recognition systems utilizing cloud technology and the FIWARE core platform. We propose an architecture for sensor driven FI applications and we present a motion sensor cloud service (namely Interact) that features a set of application enablers and cloud services to demonstrate the adaptation of new standards in FI-WARE. The proposed solution interprets hand language gesture signals and offers an open gesture database for third party developers creating new opportunities for SMEs to commercialize innovative products and services.

It is not just things connected to the Internet - it is intelligent systems that we will be able to build on top of IoT that will introduce us to a better quality of life. However, IoT is facing a major problem: fragmentation and interoperability problems. If we want things to communicate with each other, intelligently and autonomously, then the new future Internet must be structured to allow such thing. The industry must adopt current standards and provide interoperability among other systems and developers must be aware of this issue too. Every new device should be IoT proof for future integration in IoT.

abstract={Evolving from a mature body of research titled SoundScapes, this paper reports on a work-in-progress that is investigating the need that is evident for improved information and recommendation infrastructures to assist in healthcare intervention and communication (including apparatus and method). The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters. Through dissemination of the concept at this early phase of development in establishing the resource, an open invitation for peers and related interested parties to critique, advise, and otherwise contribute toward optimal development and wide impact - s offered.},

abstract={This manuscript reports on a work-in-progress project evolving aside from a main undertaking; that of making a commercial `Internet of Things' style product called “The Virtual Dressing Room (VDR)”. The project targets the process chain from designer and clothing manufacturer to retailer and end-user customers. The VDR has been subject of other publications, thus is introduced only briefly in this manuscript. VDR is a `non-groupware-based' project funded under the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation. A main goal at conception was reducing returns of online purchased apparel, which, at a reported approximately 40% is crippling the clothing industry. Results from public response surveys (including at The Scandinavian Health & Rehab Messe) to a VDR simulation system clearly indicated how the wheelchair-bound community perceived benefits from the system. This was unexpected and aside from the original VDR project design requisite. Interviews highlighted problems of high street fitting rooms not being sized to accommodate wheelchairs, and often so minimally sized as to not enable a second helping person to be present to support the involved undressing and dressing procedures. Existing online purchasing systems were also considered problematic including a need to improve social networking to enable others Online to view clothes considered for purchase to assist decision making. The production suffered problematic cooperation, coordination, communication, and collaboration that prevented early product. This resulted in additional surveys and the evolution of this additional work-in-progress. Following introducing the VDR, key issues such as interface design, body measurement, and cloth representation in the VDR is discussed. The finding of wheelchair-bound-need is envisioned as a next-generation iteration and is thus the focus of this contribution to position the work-in-progress and invite like-minded interested parties to collaborate to- ards optimization of a system to realize potentials.},

abstract={Cloud computing and Internet of things (IOT) technologies can support a new generation of PHR systems which are provided as cloud services that contain patient data (health and social) from various sources, including automatically transmitted data from Internet connected devices of patient living space (e.g. medical devices connected to patients at home care). In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},

abstract={In the future Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects will be the fundamental building blocks for the creation of cyber-physical smart pervasive systems in a great variety of application domains ranging from health-care to transportation, from logistics to smart grid and cities. The implementation of a smart objects-oriented IoT is a complex challenge as distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions and granularity need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. In this paper, we propose the integration of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: Agents and Cloud. Agent-based computing can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems. Cloud computing can enhance the IoT objects with high performance computing capabilities and huge storage resources. In particular, we introduce a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented IoT architecture that will be realized through ACOSO, an agent-oriented middleware for cooperating smart objects, and BodyCloud, a sensor-cloud infrastructure for large-scale sensor-based systems.},

abstract={With more and more applications of Internet of things (IoT) technologies, the quality of life of residents is one of the most important aspects in smart cities. Specially, home healthcare monitoring for the disabled and / or the elderly has become a focus of recent researches and developments. Existing home healthcare systems have drawbacks such as simple and few functionalities, weak interaction and poor mobility. This paper presents a home mobile healthcare (mHealth) system for wheelchair users, based on the emerging IoT technologies. The paper focuses on the proposed system architecture and the design of wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs). The nodes of WBSNs include wireless heart rate and ECG sensors, wireless pressure detecting cushion, home environment sensing nodes and control actuators. A prototype system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient in monitoring human activities and in interacting with the living environment.},

abstract={As a key enabler of Internet of things, cellular network based Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications have been growing rapidly in recent years, being used in a wide range of services such as security, metering, health, remote control, tracking, and so on. A critical issue in M2M communications is the energy efficiency as typically the machine devices are powered by batteries of low capacity and thus, it is the key to optimize their consumption. To achieve higher energy efficiency, this paper proposes the adoption of contexts through a generic context-aware framework for M2M communications. With this framework, machine devices dynamically adapt their settings depending on a series of characteristics such as data reporting mode, QoS features, and network conditions to achieve higher energy efficiency and extend the operating lifetime of M2M networks. Simulation results are provided for four commonly used M2M applications. The results demonstrate considerable energy savings and operating lifetime extension on the network when the proposed context-aware framework is used. Thus, it is shown that contexts play an important role on the energy efficiency of M2M systems.},

abstract={With Internet of Things applications covering several application domains (e.g., Smart Grid, Smart City, e-Health) with a diverse range of requirements, it is now becoming increasingly recognized that the variety of wireless technologies employed for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is here to stay. Due to the heterogeneity of M2M appliances and communication modes, research has been investigating autonomic principles as an efficient instrument for the integration of large populations of dissimilar M2M devices to the M2M gateway and the overall end-to-end M2M architecture. Herein we present the status of semantic support for the IoT field by briefly surveying research efforts in IoT dealing with semantic concerns at the architecture level. We also summarize the state of the art in adaptable protocol stacks and make the case for their application as an efficiency enabler instrument for IoT. To this end, we present our work in an ontology used to semantically describe the adaptation options of the dynamic protocol stacks for future communication devices. We present the ontology design principles and artifacts and elaborate on the level of semantic support it enables for IoT. Finally, we conclude the paper with our next steps in the area of semantic support for IoT.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) makes all objects become interconnected and smart, which has been recognized as the next technological revolution. As its typical case, IoT-based smart rehabilitation systems are becoming a better way to mitigate problems associated with aging populations and shortage of health professionals. Although it has come into reality, critical problems still exist in automating design and reconfiguration of such a system enabling it to respond to the patient's requirements rapidly. This paper presents an ontology-based automating design methodology (ADM) for smart rehabilitation systems in IoT. Ontology aids computers in further understanding the symptoms and medical resources, which helps to create a rehabilitation strategy and reconfigure medical resources according to patients' specific requirements quickly and automatically. Meanwhile, IoT provides an effective platform to interconnect all the resources and provides immediate information interaction. Preliminary experiments and clinical trials demonstrate valuable information on the feasibility, rapidity, and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

abstract={The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it possible for connecting various smart objects together through the Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to become a technology revolution with a vision of creating very large scale network, comprising of unprecedented number of connected devices. These devices, often referred to as smart items or intelligent things can be home appliances, healthcare devices, vehicles, buildings, factories and almost anything networked and fitted with sensors, actuators, embedded computers. There has been sustained research work and standardization effort from different IoT perspectives like integration of sensor and RFID devices to the Internet. With the increasing trend of gathering business insights from unstructured data, the high volume of data generated by such devices is also of interest. Cloud based data mining platforms are suitable for analyses of such data and researchers have proposed architectures where personal mobile phones can act as Edge Gateway between the sensor network and cloud analytics platform. It seems that the surge in the volume of data generated by huge number of Smart Items can only be matched if a large percentage of mobile users start sharing the computation capability of their personal devices and work together towards true Participatory Computing in the IoT systems. In this work we try to understand the challenges associated with running computation jobs on the mobile devices using different types of workload often observed in IoT applications. Based on the insights gained from experiments performed by us, we propose a scheme where mobile phones, residential gateways and other edge devices offer free slots to servers in a cloud based data analytics system. Based on the free time slots offered by the mobile phones, if commensurately sized computational jobs can be scheduled, the unpredictability associated with using mobile phones as grid resources can be solved.},

abstract={The Web in the Internet today—especially when it comes to the Internet of Things and cloud computing—is the Web of resources. A photo album, an appointment calendar, a telephone bill, a health record are all resource examples, listed here in the increasing order of expected privacy protection. A few properties of these resources define the roles of three major actors: The resources belong to their owner, they are hosted by the service provider, and they increasingly need to be shared (say, to support mash-up) with consumers. Owners authorize consumers' access to their resources, which providers then grant to the consumers upon authenticating them and checking for proper authorization. In the past, this was achieved by maintaining an access control list for each resource at the service provider. Typically, such a list specifies all consumers along with their privileges. Emerging trends in social networking and cloud computing require elasticity, or, in other words, the ability to grant resource access to new consumers on the fly. Naturally, this comes with ever-increasing requirements for privacy, which dictate strong authentication of all actors involved as well as cryptographic protection of the involved communication sessions. We share the industry expectation that the technology that solves the above problem will be a major enabler for applications based on technologies that range from social networking, to video-on-demand, to health care, to smart metering, and—especially—to cloud computing. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies, including the emerging Open Authorization Protocol (OAuth) 2.0, and presents our own solution in this space, which removes an intermediary and gives the owner of a resource immediate control over defining access to that resource.},

The IoT paradigm is bridging the real world with its virtual image, where devices located in different areas could exchange information each other without any type of supervision or control. But, spite of all the benefits that IoT could bring to society, the security of the information as well as privacy must be strongly enforced and managed in this new environment with unique characteristics.

The M2M devices provide a great deal of M2M data, mainly used for specific M2M applications such as weather forecasting, healthcare or building automation. Existing applications are domain-specific and use their own descriptions of devices and measurements. A major challenge is to combine M2M data provided by these heterogeneous domains and by different projects. It is really a difficult task to understand the meaning of the M2M data to later reason about them. We propose a semantic-based approach to automatically combine, enrich and reason about M2M data to provide promising cross-domain M2M applications. A proof-of-concept to validate our approach is published online (http://sensormeasurement.appspot.com/).},

abstract={As Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a growing reality, more ubiquitous devices are embedded in our daily lives, serving us in a broad range of purposes in everyday life from: personal healthcare to home automation to tailored smart city services. These devices primarily collect data that is about or produced by people, be it street noise level of a neighbourhood, or the energy footprint of an individual's home or her location and other situational context. As this unprecedented amount of data is collected, we are challenged with one fundamental research question: who owns this data and who should have access to it? Specifically, the emergent of the Human Data Interaction (HDI) topic which aims to put the human at the centre of the data driven industry, calls attention to the IoT community to address the data ownership aspect more carefully. In this note, we offer a reflection on the challenges that IoT faces in regards to the data ownership in HDI and advocate the roles that both ordinary people and industries must play to best answer those challenges in shaping the IoT landscape.},

The main contribution of this work is a time-dependent factorial hidden Markov model to extract behaviour related features linked with individual appliance usage. The results show that the introduced time-dependent structure can improve the performance while also provide a probability distribution related to ADLs.

abstract={To alleviate the air pollution problem caused by vehicle emissions, different vehicle inspection programs have been introduced, in which vehicles are examined by undergoing a number of emission tests. However, these emission tests are usually cost-ineffective and time-consuming. It is also difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new vehicle emission inspection and notification system to help daily monitoring of engine health through the concept of Internet of Things. As there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area, they are employed to play an important role in the proposed system. By the fact that every car must stop in front of red lights, reliable reading of air ratio (λ) from a vehicle, which indicates the engine emission status, can be interrogated wirelessly through mature and low-price radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. By inspecting the λ in real time, the vehicle emissions can be effectively controlled by the governmental authorities. Meanwhile, several implementation issues have also been considered and analyzed in this paper. An innovative method is proposed to select the appropriate traffic lights on which RFID monitoring devices should be installed.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare (U-healthcare) systems are expected to offer flexible and resilient high-end technological solutions enabling remote monitoring of patients health status in real-time and provisioning of feedback and remote actions by healthcare providers. In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},

abstract={The medication noncompliance problem has caused serious threat to public health as well as huge financial waste would wide. The emerging pervasive healthcare enabled by the Internet-of-Things offers promising solutions. In addition, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS) is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demands for daily monitoring and on-site diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive medication management solution is proposed based on intelligent and interactive packaging (I2Pack) and intelligent medicine box (iMedBox). The intelligent pharmaceutical packaging is sealed by the Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by wireless communication. Various vital parameters can also be collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the wireless link. On-site diagnosis and prognosis of these vital parameters are supported by the high performance architecture. Additionally, friendly user interface is emphasized to ease the operation for the elderly, disabled, and patients. A prototyping system of the I2Pack and iMedBox is implemented and verified by field trials.},

abstract={In-home healthcare services based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have great business potentials. To turn it into reality, a business ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should therefore aim for a cooperative ecosystem by meeting the interoperability, security, and system integration requirements. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform-based in-home healthcare terminal. A cooperative business ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. To support the ecosystem in practical technology and business development, ecosystem-driven standardization efforts, security mechanisms, terminal design principles, and data handling schemes are analyzed and corresponding solutions or guidelines are presented. Thirdly, to verify the proposed design strategy and guidelines, an open-platform-based terminal is implemented and demonstrated by a prototyping system.},

abstract={In the new era of Internet of Things, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can provide a new way of communication between the Virtual and the Real World. However, mobility has become more and more important in flat WSNs allowing them to expand to new concepts and extending their applicability. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to control losses and support quality of service in these mobile environments. In fact, this is very important for monitoring people's health conditions in hospitals, in military scenarios and in dangerous industrial environments. However, so that an end-user application can take advantage of a mobility scenario, a low level mobile protocol should be implemented in a transparent way for applications. This article presents the implementation details and some evaluation studies of two mobility models for WSNs: one based on the well-known MIPv6 and another one based on our previous work in draft-silva-6lowpan-mipv6.},

abstract={The recent trend of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things demands everyday objects to be IP addressable and Internet accessible. This brings forward the challenges of converting or mapping formerly isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to be IP compatible. IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is one of the first protocols which provide IP compatibility to low data rate WSNs. While 6LoWPAN is efficient for WSNs, there are other limitations such as different physical layers and radio interfaces which will break the information flow between heterogeneous IP-compatible networks and the Internet. In this paper, an integrated hardware/software solution is presented to bridge two heterogeneous 6LoWPAN networks. It is motivated by the necessity of merging a body area network and an environment control network in typical health monitoring applications of an intelligent environment. The unification is achieved through use of a physical serial bus, making a single hybrid router with the capability to route packets across both networks. The commonalities between two 6LoWPAN implementations allow highly efficient packet translation between two network stacks. Internet connectivity was added though use of an edge router, and allows each node to be addressed and accessed directly from anywhere on the Internet.},

Here, we focus on demonstrating a “software to data” provisioning solution to propose a mapping of FI application use case requirements to software specifications (using GEs). The aim is to establish a provider to consumer cloud setting wherein no sensitive data will be exchanged but it will reside at the back-end site.

These networks can also be integrated into the "Internet of Things" in order to allow collaboration and wider access to sensor data.

However, the social needs of the empty nesters have been less supported in smart home designs. A compelling story about the elderly can make the adult children emotionally attached to their elderly parents and establish a healthy social connection between them. In this work, we propose a data-driven story generation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT based techniques enable the real time collection of the elderly's environment data through various sensors located in the home. The story generation system can weave the information mined from the sensor data into a story with high persuasive and emotion arousing power. Our system automatically collects raw sensor data on the cloud server and maps them to values of semantically meaningful context variables through activity functions. A director agent organizes the story plot with a Goal Net based approach and dynamically generates storylines based on a set of scene selection rules. The proposed system is carefully studied with a simulated smart home environment.},

abstract={The current emphasis on sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems, more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems”, has the potential to give rise to a new generation of systems and services encompassing several domains such as e-Governance, healthcare, transportation, waste management, energy & utilities, insurance, etc., resulting in the metamorphosis of the Internet as we see it, into the Internet of Things (IoT). One probable commonality in each of these services will be the abundance of different types of data from different sources with the success of the systems depending on real-time or near real-time analysis of data. Such analyses are normally performed via well-known algorithms with a time-constraint on the execution, thus creating a requirement for parallel execution techniques. Some of these analyses may have a higher frequency of execution on a relatively small set of data, in which case the current big-data frameworks may actually add an overhead. Further, the frameworks like Hadoop demand the algorithms to be mapped onto a particular paradigm, which may not always be a suitable option. This paper, which is a work-in-progress, provides an experience report on the use of Condor, a well known Grid framework, for data-parallel “black-box” style execution of analysis algorithms in the context of Internet of Things. We concentrate on algorithms which are already in use, and can be partitioned into data-parallel subtasks without any modification and use Condor, which has traditionally been used for high-performance or high-throughput computing, as the execution framework.},

This security architecture is aimed to be used with a mobile e-health application (m-health) through a simple and intuitive interface, supported by RFID technology. This architecture, able to support secured and authenticated interactions, will enable an easy deployment of m-health applications.

Therefore, M2M, by featuring smart monitoring devices, have started to play key role in different sectors, namely, Smart-Grid, Smart-Health, Smart-City, Smart-Electronic-Vehicle, etc. Consequently, numerous device-manufacturers and service-providers have arrived to resolve the increasing demand of personalized smart-devices and services. Traditional management technique is unable to scale up to such growth on M2M networks and services. In this context, we have developed an Autonomic M2M Management System that can learn to scale up to the personalized service-requirements. We have proposed and developed Psychic, an autonomic inference engine, that is capable to learn personalized service-recommendation by inferring service-usage from environmental (such as different locations, weather, time, etc.) and emotional Information(such as happiness, sadness, etc.) of users. A case-study by E-mail survey with 77 people and by traffic-analysis of 16 people's smart-device usage, is performed to evaluate the functionality of the developed system.},

abstract={Rapid technological advancement in wireless sensor networks has contributed for the great increase in number of IP-connected smaller smart sensors that, in turn, become part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient utilization of the IoT for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication requires security. The IETF 6L0WPAN standard provides the mechanism for IPv6 packet transmission over low-power wireless personal area networks. Thus, the interconnection of wireless sensor devices to the Internet facilitates the M2M communication with many application areas such as smart grid, metering, health, environment, vehicle and home appliances. M2M communication over the 6L0WPAN has security challenges as a result of the greater number of 61owpan devices, smaller packet transmission, low power, low processing and various application areas. In order to secure the subsequent M2M communication over the 6L0WPAN, secure authentication and session key exchange schemes among the communicating parties are needed. Therefore, in this paper we propose SAKES - a secure authentication and key establishment scheme - for the M2M communication in the 6L0WPAN. The security analysis is done for different attack scenarios. The impact of DoS attack in the performance of the 6L0WPAN is evaluated. The evaluation is carried out by using OPNET simulation tool. Our simulation result showed the severity of DoS attack and the necessity of the proposed security scheme so as to maintain the constrained resources.},

abstract={We are witnessing increasing penetration of pervasive computing into business and personal environments. Its advances, among other things, enable new opportunities for better health services but, as a side effect, it introduces new threats to privacy. If anywhere, it is in the health care sector that privacy is of utmost importance. Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most "primitive" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning. This latter contribution also paves the way for further development and for applications of pervasive computing in general.},

This application has been tested in a gymnasium with real, non-simulated nodes and devices. A Graphic User Interface has been implemented to suggest a series of exercises to improve a sportsman/woman s condition, depending on the context and their profile.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},

It comes out a problem that how to manage and control these increasing various appliances efficiently and conveniently so as to achieve more comfortable, security and healthy space at home. In this paper, a smart control system base on the technologies of internet of things has been proposed to solve the above problem. The smart home control system uses a smart central controller to set up a radio frequency 433 MHz wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN). A series of control modules, such as switch modules, radio frequency control modules, have been developed in the WSAN to control directly all kinds of home appliances. Application servers, client computers, tablets or smart phones can communicate with the smart central controller through a wireless router via a Wi-Fi interface. Since it has WSAN as the lower control layer, a appliance can be added into or withdrawn from the control system very easily. The smart control system embraces the functions of appliance monitor, control and management, home security, energy statistics and analysis.},

Healthcare is once such industry where the Internet of Things may provide great advantages to patients, care givers, and medical institutions. As the number of radio frequency emitters increases under this new paradigm public health and safety must also be taken into account. This paper explores the electromagnetic interference on implantable cardiac rhythm management devices caused by RFID interrogators.

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},

In IoT@Work we focus on the potential of making manufacturing environments more agile and flexible. We explain how the IoT-centric architecture for manufacturing also needs a deep understanding of the manufacturing system and its state today.

Firstly, the requirements of human centric web of things application are described. Then the active linked data with data, task, context, computational organization, knowledge, presentation and interaction models is defined by extending the conventional linked data. Based on the active linked data models, we propose a semantic Web of Things framework, which leverages multiagent technologies to facilitate human-to-human and human-to-machine collaborations. Finally, a sample case on care coordination and ubiquitous health service roaming is given.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that envisions all objects around us as part of internet. IoT coverage is very wide and include variety of objects like smart phones, tablets, digital cameras, sensors, etc. Once all these devices are connected with each other, they enable more and more smart processes and services that support our basic needs, economies, environment and health. Such enormous number of devices connected to internet provides many kinds of services and produce huge amount of data and information. Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. compute, networks, servers, storage, applications, services, and software) that can be easily provisioned as Infrastructure (IaaS), software and applications (SaaS). Cloud based platforms help to connect to the things (IaaS) around us so that we can access anything at any time and any place in a user friendly manner using customized portals and in built applications (SaaS). Hence, cloud acts as a front end to access Internet of Things. Applications that interact with devices like sensors have special requirements of massive storage to storage big data, huge computation power to enable the real time processing of the data, and high speed network to stream audio or video. In this paper, we describe how Internet of Things and Cloud computing can work together can address the Big Data issues. We also illustrate about Sensing as a service on cloud using few applications like Augmented Reality, Agriculture and Environment monitoring.

abstract={The Internet of Things vision foresees billions of devices to connect the physical world to the digital world. Sensing applications such as structural health monitoring, surveillance or smart buildings employ multi-hop wireless networks with high density to attain sufficient area coverage. Such applications need networking stacks and routing protocols that can scale with network size and density while remaining energy-efficient and lightweight. To this end, the IETF RoLL working group has designed the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This paper discusses the problems of link quality estimation and neighbor management policies when it comes to handling high densities. We implement and evaluate different neighbor management policies and link probing techniques in Contiki's RPL implementation. We report on our experience with a 100-node testbed with average 40-degree density. We show the sensitivity of high density routing with respect to cache sizes and routing metric initialization. Finally, we devise guidelines for design and implementation of density-scalable routing protocols.},

abstract={The rapid increase in vehicle fleet size and consequently in traffic volume is not always followed by an increase in road space. As a result, traffic congestion occurs, especially in large urban areas. Therefore, in order to avoid traffic jams, immediate solutions have to be found. Various technologies have been used to design and develop such solutions in the past. While some developers have used classic technologies, others have integrated various emerging technologies in the systems they built in order to make roadways safer. Acting both inside the vehicle and along the roadways the new designed systems are able to inform drivers about traffic conditions and possible hazards. This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based approach to solve some of the problems that traffic congestion raises. Furthermore, this approach provides the means to monitor a set of environmental parameters, including air quality, and to raise early warnings and alarms when critical levels are reached. This approach offers a solution to increasing traffic-related pollution (which has a negative impact on the environment and on people's health), to economic losses and to other issues caused by traffic congestions. In order to reduce accident risks when various intervention vehicles enter the cross-roads, we also propose a solution based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.},

abstract={Our society changes so fast, more and more people have focused on the study of wireless communication technique because of its scalability, low cost and continent deploy. Nowadays, both Wireless Wide Area Network and Wireless Personal Area Network has been given a lot of concern and research. Wireless Sensor Network integrated the wireless communication technique, sensor technology and computer technology, is the foundation of "The Internet of things" and tops the list of ten technology which has profound impact on human future life. WSN has been widely used on military defence, anti-terrorism, health and environmental monitoring, and it has improved the connection between human, machine and environment to a new level. Obviously, all these appalication need the WSN to be lower power consumption, rapid topology, good real-time and so on. Above all, low power consumption bears the brunt. In order to improve the performance of the network and increase the lifetime of the network, we need to lower the power consumption of sensor node in the wireless sensor network. In this paper, an improved AODV routing protocol based on minimal route cost is presented, and OPNET is used to simulate the throughput, end-to-end delay and other parameters for evaluating the performance of the wireless sensor network with the improved protocol, the simulated results show the validation of the presented improved AODV.},

abstract={Recent vehicular networking activities include public vehicle to vehicle/infrastructure (V2X) large scale deployment, machine-to-machine (M2M) integration scenarios and more automotive applications. eHealth is about the use of the Internet to disseminate health related information, and is one of the promising Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Combining vehicular networking and eHealth to record and transmit a patient's vital signs is a special telemedicine application that helps hospital resident health professionals to optimally prepare the patient's admittance. From the automotive perspective, this is a typical Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication scenario. This proposal provides an IPv6 vehicular platform which integrates eHealth devices and allows sending captured health-related data to a Personal Health Record (PHR) application server in the IPv6 Internet. The collected data is viewed remotely by a doctor and supports a diagnostic decision. This paper introduces the integration of vehicular and eHealth testbeds, describes related work and presents a lightweight auto-configuration method based on a DHCPv6 extension to provide IPv6 connectivity for resource constrained devices.},

In this paper, we study privacy preserving data communication between patients and an online healthcare provider (referred to as vendor) for efficient remote healthcare monitoring (RHM) in a smart community environment. We adopt patients' attribute structures instead of their identities for authentication and preserve identity privacy during patient-to-vendor communication, and we build a receiver chain among smart homes to enable vendor-to-patient communication and achieve location privacy.

So far, IEEE 802 Task Group has published a new IEEE 802.15.6 standard. The standard defines a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer supporting three Physical (PRY) layers. The three PRY layers are narrowband (NB) PRY, ultra wideband (UWB) PRY and human body communication (RBC) PRY. In this paper, the concept and applications of WBAN are introduced; comparisons between 802.11, 802.15.1, 802.15.4 and 802.15.6 are made; and a brief description about the three PRY layers specifications is given.

abstract={A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.},

abstract={Embedded intelligence entails a vision of the Internet of Things oriented to "Ambient Intelligence", which can be defined as the capacity to collect and analyze the digital traces left by people when they interact with the environment and with such "intelligent things". In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},

Nowadays there are several researches that are studying the application of the IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm in the e-health field. This paper explains how a solution, built on the top of the VIRTUS IoT middleware, provides a valid alternative to current IoT solutions, which are mainly based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). VIRTUS leverage an Instant Messaging protocol (XMPP) to guarantee a (near) real-time, secure and reliable communication channel among heterogeneous devices. The presented development has been exploited in a healthcare case study: an implementation of a cost-savvy remote body movement monitoring system, aimed at classify daily patients' activities, designed as a modular architecture and deployed in a large scale scenario.

abstract={Intelligent artifacts are real-world objects enhanced with capabilities in order to display relevant behavior in various types of context-aware applications, such as in mHealth, commerce, or pervasive games. This can be achieved by attaching sensors and store associated information on the Internet. Interaction with such artifacts requires secure communication, to protect personal and private information. This mandates research in how to safeguard interactions via heterogeneous means of communication involving interconnected local and non-local artifacts. In response to these challenges, this paper presents key schemes to secure interaction via heterogeneous means of communication. In conclusion, the architecture can securely authenticate an intelligent artifact as well as securely exchange sensor information with other authenticated artifacts attached in an overlay.

abstract={In the era of globalization, new businesses led companies to be everywhere in the world to respond for the new needs of gaining new markets and enforce its existence in acquired ones in order to stay in living in extreme competitions that do not recognize countries boundaries. Web Services technologies responded quickly to help such evolution and in many situations the Web Services application is driving businesses and dictating a new way of doing business. In this paper, we present an ideal model for developing web servers for small organizations by including search engine optimization techniques such as the best set of keywords from the search results of the Top-k Keyword Proximity Organic Searches and from the results of Similar Keyword Searches and Image Searches. We analyze the database of the web services to discover the customers' preferences, demographics, and demand patterns and trends. Also, we discuss the Quality of Services (QoS) of the Web services including the areas of Trust and Reputation, Security, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), and the Reliability and Performance. Our prototypes and studies could be applied to improve the global Search Marketing (SM) of enterprise websites in small organizations in areas of business, health, government, education, library and many others. Furthermore, we address the future trends of the Web Server developments as the Internet of Things (IOT) or Machine to Machine (M2M) in contrast with the existing Internet for the connection of people. The scale of the IOT or M2M will be several orders of magnitude larger than that of the current Internet, and it will drive the largest organic growth opportunity in the history of business.},

In particular, we focus our investigation on the transition phase happening during network topology changes; in fact, during these events it is challenging to satisfy such functional requirements as promptness and availability.

abstract={After the burst of the dot-com bubble in the Fall of 2001, the Internet has become a participative medium, which allows users to interact with one another and with the services from anywhere and at any time. The potential of such a change is still to be fully exploited, and phenomena such as social networks and cloud computing are just two of the many innovative solutions that have been born from the Web 2.0. At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality. Finally, we describe a typical HealthCare application for the IoT realized using WebIoT.},

abstract={Real-time and distributed sensing of large amounts of data, environmental, social or other, collected by very small and low-cost sensors is becoming a critical feature in more and more applications. In this paper, we are demonstrating with our developed prototypes that it is possible to deploy Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes in-between prototype sensors and the Internet gateways. As a proof of concept, sensors in location tracking, health monitoring and secure identity verification applications are enhanced with essential WSN features. These sensing devices can be considered as some of the first Internet-of-Things nodes that bring the ubiquitous cognition vision closer and closer.},

abstract={Internet technology provides various services via network. With the diversification of terminals and development of internet technology, internet technology has come into the stage of Next Generation Network(NGN) technology. Comparing with the current Internet technology that provides services in the imaginary space, the technology on Internet of Things (IOT) is based on real word. It links things together via sensors and wireless communication technology to collect a variety of information on the condition of people and their surrounding space in the real world. The combination of Internet technology and Technology on IOT integrates physical world and imaginary space on a shared platform to eliminate the constraints of imaginary space and provide intricate, diverse, and advanced services focusing on people, which have not been achieved [1]. The future direction for the integration of Internet technology and technology on IOT, the technology of body sensor network and information services are suggested.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and evolving concept that provides connectivity to the Internet via sensing devices to achieve intelligent identification and management in a heterogeneous connectivity environment. From the assisted living perspective, this emerging concept will enable new communication connectivity routes between elderly disabled patient and care services through innovative networking architectures in AAL environments. M-health is defined as "mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care" [1]. This evolutionary concept provides both mobility and 'always connected' functionalities for different healthcare applications. In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services. In this paper we will present a general m-IoT architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology for measurement of body temperature as an example for healthcare application.},

abstract={Recently, IPTV has become a convergent infrastructure for entertainment and communications services in our daily life. An IPTV set-top-box is now an important device in the Internet-of-things of each home. It is expected that this infrastructure would be suitable for emergency alert systems (EAS), especially in disaster and health-care scenarios. In this paper, we first review the recent developments to support emergency scenarios, including related IPTV standards and research in smart home. Then we propose an architecture for full-duplex emergency alert services based on IPTV platform. In order to maintain a very high availability of service, the key features of the architecture include the redundancy of devices and network connections and the scalability of data.},

abstract={With the emergence of the Internet of Things and improvement of humans' living standards, smart home is becoming the future criterion of home life. Smart home not only gives users a safe, healthy and comfortable living environment, but also allows users to remotely monitor their home state and control home appliances. However, the current smart home systems, including home gateways, wireless sensor network devices and the home networking equipments require constant work. This will not only cause a waste of energy, still can negatively affect the gateway performance. In order to save energy and reduce the cost of smart home, there is a pressing need for a new type of intelligent home control system. This paper presents a new type of intelligent home control system, using Android Phone as a temporary home gateway instead of the default home gateway, thus reducing the constant working hours of the traditional gateway. At the same time, we also construct an intelligent control system based on user behavior analysis, the system will automatically shut down the unused devices by predicting user behavior, so as to achieve energy savings and reduce costs.},

In this paper, we investigate the application of IoT in the area of pervasive medicine. We propose a practical network architecture for local medicine and health system based on GSM/3G/Internet infrastructure and Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN), called Community Medical Networks (CMN). CMN needs lower cost for deployment, supports user's mobility, can reduce the time and cost of diagnosis and treatment of diseases (especially chronic/paroxysmal diseases) as well as realizes individualization (patient-centered), cooperation and data-sharing in a distributed manner. We describe the implementation of CMN in detail in application level and operation level (business model). We also analyze the requirement of traffic related parameters of CMN when using WCDMA and Zigbee-based WBASN. A promising use case of CMN for heart disease is given to illustrate the feasibility, economical and social benefit of implementing CMN in typical Chinese cities.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework.},

abstract={Vehicle emissions including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) closely relate to air-ratio called lambda (λ) among all of the engine variables. Higher λ value indicates a significant amount of emissions harmful to our environment is produced and hence engine maintenance, particularly the catalytic converter, is necessary. Mandatory vehicle examination cannot be taken easily for each car, so it is difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Traffic lights considered as “Things” through the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) can be applied because there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area. In addition, cars must stop on red lights so that reliable λ reading can be interrogated wirelessly through radio frequency identification (RFID). Simulation results show that the proposed application can effectively control and reduce vehicle emissions.},

abstract={Providing effective and appropriate healthcare is one of the most important objectives of information and communication technologies (ICT). Internet of things (IoT) is one of the last advances in ICT, providing a global connectivity and management of sensors, devices, users and information. Our contribution is a solution to examine drug related problems based on IoT technologies, i.e. smart phones and Web to support ubiquitous Access, 6LoWPAN technology to support ubiquitous data collection of patients, sensors and hospitals, and RFID/NFC to support global identification. These technologies offer a wide range of applications in healthcare, which improves the quality of services, reduce mistakes, and even detect health anomalies from vital signs. This paper presents how IoT technology is applied in a pharmaceutical system to examine drugs in order to detect Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR), harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, complications and contraindications related with liver and renal defects, and harmful side effects during pregnancy or lactation. Thereby, the system provides an enhanced approach assisting physicians in clinical decisions and drug prescribing. The solution presented is based on NFC (Near Field Communication) and barcode identification technologies, which have been integrated in common devices such as smart-phones, PDAs and PCs. The drug ID is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a specific drug is suitable with respect to the patient's health record or not.},

abstract={There is a growing interest in leveraging Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) in domains such as home automation, automotive, mobile phones or e-Health. With the basic idea (supported in e.g. OSGi) that components provide services, it makes it possible to smoothly integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) with the Internet of Services (IoS). The paradigm of the IoS indeed offers interesting capabilities in terms of dynamicity and interoperability. However in domains that involve “things” (e.g. appliances), there is still a strong need for loose coupling and a proper separation between types and instances that are well-known in Component-Based approaches but that typical SOA fail to provide. This paper presents how we can still get the best of both worlds by augmenting SOA with a Component-Based approach. We illustrate our approach with a case study from the domain of home automation.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

pages={809-812},
abstract={The incidence of serious and fatal Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR) and harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients in worldwide hospitals is extremely high. Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.},

abstract={Recently the problem of providing effective and appropriate healthcare to elderly and disable people is an important field in relative to the aging of population problems. The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},

Household appliances communicate to each other and to local energy supply systems (e.g. photo voltaic or wind) to optimize energy usage and costs, order run out groceries independently and monitor our state of health. Personal robots overtake obnoxious tasks for us, entertain our kids and us, and surveil our homes against any hazard. Every object in the future factories is able to exchange data, work pieces may choose discretely their optimal process route and machines report maintenance issues betimes.

It is anticipated that the ratio of connected things to people will rise sharply over the next 5-10 years, to around 7:1 or even higher, which means that there would be 50 billion or even more connected things. The GSM Association believes the number could grow to 24 billion by 2020 [1], while Gartner forecasts that number to be 35 billion [2].

abstract={In recent years, IoT has become a fashionable jargon in the information and communication discipline. Despite the huge enthusiasm, most IoT deployments are restricted to dealing with automatic collection of data that has so far been collected manually. As such, for many people, connecting to the IoT does not bring any tangible benefit. In addition, connecting to the Internet of Things require special knowledge which common people do not possess. We believe that in order to be successful, the evolution of IoT should emphasize on participation of common people. Also, that the power of this technology will be more meaningfully exploited if it can be deployed in gathering the information that has so far been hidden around us. With such objectives, currently, we are working on developing a new generation IoT platform that we name as KIBAN. In addition, we have been conducting experiments on novel applications of IoT in the domains of food, agriculture, health and welfare. The speech will introduce KIBAN and such applications along with some projections into the future.},

abstract={In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such valida- ions span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of Dny for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental conce},

abstract={Summary form only given. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is a novel design paradigm, envisioned as a network of billions or trillions of machines communicating with one another and rapidly gaining global attention from academia, industry, and government. Pervasive computing is at the heart of IoT and forms a fundamental building block necessary to realize the IoT. Equipped with pervasive technologies such as RFID and ‘smart dust’ in addition to sensors, actuators and machine-to-machine devices, IoT has the potential to offer innovative solutions to global challenges faced by ageing populations, climate change, growing cost of healthcare as well as how we manage our environment and natural resources. The heterogeneous nature of the IoT as well as the computational constraints of many of the building blocks of the IoT make security, privacy and trust a challenging problem to solve on the one hand, while security, privacy and trust play a critical role for most if not all applications of IoT in domains such as surveillance, healthcare, security, transport, food safety, manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management. Without effective solutions for security, privacy and trust reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-aware intelligence and enhanced user acceptance and experience cannot be achieved.},

abstract={Summary form only given. The idea of an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is currently captivating both technologists and society at large. Although IoT techniques have their roots in ideas that are decades old, their increasingly widespread deployments have made them a hot topic these days, frequently discussed and hyped. As many as 50B networked devices are envisioned by 2020, and proponents of IoTs see a world where embedded sensing and control techniques help vehicle traffic flow more smoothly, where environmental sensing and data analysis facilitates better use of natural resources like water, and where personalized health monitoring helps individuals improve their quality of life. On the other hand, properly addressing policy concerns around security and privacy may play a role in IoT's adoption and success. My talk will discuss key technology and policy challenges for future IoT applications and devices. Overall, I will be drawing from both technical experiences and trends, as well as from policy perspectives gained during a one year fellowship doing technology policy within the U. S. Department of State.},

abstract={The recent spectacular progress in the microelectronic, information, communication, material and sensor technologies created a big stimulus towards development of smart communicating cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS connected to Internet started to form the Internet of Things (IoT) that is undergoing an explosive growth. In 2013 there were approximately 12.1 billion internet-connected devices, and their number is expected to more than quadruple to nearly 50 billion devices by 2025. Modern mobile systems constitute a very important subclass of CPS. Examples of such systems include automotive and transportation systems, mobile equipment transported by people or animals (including wearable or implantable systems), mobile robots, etc. For the CPS and IoT chip market as high as 30% annual growth rate is predicted for the period 2013-2020 (Gartner, Oct. 2014) that will be mainly driven by the need for low-power embedded processing, communications and sensing for mobile CPS sectors like smart automotive, wireless communication and wearables, with smart healthcare wearables growing at 65% a year to $41 billion in 2020 (Soreon Research, Oct. 2014).},

abstract={A new industrial revolution is underway, driven by the integration of creative digital technologies into large-scale physical systems, creating intelligent systems that can operate more efficiently and improve quality of life. The best-known example of such an intelligent system is the smart grid. The same technologies that enabled the smart grid are being applied to many other types of physical systems. Intelligent systems are rapidly emerging in transportation, buildings, other energy infrastructures (e.g., gas, oil, and water), manufacturing, emergency response, and health care. Of course, the smart grid provides an essential foundation since all types of intelligent systems depend on reliable and high-quality electricity to power their operation. Various writers use terms such as cyberphysical systems,” “industrial Internet,” and the “Internet of Things (IOT )” to refer to what we are calling “intelligent systems.” While these terms do not necessarily mean the same thing, they all bring to mind a common set of enabling technologies that are making physical systems intelligent.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain an- the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},

abstract={The current development of computational intelligence reminds the author of late 1980s and early 1990s when there were tremendous excitements and opportunities for computational intelligence research and applications. We are entering the second golden period for computational intelligence development, because effective and efficient solutions to many of today's grand challenges in e-healthcare, smart cities, internet-of-things, Big Data, etc., require better, faster and cheaper computational intelligence algorithms, methods and techniques. These new challenges pose new research questions that can stimulate the rapid growth of our research field. There are huge opportunities for all of us to contribute to developing novel computational intelligence solutions to these challenges. Why not share your ideas and experiences in tackling difficult real-world problems with the wider communities and submit your work to one of the CIS journals? Authors who had a paper recently presented at WCCI'14 might be interested in taking the feedback they got at the Congress, extending the work further and submitting an extended paper to a CIS journal. They are here encouraged to let the world know of any novel ideas and contributions.},

abstract={The Internet has experienced a tremendous growth in the past three decades, evolving from a network of a few hundred hosts to a platform linking billions of "things" globally, including individual people as well as enterprises of various sizes, through computers and computerized devices of any conceivable size and capability and the applications running on them. The growth of the Internet shows no signs of slowing down and it steadily becomes the cause of a new pervasive paradigm in computing and communications. This new paradigm enhances the traditional Internet into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) created around intelligent interconnections of diverse objects in the physical world, such as vehicles, cell phones, habitats, and habitat occupants. It utilizes low-cost information gathering and dissemination devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, that facilitate fast-paced interactions among the objects themselves as well as the objects and persons in any place and at any time. IoT will usher in a wide range of smart applications and services to cope with many of the challenges individuals and organizations face in their everyday lives. For example, remote healthcare monitoring systems could aid in managing costs and alleviating the shortage of healthcare personnel; intelligent transportation systems could aid in reducing traffic congestion and inevitably the ills caused by it such as air pollution; smart distribution systems from utility grids to supply chains could aid in improving the quality and reducing the cost of their respective goods and services; tagged objects could result in more systematic recycling and effective waste disposal, and so on.},

pages={8407-8417},
abstract={This paper describes a mixed-signal electrocardiogram (ECG) system for personalized and remote cardiac health monitoring. The novelty of this paper is fourfold. First, a low power analog front end with an efficient automatic gain control mechanism, maintaining the input of the ADC to a level rendering optimum SNR and the enhanced recyclic folded cascode opamp used as an integrator for ΣΔ ADC. Second, a novel on-the-fly PQRST boundary detection (BD) methodology is formulated for finding the boundaries in continuous ECG signal. Third, a novel low-complexity ECG feature extraction architecture is designed by reusing the same module present in the proposed BD methodology. Fourth, the system is having the capability to reconfigure the proposed low power ADC for low (8 b) and high (12 b) resolution with the use of the feedback signal obtained from the digital block when it is in processing. The proposed system has been tested and validated on patient's data from PTBDB, CSEDB, and in-house IIT Hyderabad Data Base (IITHDB) and we have achieved an accuracy of 99% upon testing on various normal and abnormal ECG signals. The whole system is implemented in 180-nm technology resulting in 9.47-μW (at 1 MHz) power consumption and occupying 1.74-mm2 silicon area.},

abstract={In this brief, we propose a low-complexity architectural implementation of the K-means-based clustering algorithm used widely in mobile health monitoring applications for unsupervised and supervised learning. The iterative nature of the algorithm computing the distance of each data point from a respective centroid for a successful cluster formation until convergence presents a significant challenge to map it onto a low-power architecture. This has been addressed by the use of a 2-D Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer-based low-complexity engine for computing the n-dimensional Euclidean distance involved during clustering. The proposed clustering engine was synthesized using the TSMC 130-nm technology library, and a place and route was performed following which the core area and power were estimated as 0.36 mm2 and 9.21 mW at 100 MHz, respectively, making the design applicable for low-power real-time operations within a sensor node.},

abstract={Mobile health (m-Health) is one potential application of cyber-physical systems, where biomedical sensors and mobile devices interact tightly together to transmit medical data to an m-Health server. In this paper, we consider a three-tier hierarchical m-Health system: 1) the sensor network tier capturing vital signals; 2) the mobile computing network tier processing and routing the sensed data to a fixed remote location; and 3) the back-end network tier processing and analyzing the sensed medical data along with patient’s medical history. Based on this architecture, a physical layer security scheme for the second tier is developed and network performance of the introduced scheme is analyzed under different metrics using stochastic geometry. To be specific, secure transmission range and average end-to-end delay are analyzed for two different strategies: the mobile device transmits: 1) to the nearest neighbor and 2) to the furthest neighbor. Furthermore, we consider the cases of full knowledge on eavesdroppers’ locations and when such information is unavailable. Results show that transmitting to the nearest neighbor achieves the highest secure transmission distance with the lowest mean delay when full information on eavesdroppers is available.},

abstract={Nowadays state of the art health care systems are either based on hospital or household environs and its scope is confined to urban areas of a country. Yet traditional healthcare systems are facing challenges such as lack of ubiquity, use of backdated techniques, inadequacies in tracking, observing and reporting status of patients and diseases as well as unaffordability. However, modern updates in IoT, cloud computing, mobile and web development and computer vision technology are offering us a wider scope in providing an effective health care system to everyone. The assistance includes automation in systematic monitoring of patients, transmission of medical data at real-time, saving those data in cloud servers, manipulate data for future use, presenting real time scenario to stake holders and many more. Here we suggest a wireless network infrastructure that will provide useful health and medical services to children and adults as well as assist in distributing vaccines, tablets and personnel to monitor endemic diseases. We have two components in our system, first one is the clinic booth accompanied by health workers. This system assists health workers in their work and acquire personalized data and sends them to an online server for future use. Second is the administration and presentation of the ground data to stake holders. In our preliminary network evaluation of the IoT powered clinic booth design we found average response time of 1.5 seconds with uptime of 98.16%.},

pages={0853-0856},
abstract={Human resource is of great assert, as it is the gift of nature. Exploitation of human resources should strictly be monitored on health aspects. The power generation sectors in view to increase the combustion quality for enhancing the power production contribute to green house gases which is a threat to human health. The prime aspiration is in detection, recognition and understanding of combustion conditions in power plants ensuring low Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions for protecting the human health from hazardous gases. The colour information from the furnace flame images is the foundation for this scheme. The process of estimating the NOx emissions using a feed forward controller is implemented using Back propagation Algorithm (BPA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The challenge lies in identification of the 10 attributes used for training the ANN so as to estimate the NOx emissions. The estimation by ANN is termed as intelligent sensors embedded in the computing system to monitor using (IoT). This method proves to be indispensable because this IoT based online monitoring has reduced the percentage of emissions by 19% thereby increasing the combustion quality which has profound effect on human health.},

This study performed slip tests on 10 healthy male students (age: 20.0±1.6 years, height: 1.72±0.05 m, mass: 64.67±9.81 kg) using the test system, Kinematics and kinetic date analyses using the Ariel video analysis system and Kistler force platform were performed. When the subject encountering an unexpected backward slip during sit-to-stand, people will take a backward recovery step and increase the maximum rising velocity of the hip joint by strong support against a backward slip. After balance perturbation training, similar to balance perturbation intensity, the amplitude of the balance adjustment decreased significantly. People can maintain their balance by swinging their trunk and arm.},

year={2016},

pages={287-293},
abstract={It is time for clinician to be more elegant in diagnosis, and at the same time the patient to be taken care of in an all-round way. The improving and opening of the health and medical data, as well as the wide use of the environment and the human body sensors, gives us the opportunity to do so. This paper proposes an "observant clinician and touchable patient" integrated architecture (OCTOPIA), which is for both clinician and patient and extendible. On the basis of integrated medical knowledge, human health and environmental data, OCTOPIA interacts with the patient in a heuristic way to analyze the patient's symptoms and likely diseases. Then, comprehensive data information will be presented to the clinician. In all key links, clinicians will have the opportunity to use their own experience to influence the final diagnosis. Broadly, OCTOPIA consists of five major components: data capture, symptom-disease graph, QA system, ranking likely diseases and visualization. This paper proposes an architecture integrating the environment and human body information, and presents the solutions of an interactive QA system for symptom, a multi-factor calculation model for disease and a visualization design. With the help of OCTOPIA, the patient's information and the state of the environment are more fully perceived, while clinician can make a more detailed diagnosis.},

abstract={Indoor positioning systems are becoming a required sub-system in many ambient assisted living scenarios. Another area that would greatly benefit from the enriched context of localization is the IoT (Internet of Things) device interaction. However, at this moment there aren't any satisfying technologies or approaches for precise indoor positioning. This paper proposes an indoor positioning method based on trilateration using Wi-Fi RSSI measurements with corrections to eliminate the noise and the bias. The proposed method is tested in a laboratory environment and results are described.},

abstract={Health is closely related to everyone. Integrating different medical data sets will bring tremendous value for human. Basing on Chinese and English disease medical term, we use text mining technique in terms of two dimensions of the disease from the name and text description of the semantic clustering to achieve initial alignment disease terminology. First, we translate the Chinese data set through the API translation. Then we assign weights for each feature item to obtain feature vector for each disease node disease. Finally, we calculate the similarity of diseases and K-means clustering. We conduct experiments to evaluate the method on real-world and authoritative dataset, and the results prove that it has better rationality and superiority. The method can be extended to the initial alignment of multilingual texts with the same concept after improving.},

abstract={In the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) wrist pulse diagnosis plays a major role in detecting the health status of an individual. It depends strongly on the doctors' long-term experience as well as on their different inferences. Being subjective and based on long-term experience, pulse detection methods are difficult to standardize. Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD), established by Wei Jin, is an efficient method validated by both traditional Chinese medicine and in recent years also by western medicine. The key step to automatic implementation of KPD, using signal processing and analysis, is the developed KPD signal acquisition device. However, the raw wrist pulse signal acquired from KPD device includes a significant amount of noise. This paper proposes several preprocessing algorithms for pulse diagnosis, that includes wavelet transform and Gaussian filter to remove noise and the iterative sliding window (ISW) algorithm to remove the baseline wander and split the continuous signal into single periods. Experimental results show, that the algorithm for baseline wander removal is efficient and that the segmented signal matches the signal described in KPD.},

abstract={The network mobility (NEMO) management for a mobile network of IPv6 low-power personal area network (6LoWPAN) in smart buildings has attracted much interest recently, this is partly due to the emergence of the internet of things (IoT). For the specific case of hospital environments, NEMO provides continued connectivity with the Internet for patients attached with 6LoWPAN mobile nodes (MNs) regardless of patients' locations. NEMO comprises a set of mobile network nodes (MNNs) that could move together as a single unit, and each of these mobile networks has a mobile router (MR) that can change its attachment point to the Internet as the network moves together. Even though NEMO has a low signaling cost, but there is a need to understand their challenges for a 6LoWPAN mobile network in smart buildings. If the MR loses its energy, the connectivity with the network will be lost. In this paper, to illustrate the challenges of NEMO in smart buildings like hospital environments, the traffic load at MR will be evaluated against the number of MNNs, number of handovers, and data arrival rate. This has been simulated by OMNet++4.3.1 and Contiki.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has empowered several sets of applications related to remote monitoring for patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases, where, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring has been widely studied and applied. Furthermore, in order to optimize the energy consumption in these monitoring systems, compression techniques have been widely deployed. Compressive sensing (CS) has gained a lot of attention in ECG monitoring as a result of its ability to leverage the ECG signal structure in order to achieve a high efficient acquisition scheme. The paper investigates the incorporation of CS in IoT-based ECG monitoring platforms. The platform consists of a CS-based compression and recovery, in addition, the platform provides an abnormality detection for each heart beat using different pattern recognition algorithms. The obtained results reveal that transmitting only 15 % of the samples is enough to recover the signal efficiently. Moreover, using up to 20% of the total sample can achieve a high classification accuracy as using the original data with a maximum drop down of 3.3 % in the worst case scenario.},

year={2017},
volume={},

pages={871-876},
abstract={Lifelogging physical activity (PA) assessment is crucial to healthcare technologies and studies for the purpose of treatments and interventions of chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies. Whilst PA activity monitoring by mobile phone is still a challenging issue by far due to much more uncertainties than wearable devices.},

Our unique contribution consists of leveraging the advanced functionalities of OpenStack to introduce a master node specifically designed for IoT/M2M scalability in the cloud and a load balancing queue node cooperating with the master node for fair distribution of incoming traffic among platform nodes. Using four different types of IoT/M2M applications: smart meter, Bluetooth tags, eHealth, and video, we show that compared to LBAAS and Heat that are OpenStack native load balancing and scalability functions, in most cases our proposed system is capable of achieving the fastest response time and the lowest computational cost with acceptable tradeoff of more energy consumption.},

pages={851-857},
abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a framework that is mostly used in industrial applications such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing and it is not immune from potential future hacking. By carrying out various types of cyber-attacks, hackers can disrupt the normal operation of a robot. It is easy to get control of communication between a robot and a human due to the open communication network after carrying out malicious attacks to jam the network. As a result, hackers can change commands which are sent by an operator to the robot, making usual activities impossible. For instance, in a case of ROS hacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojans, backdoor attacks, and so on, can change the behaviour of robots to something completely different than expected.Therefore, forensic analysts require a specific method to forensically investigate ROS. This is a new area in the computer forensics field. Therefore, it is proposed to create an analytical framework to facilitate the forensic investigation of the Robot Operating System and methodologies and standards for acquiring related digital evidence using forensic tools. This study addresses a formalized and structured methodology that would assist the forensic investigation approach.This research will help to enhance the gathering, identification and preservation of evidence related to forensics investigations of the Robot Operating System. The forensic analysts could adapt the examination procedure of hacked ROS with a focused, crime-specific, forensics framework.},

title={Available Forward Road Capacity Detection Algorithms to Reduce Urban Traffic Congestion},
year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={110-119},
abstract={Road congestion is a complex, significant and continuing problem and is a major factor in reduced air quality. This project is concerned with urban road systems and traffic signal control. The work presents the algorithms employed by experimental traffic signals used in a simulated road network. The network is a grid system that is specifically contrived to exhibit highly interactive tidal congestion. The available forward road capacity (AFRC) algorithm is presented as an extension of existing MOVA control algorithms. The objective of providing maximum junction utilisation under congested conditions is explained along with the proposed solution. AFRC automatically determines the temporal and geographic boundaries of congestion and attempts to resolve the problem across multiple junctions without the need for prior knowledge of traffic flows. The system is therefore self-organising and, as a result, is able to respond to dynamic and unanticipated flow changes without manual reconfiguration. Simulation results are presented which compare the action of MOVA and AFRC detection in managing high density congestion across the multiple junction network. The results obtained show that delays can be significantly reduced in periods of congestion and that the performance improvement increases as the road becomes more congested. Reducing overall congestion duration generates time savings for individuals and a reduction in the negative effects on the environment and public health, increased fuel efficiency and reduced fuel waste. The main benefits of the system are equally applicable to all powered transport systems regardless of fuel source or control method including autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with V2X communication. The controller is an ongoing development and is capable of directly and accurately measuring the degree of congestion providing metrics that may be used for other controls including gating and active traffic guidance.},

abstract={Designing efficient strategies of reducing health care costs and optimizing facility utilization has long be a pursue of health systems, and stratifying patients into different expenditure/utilization patterns and further profiling these patient groups can provide useful clues for the strategy design. In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases. Overall, this study can usefully promote the development of healthcare-strategy design and implementation.},

abstract={The advances in sensor technology over recent years has provided new ways for researchers to monitor the elderly in uncontrolled environments. Sensors have become smaller, cheaper and can be worn on the body, potentially creating a network of sensors. Smart phones are also more common in the average household and can also provide some behavioural analysis due to the built in sensors. As a result of this, researchers are able to monitor behaviours in a more natural setting, which can lead to more useful data. This is important for those that may be suffering from mental illness as it allows for continuous, non-invasive monitoring in order to diagnose symptoms from different behaviours. However there are various challenges that need to be addressed ranging from issues with sensors to the involvement of human factors. It is vital that these challenges are taken into consideration along with the major behavioural symptoms that can appear in an Elderly Person. For a person suffering with Dementia, the application of sensor technologies can improve the quality of life of the person and also monitor the progress of the disease through behavioural analysis. This paper will consider the behaviours that can be associated with dementia and how these behaviours can be monitored through sensor technology. We will also provide an insight into some sensors and algorithms gathered through survey in order to provide advantages and disadvantages of these technologies as well as to present any challenges that may face future research.},

abstract={With the growth of cities, the waste produced also increases. Many of the world's developing cities are still lacking in the area of waste management, in particular, the collection of garbage within the cities. Because of this, garbage tends to pile up in certain areas. This not only poses a health risk to the surrounding communities, but also creates unpleasant environments for the residents. To provide a solution to this problem, a smart garbage monitoring system is therefore proposed to tackle the issues faced. This system will allow the city authorities to better manage their resources in the collection of garbage and provide a platform that will allow for an efficient garbage collection system.},

abstract={Mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs) have arisen as a very promising brandnew healthcare system, which will greatly improve the quality of life. Moreover, with the help of Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any Trusted Third Party (TTP). Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching. Finally, we do comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world smartphones to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed schemes.},

abstract={The relationship between nurse and patient is vital as well as vulnerable on which a significant portion of well-being of patient depends. The recent growth of Internet of Things provides the opportunity to maintain this relationship in a more secure and efficient way. From this point of view, this paper presents a system of real-time nurse calling with focus centered on nurse feedback based on patient condition. The system also includes a robust archive monitoring system for review and trend analysis. In the proposed system, patients are able to call for assistance in time of emergency by pressing a designated button. After this, the device will send a real-time message containing information about the patients bed, room, and floor number to the appropriate nurse station. Nurse will respond as soon as the message is delivered, and optionally call for help by pressing designated buttons in the device. The proposed system reduces the delay in response of nurse. Additionally, the interactions are stored in Raspberry Pi database for future analysis to improve the quality of services. The proposed system uses low-cost hardware like ATMEGA328P microcontroller and ENC28J60 Ethernet controller, and Arduino Uno.},

The main obstacles are considered to be i) specific IoT solutions often tend to be a small part of the overall solution, ii) lack of knowledge about which overall services the IoT solution may be part of, iii) Fragmentation and insufficient scalability, iv) Distrust and hesitation among actors to share data and platforms and finally, v) fear of changing the own business model. The analysis of our cases indicates that most of the challenges occur due to the fact that the solutions initially have been developed using a single firm business model. In order to survive or grow a networked business model is needed.},

abstract={Healthcare industry has proven its technically abundant applications at par other industries with the help of many concepts like IoT and cloud computing. It has transformed its techniques by using intelligent gadgets that can be acquainted with patients in different configurations. The data obtained from devices like pulse rate monitors, weighing scales, blood glucose measuring devices, etc. is to be stocked and tracked as awareness of health statistics is vital for all. A hefty portion of these measures requires a follow-off with a specialist. This commences the preference of using IoT based smart devices to deliver more valuable data to the patient and drop off the necessity for direct patient-doctor interaction. Improving the standard of service, it brings particularly high value for the patients requiring constant supervision and quick data access and analysis. This paper will demonstrate automatic communication between the smart devices and android mobile application via Bluetooth and data storage on Cloud. Also, it shows automatic control over oxygen cylinder using mobile app for admitted patients who require supplementary oxygen. Thus, our system serves the purpose of minimizing doctors' efforts and providing seamless experience to the patient with IoT, Cloud and Wireless Technology like Bluetooth helping in saving millions of lives.},

The system detects changes in mobility using movement velocity information and the degree of dependence the subject develops in relation to the handrail-IoT sensors. Herein, we describe a field experiment of our handrail sensor system that was installed in the home of an 88-year-old female test subject.

abstract={The last decade has witnessed tremendous efforts to shape the internet of thing (IoT) platforms to be well suited for healthcare applications. These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multi-channel EEG signals as well as a designed sparsifying basis to increase the sparsity of the EEG signal to improve the reconstruction quality, hence, increase the efficiency of the system.},

abstract={Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of death and disability with over 3.8 million annual cases and 130 daily deaths in the United States alone. Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.},

There are a number of current solutions related to fall detection; however, remain low detection accuracy.

abstract={The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.},

abstract={The combined use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices is an emerging topic of the environmental monitoring, which combines the versatility of multi-copter airframes with the potentiality of low-cost wireless sensors. This paper introduces some performance metrics suitable to quantify the capability of an RFIDrone to scan a surface equipped with radio-sensors. By using simple propagation models, an optimal drone-surface distance is mathematically derived at the purpose to maximize the electromagnetic footprint for the specific choice of system parameters, such as the sensor type and position, the reader sensitivity, the ground reflectivity, the radiated power, and the flight velocity. Theoretical achievements and some preliminary experimentations indicate that omnidirectional antennas are preferred for the drone so that 9-12 m footprints could be achieved with state-of-the-art readers and battery-less or battery-assisted RFID sensors, provided that the UAV flights at 3-5 m from the surface to be monitored. In this condition, the hit-rate of arrays of tags is better than 90% for a flying speed less than 1.8 km/h. The read performance is instead sensibly degraded by the presence of multi path in case of sensors spaced out the surface.},

abstract={With the development of medical sensors and IoT, personalized service assisted elder and patient living is a critical service in IoT-based healthcare application. However, the scale and complexity of personalized service is increasing because of ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of medical sensors, which cause response time increase and resource waste. Therefore, leveraging the advantage of complex event processing (CEP) in data stream processing, we propose a hierarchical fog-cloud computing CEP architecture for personalized service to accelerate response time and reduce resource waste. Firstly, we introduce the proposed architecture, which includes sensor layer, fog layer and cloud layer. Secondly, we propose a series of optimizations for the architecture, there are a partitioning and clustering approach and a communication and parallel processing policy to optimize the fog and cloud computing. Finally, we implement a prototype system based on the architecture named FogCepCare. Experimental result shows that FogCepCare is superior to the traditional IoT-based healthcare application.},

abstract={Heavy vehicle traffic and flooded areas are problems experienced on roads because of unimproved road infrastructures and environmental deviations. These factors affect vehicle drivers negatively as they contribute to stress, health problems, and wastefulness of time. This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets. A Bayesian Network is generated from the water level sensors and image processing data which provides possible reroute areas to avoid traffic congestion and flooded areas. All data are sent to a cloud platform through the Internet that can be accessed through a mobile user interface. This mobile user application provides information about the condition of the streets and possible reroute maps to users. The accuracy of the system is tested by actual implementation on a specific road. Results showed minimum accessing delay from using the ArRoad to navigate in rerouted paths to prevent impassable roads due to heavy traffic and flood. If effect, it lessens the amount of time experienced by drivers from heavy traffic condition and flooded streets which then improves the quality of life by preventing waste of resources such as time and money.},

To accomplish that, the deployment of nanodevices very near to organs should be a must. However, the idea to deploy nanodevices should be sustained in basis of basic processes, as the ones of physics for instance. In this paper, a physics model based on electrodynamics describing all those processes of anomalous fluxing of albumin in the very beginning of the diabetes kidney disease (DKD), and tested with the assistance of the Monte Carlo method is presented.

pages={1-1},
abstract={Location service is fundamental to many IoT applications such as smart home, wearables, smart city, and connected health. With existing infrastructures, wireless positioning is widely used to provide the location service. However, wireless positioning has the limitations such as highly depending on the distribution of access points (APs); providing a low samplerate and noisy solution; requiring extensive labor costs to build databases; and having unstable RSS values in indoor environments. To reduce these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative integrated platform for indoor localization by integrating low-cost MEMS sensors and wireless signals. This proposed platform consists of wireless AP localization engine and sensor fusion engine, which is suitable for both dense and sparse deployments of wireless APs. The proposed platform can automatically generate wireless databases for positioning, and provide a positioning solution even in the area with only one observed wireless AP, where the traditional trilateration method cannot work. This integration platform can integrate different kinds of wireless APs together for indoor localization (e.g., WiFi, BLE, and RFID). The platform fuses all of these wireless distances with low-cost MEMS sensors to provide a robust localization solution. A multi-level quality control mechanism is utilized to remove noisy RSS measurements from wireless APs and to further improve the localization accuracy. Preliminary experiments show the proposed integration platform can achieve the average accuracy of 3.30 m with the sparse deployment of wireless APs (1 AP per 800 m²).},

Usually, rail tracks are inspected only at midnight and also the inspection is carried out only once in a month or lesser. Unfortunately, any emergency issues not detected within the stipulated time leads to train derailment and other safety concerns. Hence in-service vehicle has been introduced to increase the safety of train transportation. In this paper, track irregularities are detected using bogie and car body acceleration measurements and these measurements is further optimized using particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The proposed system is compared with the conventional track geometry measurement system. The monitoring and control information can be sent through IoT. Simulation results are performed for two different speed scenarios and it shows that the proposed system produces better results than the traditional track geometry measurement system and the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={In a cyber-physical system (CPS), the events start or finish in a sequence of time. The sequence can be called chronological order. Chronological order relationship is essential in determining system status and providing decision reference in feedback control related to IoT areas. However, the correctness of the order obtained is vulnerable to many factors. This paper delves into typical events in a closed cyber-physical environment and the chronological relationship between them, gives a criteria to tell if their respective sensors can distinguish the chronological order of two events. Besides, a framework to reconstruct the chronological order of inter-dependent, simple events is proposed. Finally, an experiment based on the framework is conducted with the ability to identify the underlying chronological order in a system.},

It comprises of novel, low complex and low power intelligent signal processing architecture for detection of voluntary eye blinks by isolating involuntary eye blinks and IoT enabled wireless actuation network for controlling the environment using commands generated from EEG signal. For the real time performance analysis of the proposed architecture, we developed a wearable device which acquires dual channel EEG using electrodes at Fp1 and Fp2 locations. From the acquired EEG data, the device detects the voluntary eye blinks of the patient and use this information in controlling the environment such as switching HVAC system, lighting or electric fan etc. Performance analysis shows that the proposed intelligent signal processing architecture detects the voluntary eye blinks with 95.2% accuracy when tested on 10 subjects with a low power consumption of 165 mW.},

abstract={E-health is one of the domains which will need more and more IoT solutions in the future, as it requires short delays for life-dependency situations and safe local storage spaces for privacy matters. The emergency context demands efficient communication and computing capacities, and the cloud vision as well as traditional TCP/IP way of communication cannot really suit these requirements. New approaches are currently used : the fog computing paradigm, which describe the IoT environment in a more relevant way than the cloud vision, provides new performances as low latency, local storage opportunities, end-to-user services. E-health fogs have attracted a lot of attentions. To realize the efficient communication, E-Health systems also introduce Content-Centric Network (CCN) approach, whose characteristics include quick response, content distribution, IoT oriented technology. Nowadays, the existing E-health fog or CCN are seen as separate and autonomous networks, but many applications could require that those E-health fog computing systems exchange data, share processing results, or subscribe to each other information flux. In this paper we propose a solution for E-health systems to communicate by combining fog computing and CCN to provide communication efficiency and local storage opportunities. Finally we use simulation to evaluate the delay performances of our proposal.},

abstract={This talk will focus on an IoT Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) presented as an example of IoT work in the UAE and as part of the UAE SRC (Semiconductor Research Corp) Center of Excellence on Energy Efficient Electronic Systems (aka ACE4S http://www.src.org/program/grc/ace4s/) involving researchers from 5 UAE Universities looking at developing new technologies aiming at innovative self-powered wireless sensing and monitoring SoC platforms. The research targets applications in self-powered chip sets for use in public health, ambient intelligence, safety and security and IoT. ACE4S is the first SRC center of excellence outside the US. One such application, which we will discuss in details, is a ground breaking self-powered IoT SoC platform for wearable health care. More specifically we will present a novel fully integrated ECG signal processing system for the prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using a unique set of ECG features extracted from two consecutive cardiac cycles. Two databases of the heart signal recordings from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the MIT PhysioNet were used as training, test and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The system achieved an accuracy of 99%. The ECG signal is sensed using a flexible, dry, Graphene-based technology and the system is powered up by harvesting human thermal energy. The system architecture is implemented in Global foundries' 65 nm CMOS process, occupies 0.112 mm2 and consumes 2.78 micro Watt at an operating frequency of10 KHz and from a supply voltage of 1.2V. To our knowledge, this is the first SoC implementation of an ECG-based processor that is capable of predicting ventricular arrhythmia hours before the onset and with an accuracy of 99%.},

abstract={With the need for increased care and welfare of the rapidly aging population, mobile telemedicine is becoming popular for providing remote health care to increase the quality of life. Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the “edge”, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920×1080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3×3 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and prototype of a wireless health monitoring system using mobile phone accessories. We focus on measuring real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitoring using a smartphone case. With the increasing number of cardiac patients worldwide, this design can be used for early detection of heart diseases. Unlike most of the existing methods that use an optical sensor to monitor heart rate, our approach is to measure real-time ECG with dry electrodes placed on smartphone case. The collected ECG signal can be stored and analyzed in real time through a smartphone application for prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed hardware system consists of a single chip microcontroller (RFduino) embedded with Bluetooth low energy, hence miniaturizing the size and prolonging battery life. The system called “smart case” has been tested in a laboratory environment. We also designed a 3-D printed smartphone case to validate the feasibly of the system. The results demonstrated that the proposed system could be comparable to medical grade devices.},

abstract={Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) is a practical cryptographic primitive for enforcing fine-grained attribute-based access control of personal health information (PHI) in mobile healthcare (mHealth) cloud. Existing schemes are either limited to restricted attribute universe or lack of efficient decryption algorithm for users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme for PHI in mHealth cloud. The proposed scheme simultaneously supports unbounded attribute universe and offers efficient decryption outsourcing approach without leaking the PHI privacy. It enables the PHI owner to define access policy in the form of any monotonic access structures. We prove the security in the standard model. Compared with relevant schemes, our scheme can reduce the user's decryption cost from increasing linearly with the number of attributes to constant.},

abstract={The heightened utilization of ionizing radiation for diagnostic and beneficial purposes, the expeditious progress in nuclear reactors, as well as the risks of radioactive waste have raised significant safety and health concerns for the people working with radiation and the general public. While some exposure to radiation is acceptable, radiation monitoring should be done to keep the levels of radiation exposure to a minimum. In this paper, we intend to monitor and measure the radiation levels that a specific area is exposed to using a radiation sensor, and to send the data to a cloud from where the values can be accessed by the concerned authorities. In order to meet the objectives we utilize GM counters, which are radiation sensors that detect and measure the amount of radiation present in the radiation environment. The GM counter is interfaced to a NodeMCU to update the detected and measured radiation to a radiation IoT platform that can store and retrieve data across a network. Further, a GPS module is interfaced with the NodeMCU to locate the location data of the radiation emitted from the radiation sources under such radiation environment. The radiation values are remotely monitored in real time through web server configured with the radiation IoT platform to remote monitor the radiation level and mapping the location of such radiations.},

As part of which we are adopting the use of wireless sensors that will keep the child to get monitored. Our system enables the child to get involved with some android games which will make him/her to think and act dynamically. The game scores and the sensor readings obtained from the child will be monitored and analyzed by the system and actions will be taken accordingly. Since the data generated by the system are humongous, we adopt Hadoop in the background to effectively map the data and to reduce it into elementary. As this data need confidentiality in transmission, Apache Ranger is being used for the secure transmission and for the classification of the child behavior, C4.5 decision algorithm is used in the system. While testing with the medical dataset, C4.5 proved to be more accurate than ID3 algorithm.},

abstract={Most current studies of epileptic seizure detection disclose that "Despite the design of new anti-epileptic drugs, drug resistant epilepsy still lacks an ultimate solution" [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'. This way a personalised monitoring plan (PMP) for each individual epilepsy patient can be realised.},

pages={1850-1855},
abstract={In this paper, we propose to determine whether the viewer's behavior changes or not before, during and after watching a TV program. Are there any behaviors specific to each particular phase of viewing? Here, we propose a flexible and nonintrusive method based on the use of three categories of everyday connected objects (i.e. Smartphone, smartwatch and remote control). Data were collected during participants' interactions with a smart TV i.e. during three phases of viewing a TV program: before, during and after in an uncontrolled environment. A classification of these behaviors was done in order to identify the behaviors of viewers during each phase of TV-watching using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm, without prior pre-processing of the learning data. The results show that the viewers' behavior is very different from each other during the three phases. Thus, the behavior that was detected in two different phases did not have the same frequency of occurrence for all participants and was not performed by a given viewer with the same duration. In addition, the DNN algorithm gives a good average recognition performance of the three phases: 92.75%, 87.5% and 94% for the first second and third phase respectively. This study can help to better understand the viewers' behavior and anticipate certain actions in order to maintain their attention towards the proposed TV programs.},

abstract={In accordance with the resent advancement in Internet of Things (IoT), the needs for IoT experiment platform have been ever increasing. IoT system consists of various technologies such as networking, sensor controller, edge-side computing, server-side big data collections, analysis and their visualizations. An experimental environment that can handle the development and experiments of such an IoT system become important. In the IoT system, a highly flexible system structure for applications using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is required. The authors propose the Remote Laboratory System for handling IoT experiments in the Cyber Laboratory, which is an educational FPGA-based remote laboratory for under-graduate university students. It enables not only to use available board-level small computers but also to use FPGA boards for prototyping IoT edges. It can also organize the IoT cloud-server side programs in the hybrid cloud. The FPGA based edge-side computing approach can have much more freedom and flexibility to implement various sensor controls those can be customized for specific IoT applications. The use of free micro-processor IP-core and re-organizing the available FPGA CAD design platform allow us to reduce the burden of design and implementation efforts for the construction of new Cyber Laboratory to accommodate IoT designs and experiments. It also contributed to reduce the students' amount of efforts to conduct their own IoT design and experiments, where students are required to have various skills in Information Technologies (IT): hardware design, edge-side computing, server-side computing, networking and infrastructure construction. The use of the Docker container/Swarm and the Docker File contributed to construct their own IoT experiment platforms for every student automatically, in the form of "Infrastructure as Code". Furthermore, these separately designed IoT experiment platforms can be combined to conduct a group of group experiment simultane- usly.

abstract={A brain-computer interface (BCI) for seizure prediction provides a means of controlling epilepsy in medically refractory patients whose site of epileptogenicity cannot be resected but yet can be defined sufficiently to be selectively influenced by strategically implanted electrodes. Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.},

Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all. This paper is a review of Healthcare Monitoring system using IoT.},

abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work develops the Alzimio mobile app, to provide safety functions to these patients; including safe-zone geofencing, activity-based alarms, take-me-home, navigate to nearest friend, and check-on-me. Six main design goals guided the design of Alzimio, including periodic safety checks, refined user control, flexibility and efficiency of alarms, and optimized operation, among others. Providing reliable continuous sensing and operation without drastically affecting battery lifetime provided a challenge. Such challenge is not unique to Alzimio, but is general to most IoT healthcare devices. Novel activity-recognition and geofencing algorithms are designed and optimized to meet the goals and overcome the challenge. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. Alzimio is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The phone was able to last throughout the day in our tests, which is very promising.},

abstract={United nation population report predicts that the world population will hit 8 billion by 2026 with hopping 1.5 billion in India. This increased population demands improved medical facilities only to realize there are not adequate doctors on role leading to deaths of nearly 1M Indians every year & approximately 700M deprived of even preliminary health treatment thereby carrying 21% of the global disease burden. In general, doctors are either not willing to serve the rural areas or they are not available 24×7 that is causing rural population to travel to cities even for casual ailments. According to WHO (World Health Organization) reports, India have less than 0.7 doctor /1000 population which is lower as compared to ratio of 4.3 in Russian federation, 3.8 in Argentina, 2.4 in USA & WHO Benchmark. Indian government spends just around 30% of the total budget in healthcare which is a penny in comparison to the USA & the UK. This increased population demands lower operational cost with high accuracy, early detection followed by prevention. In this paper, a futuristic approach is proposed to support the existing healthcare system by designing a preliminary multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair with E-diagnostic feature within a medical booth, analogous to an ATM booth. The attractive part of our system is low priced diagnosis, non-invasiveness, indigenously built medical apparatus, misdiagnosis prevention with fast systematic approach.},

abstract={Campuses and cities of the near future will be equipped with vast numbers of IoT devices. Operators of such environments may not even be fully aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This paper proposes the use of network traffic analytics to characterize IoT devices, including their typical behaviour mode. We first collect and synthesize traffic traces from a smart-campus environment instrumented with a diversity of IoT devices including cameras, lights, appliances, and health-monitors; our traces, collected over a period of 3 weeks, are released as open data to the public. We then analyze the traffic traces to characterize statistical attributes such as data rates and burstiness, activity cycles, and signalling patterns, for over 20 IoT devices deployed in our environment. Finally, using these attributes, we develop a classification method that can not only distinguish IoT from non-IoT traffic, but also identify specific IoT devices with over 95% accuracy. Our study empowers operators of smart cities and campuses to discover and monitor their IoT assets based on their network behaviour.},

abstract={Over the next 20 years there will be demographic shift from predominantly younger populations to older ones. Current models of care and pathways require transforming to become more citizen focused and support greater community resilience and sustainability. This will require different approaches to innovation to improve quality of life for people as they age, reduce onset of frailty as well as support those better with long term conditions around self-management and prevention strategies. Health and social care providers are looking at how they augment traditional clinical health related services with the use of IoT technologies and smart city services. This paper describes the on-going work of the Birmingham City4Age pilot, managed by the local authority, Birmingham City Council and funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission focused on the unobtrusive collection of data via wearable devices, outdoor sensors and other smart city systems that aims to help reduce the onset of frailty of older people. Locality and contextual data is being captured on individuals' behaviours with increased frequency that aims to help in detecting early changes in daily living - physical activity and social patterns and develop technology based interventions to help reduce the risk of frailty. The proposed systems architecture is being validated in two distinct neighbourhoods with contrasting demographics in Birmingham, UK adopting an iterative user design approach designed to support independence.},

In this paper, we present a secure way to control the flow of personal data in the specific case of the recruitment of participants for clinical trials. We take special care to protect the interests of both parties: the individual can keep its data private until an agreement is reached, and the Clinical Research Institute can be assured that it is acquiring useful and authentic data.

Serious consequences of sustaining a fall include broken or fractured bones, superficial cuts and abrasions as well as soft tissue damage. Several solutions are proposed to resolve such problems, however, major difficulties they encounter are cost, comfort and performance. In this paper, we propose a new Android application for fall detection based on theory of machine learning and data mining. Concretely, we used a classification method to detect if it is a fall down or another common events (e.g. sitting, jumping, etc.). The obtained experimental results show that our proposal yielded impressive results compared to related works.},

abstract={Once the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is already running, one important aspect that must be established is the estimation of parameters of the quality of service (QoS). From the view of the end-user, QoS should be high enough in order to guarantee an excellent applicability of the IoBNT, in particular when humans are part of the network and where efficient techniques of nanomedicine are foresen. In this paper, we present a scheme where the QoS is calculated when the IoBNT is applied for sensing abnormalities in kidney. For this end the following key points are considered: (i) sensing of charged proteins through THz waves, (ii) reception by bio-cyber device and subsequent emission of MHz waves, (iii) reception by smartphone, (iv) reception and storing of information at the cloud, (v) exchanging information with server and world-wide-web, and (vi) final reception and treatment of data by the enduser. The estimation of the full QoS has paid attention to the atomic absorption of THz waves by water in human tissue, fact which might degrade the optimal surveillance of the sensing of proteins and which is translated as the main source of errors. The full nonlinear expression is numerically evaluated by obtaining in average a QoS of order of 90±8%.},

abstract={there is currently a significant amount of technology in hospitals in particular in the Intensive Care Units (ICU).

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence. This paper presents the results of applying models to real clinical data. Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14). These models, classification models, should act in a DSS capable of helping to reduce this type of infections as well as reduce the costs associated with them.},

abstract={This research presents two approaches using microwave signals to detect vital signs of humans equipped with an m-health application. The first approach utilizes phase locked loop (PLL) to multiply the frequency of a very accurate Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS), generating a FMCW signal. The second approach multiplies the generated DDS signal using a frequency multiplier (F12). Counter-intuitive existence of low power harmonics (F13, F14, F11, F10, etc.) in the frequency multiplier added improvements in our tests. Tiny variations in environment are easily observed on specific bars in FFT of down-converted signals in the frequency multiplier approach. Both approaches work by sending a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) that reflects off objects present in the room. Based on the reflected signal, we calculate distances and movements, from which we then extract breathing and heart rates. In both approaches, we try two sets of microwave signals: Triangular FMCW and Sawtooth FMCW. Both approaches showed more obvious variation for body movement. In the case of the Triangular FMCW signal, interpreting data is more challenging. On the other hand, the Sawtooth FMCW signal resulted in clear output but lower power and harder to directly observe.},

abstract={The use of animals, specially ovines, for controlling infesting species in crops is an ancient method that has several advantages with respect to the use of chemical and/or mechanical techniques. Shepherds required to supervise animals, are getting increasingly less available and are costly. Over the last years, technologies for automatic animal supervision have been investigated, typically including devices to carry out localization, apply stimulus to the animals and, in some cases, report health data. Ovines have a relatively small size, which constrains the maximum weight that they can carry on, and consequently, imply that a practical system must be highly energy-efficient, to allow building light and small devices with enough autonomy. This paper presents a new system for sheep grazing control, developed in the scope of the SheepIT project. The focus of the paper is on the global communication architecture, which is a fundamental aspect for the overall system efficiency. The paper also includes simulation and experimental results that address the scalability and energy consumption aspects of the system.},

abstract={System-of-Systems (SoS) with real-time communication networks are gaining more importance for many safety relevant application areas such as automotive, medical monitoring and telemedicine in health-care systems. This paper introduces a simulation framework capable of generating and simulating application scenarios of both time-triggered and rate constrained messages with their respective communication schedules with real-time requirements. The scenarios are generated where applications are introduced over time in the SoS. After that, the inputs are processed over time with an incremental scheduler that produces a trace of schedules to be simulated using OPNET. The incremental scheduling problem for the constituent systems is formulated as an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem using IBM CPLEX. In addition, the simulation framework provides verification functions in terms of the evaluation of schedulability and run-time, estimation of worst-case latency for time-triggered and rate-constrained messages.},

abstract={The emergence of IoT devices is revolutionizing various aspects of human life, including healthcare, where the use of such devices can potentially improve health outcomes for millions. However, the efficacy of treatments and protocols based on IoT devices is measured through the use of rigorous double-blind studies, which can be quite expensive to conduct as they traditionally require a third party mediator. In this paper, we propose CATnIP, a secure, centralized cloud hub for instrumenting and conducting double-blind studies, with an extended focus on seamless integration with IoT devices. This paper outlines the construction and security considerations of CATnIP, the motivations behind creating such a system, and an evaluation based on the Five Safes and Stakeholder frameworks.},

The research proceeded with the use of IoT technology, the e-Health Sensor Platform, a differentiated real environment. The experiment used the sensors: pulse and oxygen in blood, body temperature, blood pressure, patients position and falls.

pages={10336-10345},
abstract={Sharing spectrum resources in unlicensed bands grants vehicular applications inexpensive and ubiquitous access to wireless services. However, wireless technology coexistence concerns are gaining increased attention. In response, coexistence test methods are now being reported in the literature, and novel solutions are considered in the American National Standards Institute C63.27 Standard for Evaluation of Wireless Coexistence. Furthermore, the IEEE 802 standards committee formed a new study group, named wireless automotive coexistence, operating under the umbrella of 802.19 working group to highlight the increasing concerns of wireless coexistence in the automotive domain. The radiated open environment coexistence test (ROECT) method offers high flexibility to test wireless devices for coexistence. Radio signal propagation during testing is over the air, reducing access to the signal path. Consequently, monitoring instantaneous device performance is a challenge yet to be addressed. This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the channel utilization of multiple, concurrent wireless transmitters sharing the 2.4-GHz ISM band in the context of ROECT. Passively received power measurements were collected during testing, and then a Gaussian mixture model was used to build a classifier for labeling observed power samples relative to their source. Case studies utilizing IEEE 802.11n as an interfering system with an under test system based on either IEEE 802.11n or ZigBee are detailed. Findings demonstrate the mutual effect of spectrum sharing on both interfering and under test systems in terms of per-second channel utilization and frame collision. Experimental results show an overall accuracy exceeding 98%.},

abstract={This letter proposes a novel privacy-aware “blind” cloud infrastructure to be utilized for storage, processing, and organization of health data. Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},

abstract={One of the challenges of Fifth Generation (5G) networks is how to support massive number of wireless devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT will interconnect billions of devices under machine-to-machine communication links (M2M). However, this massive connectivity will create burden on the cellular network. Fixed sensors and wearable devices are expected to make the majority of future IoT traffic. And scheduling their huge traffic is the scope of this work. Sensors mobility has been considered with three speed, namely zero speed sensors (fixed), and medium and high speed of 30 and 100kmph, to simulate sensors in vehicles, and model the impact of vehicle mobility on the M2M links. This work defines the dimensionality in terms of the number of M2M devices that can be successfully connected, the required bandwidth, sensors mobility, and the transmission mode used. The mutual use of multi antennas, dense deployment of small cells, and the adoption of millimetre wave band, particularly in the 28GHz have been considered as the key enabling technologies to address the massive traffic generated by IoT. An algorithm has been set to schedule this type of traffic and to show whether the M2M devices completed their traffic upload or failed to reach the margin.},

abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multi-organ failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user’s infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user’s mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

abstract={The ability to automatically recognize a person's behavioral context can contribute to health monitoring, aging care, and many other domains. Validating context recognition in the wild is crucial to promote practical applications that work in real-life settings. The authors collected more than 300,000 minutes of sensor data with context labels from 60 subjects. Unlike previous studies, these subjects used their own personal phone, in any way that was convenient to them, and engaged in their routine in their natural environments. Unscripted behavior and unconstrained phone usage resulted in situations that were harder to recognize. The authors demonstrate how fusion of multimodal sensors is important for resolving such cases. They present a baseline system and encourage researchers to use their public dataset to compare methods and improve context recognition in the wild.},

abstract={The success of providing smart healthcare services in ambient assisted living (AAL) largely depends on an effective prediction of situations in the environment. Situation awareness in AAL is to determine the environment smartness by perceiving information related to the surroundings and human behavioral changes. In AAL environment, there are plenty of ways to collect data about its inhabitants, such as through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The collected data are complicated enough to go for an efficient processing in perceiving the situation. This paper gives an overview of the existing research results in multimodal data analysis in AAL environment to improve the living environment of the seniors, and it attempts to bring efficiency in complex event processing for real-time situational awareness. This paper thus considers multimodal sensing for detection of current situations as well as to predict future situations using decision-tree and association analysis algorithms. To illustrate the proposed approach, we consider elderly activity recognition in the AAL environment.},

title={ADF: an Anomaly Detection Framework for Large-scale PM2.5 Sensing Systems},
year={2017},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={As the population density continues to grow in the urban settings, air quality is degrading and becoming a serious issue. Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an Anomaly Detection Framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is comprised of four modules: 1) Time-Sliced Anomaly Detection (TSAD), which detects Spatial, Temporal, and Spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) Real-time Emission Detection (RED), which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) Device Ranking (DR), which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) Malfunction Detection (MD), which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.},

abstract={Emergency medical services are largely to provide facility to people in need of medical treatment or to take patient to the point of definitive care. In developing countries such as Pakistan, emergency medical services, especially pre-hospital emergency case services, are neglected for quite a long time. In metropolitan cities, timely access to emergency care becomes challenging with the increasing number of population. The objective of this research is to propose an end-to-end communication solution in the form of an integrated platform consisting of applications that could facilitate patients and Rescue Service Providers in critical situations efficiently and effectively. An experimental research approach was adopted to develop integrated emergency response platform. A combination of mobile and web technologies was employed to develop proposed platform. Such platforms are helpful to decrease response time and assist rescue service providers by providing associated information such as shortest route to location of incident or nearest hospital which helps users in quick decision making.},

pages={1-4},
abstract={In this paper, the Quality of Service (QoS) for a concrete network based in the prospective idea of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is estimated. We use the well-known mathematical convolution for the segments of the network. This methodology is applied using the simple definition of efficiency per segment. The first segment assumes the communication between nanosensor and intra-body device, whereas in the second one the intra-body device is engaged to the bio-cyber interface through the THz band. Others segments belong to the macroscopic scale but working in the MHz band. When the full QoS is estimated and assuming the most optimistic scenario, our crude estimation for the concrete case applied to nanomedicine has turned out to to be of order of 85%. In the other side, the lowest values of QoS would yield numbers below 50% by which the network might be running in those scenarios where traffic in cloud might degrade the IoBNT substantially.},

abstract={The stator/rotor winding fault is the major kind of fault in induction motor systems. Incipient winding fault detection and isolation can not only improve the reliability of motors, but also avoid serious failures in the entire traction system of high-speed trains. Such that, the incipient fault detection and isolation of stator/rotor winding fault is urgently demanded. Firstly, the mathematical model of squirrel caged induction motor system is established, based on which, the incipient winding fault modeling and fault analysis are also obtained. Then, a robust observer based incipient fault detection/isolation scheme is proposed for the possible incipient winding faults. Simulation results of this paper show that the incipient fault diagnosis scheme proposed not only has high sensitivity for incipient winding faults but also can accurately isolate faulty winding, which has certain reference value in practical engineering applications.},

abstract={Advances in the information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Thing(IoT). IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed - such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database. Hence the system provides quality healthcare to all. This paper is a review of Healthcare Monitoring system using IoT.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are engineered solutions obtained through the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components. Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets. Some considerations about major measurement challenges that the CPS self-awareness feature - oses in maintenance and troubleshooting operations are then drawn. Concluding remarks are finally reported.},

abstract={The increasing IoT technology provides large volume of data from various industrial applications, but the gap between the conventional automatic management system and the industry 4.0 system is how to convert the data to information, and then how to use the information to better assist the decision support and optimization in various aspects, including scheduling, planning, supply chain optimization, etc. Cyber physical systems connect the physical assets with the cyber computational capability, in which smart analytics are applied to make the invisible issues transparency and enable rapid and optimized decision-making. In this paper, a framework of CPS is presented to describe the CPS as a 5C architecture, including Connection level, Conversion level, Cyber level, Cognition level and Configuration level. The 5C architecture clearly states how to convert data to information; so the transparency and predictability enable to predict the degradation of the critical assets so as to use the information for smarter decision support. The transformation from traditional maintenance strategy to predictive maintenance strategy is the highlight to enable the worry-free entities. In order to fully understand the CPS architecture and how it can be applied to various industrial applications to realize a worry-free system, two successful case studies of CPS applications are introduced to present the application of CPS enabled cyber manufacturing with critical component health management as an example, and the worry-free wind turbine health management system.},

abstract={In a very short time, the Internet has dramatically changed how we work, live, play, and learn. Yet, we have barely scratched the surface. Using existing and new technologies, we are connecting the physical world to the Internet. It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration. Based on the type of data transmission; proactive or reactive, these devices will process and provide the data for the health monitoring company to take the correct action when patient's state of health moves outside normal range. Finally, the proposed model was simulated by using Packet tracer 7.},

abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},

Heating and cooling equipment (HVAC) are important support equipment for sensitive industrial systems including manufacturing, IT, high tech testing and measuring equipment. Therefore it is important to monitor functionality and health of this sensitive equipment. Moreover, it is critical to track failures in these systems as they are indicative of future outages of the supported systems. In this paper, we present an IoT based module that monitors the heating cooling element. The module can detect outages in HVAC equipment and notify operators about the sensitive system failures following these events. The module has been deployed to find that it detects the system failures can relay this information to operators to act timely. Therefore, improves the system reliability. Moreover, the module can support logging of HVAC equipment as well as supported sensitive equipment power usage to generate usage patterns and allow operators identify key trends and potential problems.},

abstract={PC4HC (Personalized Communication for Health Care) intends to create a communication platform tailored to people with multimorbidity and healthcare facilities that manage the care process. The project aims at: (1) Providing patients and healthcare facilities with a concise, clear and communicative interpretation of data from heterogeneous sources such as anamnestic, anthropometric, clinical and instrumental data (in particular, data obtainable from wearable sensors and so-called personal health systems). For this purpose, we plan to set up an infrastructure with high computational capabilities that is able to process large amounts of data (Big Data) and identify new associations (Data Mining) between variables that can enrich communication and generate new knowledge. (2) Promoting a patient empowerment approach aimed at making the patient fully aware of the significance of a specific piece of information and the implications that it entails for the patient's state of health and wellbeing. To this end, we applied the principles of persuasive computing technology, i.e. technologies developed in order to influence and possibly modify habits and lifestyle choices through persuasion and awareness. (3) Implementing effective strategies to maintain health and a healthy lifestyle, as well as to provide integrated and optimized management of acute and chronic pathologies with an economic and social benefit for both individuals and the healthcare system. The platform, designed and developed to address multimorbidity, identifies as a validation scope an innovative model of personalized communication for people in dialysis treatment.},

abstract={Smart Mobility is one of the main directions of transportation systems development in Smart Cities. In this case along with intellectualization of management the issue of transition to “green”, safe and sustainable modes of transport, such as bicycle, should be solved. Democracy and availability, cheapness and environmental friendliness, promotion of healthy lifestyle are the reasons for the growing popularity of this mode of transport all over the world. This paper proposes one of the possible ways of bicycle transport development in smart city, that allows expanding the number of users by reducing physical requirements for cyclist. The proposed development represents a concept of the Smart Bike that monitors condition of the cyclist and environment and turns on electric motor in critical situations. This reduces physical load of cyclist, as well as the battery consumption, that positively affects the ecology of Smart Cities.},

abstract={Recently, loT based healthcare systems have evolved as a tool to enhance the quality of life of people. This kind of system allows medical professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) to verify continuously the health conditions of their patients. As the healthcare systems manage highly sensitive physiological information of patients such as blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse, they are extremely vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care. In Gope-Hwang scheme, the authors proposed a lightweight anonymous authentication protocol and claimed that their scheme was secure. Unfortunately, this paper finds that Gope-Hwang scheme still has security pitfalls and limitations. This paper describes and cryptanalyzes the Gope-Hwang scheme to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security limitations. Then, it proposes an enhanced lightweight anonymous authentication scheme that solves the discovered security flaws. Additionally, this work executes security and performance analysis to demonstrate how the proposed protocol is more appropriate for a safe healthcare systems..},

One of the approaches is to monitor the health state of the patient and screen it to doctors or paramedical staff through the IoT, as it is hard to screen the patient for 24 hours. So here the patient health condition or status i.e. Pulse rate, Respiratory rate, Body Temperature, Position of the body, Blood glucose, ECG and so on can be measured by utilizing the Non-invasive sensors. These sensors are associated with the Arduino Uno board, it gathers the information i.e. biomedical data from the sensors and the detected biomedical information can be transmitted to the server. The “Thingspeak” named new cloud is utilized here to place the detected information into the server. From this server the information can be envisioned to the specialists and other paramedical staff by Thingspeak android app. In this way by utilizing this Smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of specialists and paramedical staffs to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore lessens the time and cost of support.},

abstract={Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are electronic devices implanted within human body for diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.},

abstract={Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},

Different pattern recognition algorithms are tested and compared. The highest accuracy and reliability in assessing the data are support vector machines and feedforward neural networks with a performance of 90 % probability in identifying the correct patients' activities over the test period.

abstract={Smart cities are becoming a reality. Various aspects of modern cities are being automated and integrated with information and communication technologies to achieve higher functionality, optimized resources utilization, and management, and improved quality of life for the residents. Smart cities rely heavily on utilizing various software, hardware, and communication technologies to improve the operations in areas, such as healthcare, transportation, energy, education, logistics, and many others, while reducing costs and resources consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT provides a platform for linking the cyber parts of a smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city, including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals, and other resources. Another useful technology is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable localized and real-time support for operating-enhanced smart city services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing is not an easy task. This paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing. We propose an SOM called SmartCityWare for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog Computing. SmartCityWare abstracts services and components involved in smart city applications as services accessible through the service-oriented model. This enhances integration and allows for flexible inclusion and utilization of the various services needed in a smart city application. In addition, we discuss the implementation and experimental issues of SmartCityWare and demonstrate its use through examples of smart city applications.},

The new ecosystem includes: an interoperable hospital information system to store electronic medical records (EMRs) and transfer them to a PHR system via email; a public cloud that supports encrypted data sharing for big data analysis services; a PHR gateway repository based on an IoT module which communicates with hospitals and public clouds; and a mobile application to manage and view PHR. This system can store and share raw EMR and life log data based on the healthcare communication standard "HL7 FHIR". To validate the usability of the interconnected PHR system, a clinical trial is underway to develop an obesity management model from individuals' hospital-provided genomic data, on the one hand, and diet and exercise logs gathered by the mobile application, on the other.

abstract={In recent years, bicycles have quickly become one of the major urban sports. At the same time, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded system combine IoT devices are widely used and making computing truly ubiquitous. Although bicycles have various functions, they fail to provide cyclists with sufficient exercise-related information and post-exercise analysis. Therefore, this paper introduced a bicycle record system of ground conditions based on IoT which is combining smartphone and embedded system. The event data recorder comprised two parts, a “smartphone-based event data recorder”and “bicycle-based real-time information feedback system". Using the event data recorder, this paper integrated and provided various types of real-time information for cyclists while they cycled to help them achieve their desired exercise results. After cycling, the cyclists could view cycling-related information through software analysis. This information included cycling routes taken, total cycling distance, and total calories burned. The event data recorder also saved information related to cycling routes, such as acceleration, deceleration, directional changes, and slope changes. By analyzing the recorded information, cyclists not only gained further insight into their exercise results but were also able to share cycling-related information through the Internet, which would benefit cyclists who had not cycled along this route before. By developing the bicycle record system, this paper aimed to provide cyclists with real-time, accurate, and complete information, enabling them to enjoy a consummate cycling environment.},

abstract={Electric energy networks provide the energy necessary to carry out daily operations in education, health care, commerce, entertainment, defense, and government. Smart grids (SG) have been proposed as a mechanism to modernize and facilitate the operation of energy grids in the presence of multiple third-parties vying to sell electricity and related services. Recently, a new concept has emerged in relation with SG: transactive energy - a framework to integrate and coordinate multiple independent suppliers of electric services in an economic marketplace that enables purchases in a way that obeys the physical constrains of the underlying energy grid. Our team is developing a transactive energy framework called Open Access Smart Grids (OASIS). OASIS features a distribution-level marketplace where the underlying electric resources and services are open to access and provisioned by third parties. In this paper, we present a cloudbased and big data-enabled brokerage system for Smart grids, which is a critical component of OASIS. In this brokerage system, consumer energy requests, and energy bids issued by producers, are collected and matched to find a list of energy purchase orders to be dispatched to the winning producers. A central piece in the system is an energy broker software agent, which drives the bidding process.},

However, the scale and complexity of personalized service is increasing with wildly applied to our life, which cause response time decrease and resource waste in large-scale IoT-Based Healthcare application. Therefore, it is necessary of studying on dealing with the large-scale and complexity of personalized services in large-scale IoT-Based Healthcare application. In this paper, we propose proactive personalized service leveraging Complex Event Processing (CEP) to deal with a large number and complexity of personalized services. Firstly, personalized service defined as complex event pattern that expresses in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Secondly, we propose a complex event pattern partitioning and clustering algorithms to optimize the processing of dealing with personalized services.

abstract={Fog computing is considered as the most promising enhancement of the traditional cloud computing paradigm in order to handle potential issues introduced by the emerging Interned of Things (IoT) framework at the network edge. The heterogeneous nature, the extensive distribution and the hefty number of deployed IoT nodes will disrupt existing functional models, creating confusion. However, IoT will facilitate the rise of new applications, with automated healthcare monitoring platforms being amongst them. This paper presents the pillars of design for such applications, along with the evaluation of a working prototype that collects ECG traces from a tailor-made device and utilizes the patient's smartphone as a Fog gateway for securely sharing them to other authorized entities. This prototype will allow patients to share information to their physicians, monitor their health status independently and notify the authorities rapidly in emergency situations. Historical data will also be available for further analysis, towards identifying patterns that may improve medical diagnoses in the foreseeable future.},

pages={1327-1337},
abstract={The computer-aided diagnosis for histopathological images has attracted considerable attention. Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.},

The evolution of electronic devices and systems has already enabled societal changes. Inroads in the quantification of medicine, in the discovery and applications of biosensors in connection with integrated circuit technology, in the analysis of large-scale real-time biomedical data are strong indicators that cyber-medical systems will redesign health care in the years to come. To sustain this thesis, this paper presents three aspects of cyber-medical systems, describes their medical significance and potentials, and then delves in the detailed technology required to realize such systems. Specifically, this paper describes state of the art sensing devices and their integration into platforms, data processing for ultrasound medical imaging and system correctness approaches for drug administration support systems.

abstract={Many countries are facing burdens on their health care systems due to ageing populations. A promising strategy to address the problem is to allow selected people to remain in their homes and be monitored using recent advances in wearable devices, saving in-hospital resources. With respect to heart monitoring, wearable devices to date have principally used optical techniques by shining light through the skin. However, these techniques are severely hampered by motion artifacts and are limited to heart rate detection. Further, these optical devices consume a large amount of power in order to receive a sufficient signal, resulting in the need for frequent battery recharging. To address these shortcomings we present a new wrist ECG wearable that is similar to the clinical approach for heart monitoring. Our device weighs less than 30 g, and is ultra low power, extending the battery lifetime to over a month to make the device more appropriate for in-home health care applications. The device uses two electrodes activated by the user to measure the voltage across the wrists. The electrodes are made from a flexible ink and can be painted on to the device casing, making it adaptable for different shapes and users. In this paper we show how the ECG sensor can be integrated into an existing IoT wearable and compare the device's accuracy against other common commercial devices.},

abstract={The average age of the world's population is increasing, and life expectancy will increase by an extra 10 years by the year 2050. The growing number of older adults increases the demands on public health systems and the related care costs. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support integrated healthcare services in elderly homecare can make an important contribution to reducing such costs. The SOCIALIZE AAL project aims to create a new reference platform for the elderly by applying technological solutions to simplify their daily activities and the means by which they access dedicated services in order to improve their quality of life. This paper describes the Elderly Monitoring service - an IoT module of the SOCIALIZE platform, whose aim is to collect environmental and physical user data so that they can be supervised by medical and caregiver staffs. The system has been designed to enable easy addition and/or substitution of new services and devices within the environment. To this end, the service implements a framework that enables heterogeneous devices belonging to different domotic systems and protocols to directly share data, thereby implementing an infrastructure suitable for the fulfillment of a real Social IoT (SIoT).},

abstract={The goal of this paper is to raise awareness to the fact that the choice of data storage system is an increasingly significant one to make and to propose a number of dimensions to categorize such systems in a simple yet meaningful way. Many data subjects already use some kind of data service to store their messages, pictures, music, videos, etc. and in the light of increasing data production and a growing number of data-based services, this trend is expected to continue. Advancing from storing pop songs to storing personal health or geo-location data, however, requires data subjects to get themselves acquainted with the quality features of data storage providers, should they wish to make an informed decision. The introduction chapter explores the consequences of the GDPR implementation in the European Union regarding the expectations towards storage of personal data, while the subsequent chapter explains the labeling decisions in this paper. The two ensuing chapters present the quality criteria for data storage widely used in contemporary reviews and completes them with additional dimensions advocated for by the author. In a final step, a quick assessment of popular data storage providers is made, using the discussed dimensions, to demonstrate the categorical imbalance in the data storage provider community.},

We mainly focus on monitoring blood pressure, glucose and temperature in rural areas where cellular network coverage is either absent or does not allow data transmission. The main objective is to reduce the burden of long trips for people living in these areas to visit healthcare facilities, while minimizing the communication cost. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the area covered by the LoRa network and the power consumption of our system. The results indicate that the average area covered is around 33 km2 when the LoRa Gateway is placed outdoor on a 12 meter altitude. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the power consumption of our monitoring system is at least ten times lower than other long range cellular solutions, such as GPRS/3G/4G.},

We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},

abstract={Today smart devices such as smartphones, smartwatches and activity trackers are widely available and accepted in most developed societies. These devices present a broad set of sensors capable of extracting detailed information about different situations of daily life, which, if used for good, have the potential to improve the quality of life not only for individuals but also for the society in general. One of the key areas where this type of information can help to improve the quality of life is in healthcare since it allows to monitor and infer the current level of well-being of the smart devices carriers. In this paper, some of the available literature about well-being sensing through context-aware data is reviewed. Also, the main types of mechanisms used in these studies are identified. These mechanisms are related to monitoring, generalization, inference, feedback, energy management and privacy. Furthermore, a description of the mechanisms used in each study is presented.},

abstract={The appearance of the Internet of Things topic has a huge impact on several research fields including human activity recognition (HAR) where wearable sensors provide the raw information about the physical activity and functional ability of an observed person. Previous studies have shown that HAR can be seen as a general machine learning problem with a particular data pre-processing stage. In the last years, several researchers reached high recognition rates on public data sets or in laboratory environment but their solutions have not tested yet in real-life. Therefore, this paper investigates the efficiency of previously used machine learning strategies in real environment by an Android-base, self-learning HAR application which has been designed according to the latest HAR solutions. The result of this study shows a significant recognition rate difference between the “online” (real-time) and “offline” cases.},

abstract={Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a great impact on human health. Nowadays, the public basically gets information about UV radiation through weather forecasts, which can only provide rough and average prediction for a certain large area. Since CMOS sensors in smartphone cameras are very sensitive to UV radiation, smartphones have potential to be the ideal equipment to measure it. At the same time, result optimization can be achieved in real time by taking advantage of fog computing because fog servers are able to aggregate UV radiation data and compute the results at local areas. This paper exhaustively discussed a novel procedure that could measure UV radiation through smartphone cameras, and also briefly covered how to leverage fog computing to improve UV measurement accuracy. To implement the procedure, an Android app called UV meter was developed. Experiments were conducted by utilizing the app to validate and evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the procedure on both smartphones and smart watches. Results showed that the proposed procedure could achieve an average of 95% accuracy of a typical professional digital UV meter, and could be easily implemented on smart devices.},

abstract={Accurate radar characterization of respiration can allow sleep diagnostics, and unique identification. A low distortion DC coupled system with high signal to noise ratio is required for such characterization and classification. This is especially critical with small signals as with through wall measurements with poor signal to noise ratio (SNR). This paper proposes a technique to improve signal to noise ratio by DC offset management and using the method of zooming in the fractions of the respiratory cycle waveform. Experimental results show a gain increment of 195 and 42% reduction of error in unique identification by complexity analysis techniques. Unique identification of human subjects behind walls has many potential applications such as, security, health monitoring, IoT applications, and virtual reality, and this technique can also benefit respiratory health diagnostics applications.},

abstract={The use of artificial satellites for navigational purposes started with Sputnik-I on 04th October, 1957. Transit-I was the first navigation satellite system and observations made on signals from the first Sputnik was started in December 1958. And thus Transit-I became a worldwide navigation system starting from 1964. Soon, it became clear that a global navigation satellite system had much to offer particularly for military users. Consequently, Following the system design studies during 1967-1969, U.S. DoD (Department of Defence) developed a worldwide a space-based navigation system in 1970s. And this system was called as NAVSTAR GPS (NAVigation Satellites by Timing And Ranging Global Positioning System). GPS, originally, was developed to satisfy the U.S. military operational need for a precise navigation system and has been used only for U.S. military purposes until 1980s. But later realizing its potential civil uses, it has been opened to all users free of charge starting from 1980. On the other hand, development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976 and the “constellation” was completed in 1995. With the advent of GLONASS system, the term GNSS was begun to be used. As an economic and globally available accurate source of positioning and timing information, GNSS contributes to emerging technologies and applications. Some widely used GNSS-related emerging trends are LBS, multi-modality (road, aviation, maritime and rail), agriculture, surveying, Internet of Things, Big Data, Augmented Reality, Smart Cities, and Multimodal Logistics. On the other hand, using positioning info from GNSS and satellite images from, e.g., QuickBird data, together with digital maps (e.g. Google Earth/Maps) have increased their importance at the national and international levels. And thus, obtaining and using above mentioned data have brought some administrative and legal problems together.},

Our experience shows that correlations between sensors effectively predict failures because the correlations usually reflect the status of equipment with higher sensitivity. In this paper, we present a method that exploits correlations between sensors for pre-processing and enables anomalies to be detected using both sensor data and correlations. The method was evaluated by applying it to compact electric generators, and the results showed it detected anomalies more accurately than when only sensor data were used. This method is expected to predict failures earlier and reduce the cost of downtime and maintenance.},

abstract={In recent times food safety has drawn upsurge of academic and commercial concerns. In supply chain area, with the rapid growth of internet technologies, a lot of emerging technologies have been applied in traceability systems. However, to date, nearly all of these systems are centralized which are monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque that could result in the trust problem, such as fraud, corruption, tampering and falsifying information. Besides, centralized system is vulnerable to collapse, since a single point of breakdown will lead the whole system to be crashed. Today, a new technology called the blockchain which is a ground-breaking innovation in decentralized information technology presents a whole new approach. However, since this technology is still in its early stages, it has some inherent defects, in which scalability become a primary and urgent one when we face the mass data in the real world. In this paper we will build a food supply chain traceability system for real-time food tracing based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), blockchain and Internet of things, which could provide an information platform for all the supply chain members with openness, transparency, neutrality, reliability and security. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept BigchainDB to fill the gap in the decentralized systems at scale. The paper concludes with a description of a use case and the challenges to adopt blockchain technology in the future food supply chain traceability systems are discussed.},

Studies show that between 2015 and 2016 beekeepers lost 44% of bee colonies over the winter, this is up about 10% from the previous decade. Causes for this decline is correlated to the overall hive health. The healthier the hive the more likely it is to survive the winter. Current technology dictates humans check the hives for Varroa Mite infestations, poor moisture levels, and other telling signs of an unhealthy hive. These checks are invasive to the bee colonies and only happen once or twice a year. This projects aims to create a “Smart Hive” that can be monitored from the cloud that will have high resolution (spacial and temporal) data recorded from a variety of sensors to assist beekeepers in keeping their hives healthy. The “Smart Hive” will be added to the George Mason Universities' Honey Bee Initiative's collection of hives. Realtime “Smart Hive” data will be made available to the public, and all systems developed will be made opensource.},

abstract={Watching and health care for the elderly are one of promising application fields of IoT. Among them, detecting and preventing indoor heat stroke conditions is a crucial issue. We propose a method for monitoring indoor environment, detecting any risky conditions, and then effectively warning them to the elderly. Since elderly people have different physical weaknesses such as low vision and poor hearing, we designed and developed a system for alerting the elderly through multi-sensory information presentation. It can convey risky situations to the elderly via visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli.},

abstract={Contemporary solutions for cloud-supported, edge-data analytics mostly apply analytics techniques in a rigid bottom-up approach, regardless of the data's origin. Typically, data are generated at the edge of the infrastructure and transmitted to the cloud, where traditional data analytics techniques are applied. Currently, developers are forced to resort to ad hoc solutions specifically tailored for the available infrastructure (for example, edge devices) when designing, developing, and operating the data analytics applications. Here, a novel approach implements cloud-supported, real-time data analytics in edge-computing applications. The authors introduce their serverless edge-data analytics platform and application model and discuss their main design requirements and challenges, based on real-life healthcare use case scenarios.},

The analysis results about the wetness levels of the diaper (dry, slightly wet, wet and very wet) are represented by four emoticons (happy, mild, uncomfortable and crying). Based on the analysis results, the Goo9 system sends the corresponding emoticons, temperature/humidity numbers and diaper change reminders to the Android or iOS mobile phones of baby caretakers.

abstract={IoT is an emerging area with revolutionary applications in areas like transportation, health care, energy, and agriculture etc. It can be realized through the massive deployment of IoT devices in the physical world. But massive deployment comes with severe security concerns. IoT devices are capable of running operating systems within themselves. An adversary may tamper or clone these IoT devices for his or her benefit. Most of the modern operating systems today use attack prevention techniques based on No-eXecute (NX) memory page protection scheme, which prevents execution of malicious code injected into the device. But, Return Oriented Programming (ROP) has the capability to break this security cover and take control over the IoT device. In this paper we present an effective implementation of the ROP, used as a defensive weapon against code tampering by adversaries. We also propose techniques to choose the best gadget set for building the ROP chain.},

Security is a critical requirement of the standards and protocols for these environments. One suite of layered protocols within WPAN is ZigBee. ZigBee is a low bit rate protocol utilised in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Attacks such as physical, crypto key interception, injection and replay are perpetrated on ZigBee networks. These attacks can be instigated and controlled within the physical ZigBee WSN location or via a gateway. This paper creates a honeypot that simulates a ZigBee gateway. It is designed to assess the presence of ZigBee attack intelligence on a SSH attack vector. It captures all attack traffic for retrospective analysis. It sandboxes attacks of interest to determine if any attempts are targeting ZigBee specifically. Finally it concludes that all captured mass attacks are mainstream DDoS and bot malware, whereas individual attackers where attracted to and interacted with the ZigBee simulated Honeypot.},

Further, the exchange of information and subsequent data analysis on the MHS makes the system intelligent and smart. In any standard battlefield scenario, there is a command and control center that correlates the events happening in real time. We have made this command and control center as semantic edge component. This center is entrusted with making vital decisions on the tactical arena of the battlefield. The main aim of the proposed architecture is to provide secured zone to monitor soldiers health and their weapons conditions, respectively.

Classical body area networks have been reduced to small, wearable devices such as smart watches where signal acquisition is accompanied by processing or streaming to a more powerful device such as a smart phone (or “fog”), or directly to the Cloud. We present a system based around EPIC electric potential sensors which are capable of acquiring bio-electric signals, including an electrocardiogram-like signal (ECG). The paper compares a set of validation algorithms for the extraction of Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR) suitable for use on EPIC sensor data acquired with the proposed system. These algorithms are evaluated in terms of precision and the estimated robustness and variance. The system is of particular relevance in the field of Augmented and Virtual Reality, in which such a miniaturised, wireless platform becomes a necessity [1].},

abstract={Energy Neutral Operation (ENO) has created the ability to continuously operate wireless sensor networks in areas such as environmental monitoring, hazard detection and industrial IoT applications. Current ENO approaches utilise techniques such as sample rate control, adaptive duty cycling and data reduction methods to balance energy generation, storage and consumption. However, the state of the art approaches makes a strong and unrealistic assumption that battery capacity is fixed throughout the deployment time of an application. This results in scenarios where ENO systems over allocate sensing tasks, therefore as battery capacity degrades it causes the system to no longer be energy neutral and then fail unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the problem to maximise the quality-of-service in terms of duty cycle and the battery capacity to extend the deployment lifetime of a sensing application. In addition, we develop a lightweight algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed method using real sensor energy consumption data captured from micro-climate sensors deployed in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London. Results show that a 307% extension of deployment lifetime can be achieved when compared to a traditional ENO solution without a reduction in the duty cycle of the sensor.},

They include multimodal user interface (MMUI), augmented reality (AR), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), and machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. The ecosystem is based on the Cloud-Fog-Dew computing paradigm services, providing a full symbiosis by integrating the whole range from low level sensors up to high level services using integration efficiency inherent in synergistic use of applied technologies. Inside of this ecosystem, all of them are encapsulated in the following network layers: Dew, Fog, and Cloud computing layer. Instead of the “spaghetti connections”, “mosaic of buttons”, “puzzles of output data”, etc., the proposed ecosystem provides the strict division in the following dataflow channels: consumer interaction channel, machine interaction channel, and caregiver interaction channel. This concept allows to decrease the physical, cognitive, and mental load on elderly care stakeholders by decreasing the secondary human-to-human (H2H), human-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-human (M2H) interactions in favor of M2M interactions and distributed Dew Computing services environment.

abstract={In recent times indoor air quality has attracted the attention of policy makers and researchers as an important similar to that of external air pollution. In certain sense, indoor air quality must be paid more attention than outdoor air quality as people spend more time indoors than outdoors. The indoor environments are confined and closed compared to external environments providing less opportunity for the pollutants to dilute. With the advancement of technology, working places have become more automated using machines to carry out the tasks that were hitherto done manually. These devices emit various solids and gases into the environment during their operation. These emissions contain many substances that are harmful to human health, when exposed to them for a prolonged period of time or more than certain levels of concentration. This paper proposes an IoT based indoor air quality monitoring system for tracking the ozone concentrations near a photocopy machine. The experimental system with a semiconductor sensor capable of monitoring ozone concentrations was installed near a high volume photocopier. The IoT device has been programmed to collect and transmit data at an interval of five minutes over blue tooth connection to a gateway node that in turn communicates with the processing node via the WiFi local area network. The sensor was calibrated using the standard calibration methods. As an additional capability, the proposed air pollution monitoring system can generate warnings when the pollution level exceeds beyond a predetermined threshold value.},

abstract={Implementation of precision apiculture methods into practice is highly depended on availability and cost-effectiveness of honey bee monitoring equipment. Expenses of monitoring system installation and maintenance activities also should be minimized. In order to successfully predict different bee colony states like: swarming, determine nectar collection activity and health of honey bees both in active and passive wintering period, minimum hive parameters that should be monitored are temperature and mass. This research presents conceptual design of Internet of Thing approach for the beekeeping. As well honey bee colony temperature monitoring system based on local wireless sensor network together with GSM/GPRS external interface for packet-based communication with remote server on the Internet is developed. Logical topology of the local network is star with one central module. The hive group consists of 10 units. Each hive in the group is equipped with integral temperature sensor chip (±0.4°C accuracy), low power microcontroller and radio frequency (RF) transceiver module. All components are powered by alkaline cell battery, which can provide energy for one year minimum of autonomous operation with 10-minute data logging interval. The central module is also placed on one of the hives and consists of temperature sensor, RF and GSM/GPRS modules, photovoltaic cell array, battery, charge controller and minimal user interface for operational status reporting. The system allows sensor data logging to local storage and periodic sending to a remote server for further detailed analysis in user web or mobile application.},

abstract={In recent years, there is an increased interest toward Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with the introduction of application areas such as industrial internet, m-Health and Smart Grid. WSNs consist of sensors with wireless capability operating autonomously and reporting application specific parameters to a central entity. Many applications including industrial applications require the WSN to have a low and deterministic delay. Having a deterministic network delay in a WSN is challenging in the best case when traditional Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are employed. To enable low power, high reliability and deterministic WSNs, IETF recently proposed 6TiSCH protocol which uses time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) MAC with IPv6 addressing. This protocol dynamically assigns bandwidth resources to the nodes in the network according to the application requirements. This paper describes an implementation of 6TiSCH protocol in Contiki OS and a distributed scheduling mechanism for this protocol. We evaluate the protocol performance using Cooja simulator for different networking scenarios and compare it to that of a slotted Aloha type access mechanism.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have proven to be an effective and dynamic paradigm for many applications, including structural health monitoring and tracking systems. However, the supply of energy to the sensors plays a key role in the success of these applications as well as the design and deployment of these networks. Currently, most WSNs are powered by batteries, which must be replaced frequently, increasing maintenance costs and operational complexity. In this paper, we propose a practical framework, called wirelessly energy-charged (WINCH), for battery maintenance; it involves recharging sensor batteries using mobile robots. This framework integrates a routing process in which the cluster heads are selected optimally, as in the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized protocol (LEACH-C), and the robots visit the sites frequently based on need and place themselves in the optimal positions with respect to the selected cluster heads. This approach considerably reduces overhead compared with existing methods. Moreover, we have developed an empirical model of the energy charging rate for sensor nodes. We use this model to compute the amount of energy harvested by each sensor in the proximity of the mobile charger. Simulation experiments for a wide range of design parameters and using several metrics, such as energy consumption, network throughput, and coverage, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with an existing work.},

abstract={Fog computing is an architectural style in which network components between devices and the cloud execute application-specific logic. We present the first review on fog computing within healthcare informatics, and explore, classify, and discuss different application use cases presented in the literature. For that, we categorize applications into use case classes and list an inventory of application-specific tasks that can be handled by fog computing. We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud. These findings substantiate the need for a coherent approach toward fog computing in healthcare, for which we present a list of recommended research and development actions.},

abstract={Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising technology for realizing energy-efficient wireless sensors for long-term health monitoring. However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},

E-health applications in IoT networks are the newest area of interest in this research field. On the other hand, networking and communications fields are witnessing a revolution through the new concepts of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) characterised by latency sensitivity and geographical awareness. Moreover, the Software Defined Network (SDN) is an innovative network paradigm that allows programming of the network through the separation of the data plane and the control plane and provides global intelligence for the network. We marry this technologies to propose a novel IoT e-health service; Real-time Heart Attack Mobile Detection Service (RHAMDS) through voice control and gesture control using smart watches. RHAMDS aims to improve response time of emergency aid for heart attack patients, in vehicular networks in particular, and to prevent the possible resulting vehicle collisions.

year={2017},

pages={1-2},
abstract={According to a study done in 2014 by National Health Interview Survey around 6.3 million children in United States suffer from asthma [1]. Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth1, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using - n inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.},

abstract={A device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network is pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications, since it is expected to bring the significant benefits of improving user throughput, extending the battery life of mobiles, etc. However, D2D and cellular communications in the same network may cause cross-tier interference (CTI) to each other. Also a critical issue of using D2D assisted cellular networks under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical equipments. In consideration of CTI and EMI, we study the problem of optimizing individual channel rates of the mobile users in different priorities (different levels of emergency) within the Internet of Vehicles for mobile health, and propose an algorithm of controlling the transmit power to solve the above-mentioned problem under a game-theoretical framework. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can converge linearly to the optimum, while ensuring an allowable level of EMI on medical equipments.},

abstract={Rural and urban areas are linked. A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes "in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand". This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], "more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products; the majority of these people live in developing countries" [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urba- areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] "the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks". In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter. The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.},

Tens of billions of devices are now connected to the Internet and quintillion bytes of data are generated from sensing devices every day. One of the important applications of IoT systems in industry is monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis of manufacturing systems (MFDM). However, current practices in the development of such systems are individualized with each company developing their own solutions. To address this issue, we propose a SaaS-centered framework for manufacturing system health management. The configurability and easy evolution of SaaS can facilitate reuse and sharing of data, processes, and technologies. Besides the general framework, we also look into the technologies that are important for the framework. The literature in time series data storage and the techniques for mining correlated data are reviewed and the gaps are identified.

abstract={As semiconductor manufacturing processes are becoming more and more sophisticated, how to maintain their feasible production yield becomes an important issue. Also, how to build a smart manufacturing platform that can facilitate realizing smart factories is essential and desirable for current manufacturing industries. Aimed at addressing the above-mentioned two issues, in this letter, a five-stage approach for enhancing and assuring yield is proposed. Also, a smart manufacturing platform- Advanced Manufacturing Cloud of Things (AMCoT) based on Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems, and prediction technologies is designed and implemented to realize the proposed five-stage approach of yield enhancement and assurance. Finally, AMCoT is applied to a bumping process of a semiconductor company in Taiwan to conduct industrial case studies. Testing results demonstrate that AMCoT possesses capabilities of conducting total inspection in production, providing prognosis, and predictive maintenance on equipment, finding the root cause of yield loss, and storing and handling big production data, which as a whole is promising to achieve the goal of zero defects.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) will connect billions of smart devices and generate inundant data through prominent solutions, such as machine type communication. The Third Generation Partnership Project has launched the corresponding standards for multiple heterogeneous wireless smart devices in the long term evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced. In the forthcoming years, the valuable information hidden in the deluge of data will be extracted and utilized in every field to improve quality and efficiency. However, the bottleneck of realizing this magnificent vista of future intelligent lives lies in how to satisfy the practical demands to transmit huge data volume through efficient wireless communication in diverse scenarios. Herein, multi-scenario wireless communication triggers critical problems in wireless channel modeling and soundings for 5G IoT, which by far, are understudied. In this paper, we introduce a general wireless channel model and its multiple up-to-date corresponding channel sounding methods for future 5G IoT green wireless communication. Through adopting the perspective of wireless big data excavation, the smart channel sounder transforms the traditional passive wireless communication scheme into an active expectation-guaranteed wireless communication scheme, which helps achieve efficient and green communication. To demonstrate the validity and efficiency of this smart sounder scheme, we make a compatible prototype testified in multiple scenarios. The multiple real-scenario experiments demonstrate that the smart sounder can function effectively, especially in those scenarios where traditional channel state information is not available or imperfect.},

abstract={Wireless health systems enable remote and continuous monitoring of individuals, with applications in elderly care support, chronic disease management, and preventive care. The underlying sensing platform provides constructs that consider the quality of information driven from the system and ensure the reliability/validity of the outcomes to support the decision-making processes. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate contextual information within the data processing flow in order to improve the quality of measurements. We focus on a pilot application that uses wearable motion sensors to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of exergaming movements. Exergames need to show energy expenditure values, often using accelerometer approximations applied to general activities. We focus on two contextual factors, namely “activity type” and “sensor location,” and demonstrate how these factors can be used to enhance the measured values, since allocating larger weights to more informative sensors can improve the final measurements. Further, designing regression models for each activity provides better results than any generalized model. Indeed, the averaged R2 value for the movements using simple sensor location improve from a general 0.71 to as high as 0.84 for an individual activity type. The different methods present a range of R2 value averages across activity type from 0.64 for sensor location to 0.89 for multidimensional regression, with an average game play MET value of 7.93. Finally, in a leaveone-subject-out cross validation, a mean absolute error of 2.231 METs is found when predicting the activity levels using the best models.},

abstract={With newly developed wireless neuroheadsets, electroencephalography (EEG) neurometrics can be incorporated into in situ and ubiquitous physiological monitoring for human mental health. As a resource constraint system providing critical health services, the EEG headset design must consider both high application fidelity and energy efficiency. However, through empirical studies with an off-the-shelf Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset, we uncover a mismatch between lossy EEG sensor communication and high neurometric application fidelity requirements. To tackle this problem, we study how to learn the sensitivity of neurometric application fidelity to EEG data. The learned sensitivity is used to develop two algorithms: 1) an energy minimization algorithm minimizing the energy usage in EEG sampling and networking while meeting applications' fidelity requirements and 2) a fidelity maximization algorithm maximizing the sum of all applications' fidelities through the incorporation and optimal utilization of a limited data buffer. The effectiveness of our proposed solutions is validated through trace-driven experiments.},

year={2016},

abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-sta- e concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},

abstract={Fall detection and localization of human operators inside a workspace are major issues in ensuring a safe working environment. Recent research has shown that the perturbations of the radio-frequency (RF) signals commonly adopted for wireless communications can also be used as sensing tools for device-free human motion detection. Device-free RF-based human sensing applications range from tag-less body localization to detection and monitoring of human well-being (e-Health). In this paper, we propose a real-time system for human body motion sensing with special focus on joint body localization and fall detection. The proposed system continuously monitors and processes the RF signals emitted by industry-compliant radio devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and supporting machine-to-machine communication functions. Human-induced diffraction and multipath phenomena that affect RF signal propagation are leveraged for body localization while for fall detection a hidden Markov model is applied to discern different postures of the operator and to detect safety-relevant events by tracking the received signal strength indicator footprints. Fall detection performances are corroborated by extensive experimental measurements in different settings. In addition, we propose also a sensor fusion tool that is able to integrate the device-free RF-based sensing system within an industrial image sensors framework. Preliminary results, conducted during field trial measurements, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of localization accuracy, and sensitivity/specificity to correctly detect a fall event from preimpact postures.},

abstract={Motion analysis technologies have been widely used to monitor the potential for injury and enhance athlete performance. However, most of these technologies are expensive, can only be used in laboratory environments, and examine only a few trials of each movement action. In this paper, we present a novel ambulatory motion analysis framework using wearable inertial sensors to accurately assess all of an athlete's activities in real training environment. We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.},

year={2016},
volume={3},

pages={1334-1345},
abstract={Symmetric encryption is the most widely adopted security solution for wireless sensor networks. The main open issue in this context is represented by the establishment of symmetric keys. Although many key management schemes have been proposed in order to guarantee a high security level, a solution without weaknesses does not yet exist. An important class of key management schemes is based on a transitory master key (MK). In this approach, a global secret is used during the initialization phase to generate pair-wise keys, and it is deleted during the working phase. However, if an adversary compromises a node before the deletion of the MK, the security of the whole network is compromised. In this paper, a new key negotiation routine is proposed. The new routine is integrated with a well-known key computation mechanism based on a transitory master secret. The goal of the proposed approach is to reduce the time required for the initialization phase, thus reducing the probability that the master secret is compromised. This goal is achieved by splitting the initialization phase in hierarchical subphases with an increasing level of security. An experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides a significant reduction in the time required before deleting the transitory secret material, thus increasing the overall security level. Moreover, the proposed scheme allows to add new nodes after the first deployment with a suited routine able to complete the key establishment in the same time as for the initial deployment.},

abstract={Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enables many applications such as smart grid, vehicular safety, and health care among many others. To achieve ubiquitous data transportation among objects and the surrounding environment, deploying spectrum sharing M2M communications with existing wireless networks is a must. A general large-scale cognitive M2M network (CM2MN), adopting cognitive radio technology, consists of multiradio systems, the primary system (PS), and secondary system(s) with tremendous cooperative cognitive machines, under heterogeneous wireless architecture. For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution, the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing in large CM2MNs.},

In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.},

abstract={Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has been a preferred encryption technology to solve the challenging problem of secure data sharing in cloud computing. The shared data files generally have the characteristic of multilevel hierarchy, particularly in the area of healthcare and the military. However, the hierarchy structure of shared files has not been explored in CP-ABE. In this paper, an efficient file hierarchy attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed in cloud computing. The layered access structures are integrated into a single access structure, and then, the hierarchical files are encrypted with the integrated access structure. The ciphertext components related to attributes could be shared by the files. Therefore, both ciphertext storage and time cost of encryption are saved. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be secure under the standard assumption. Experimental simulation shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient in terms of encryption and decryption. With the number of the files increasing, the advantages of our scheme become more and more conspicuous.},

abstract={With the embracing of mobile Internet of Things, participatory media is becoming a new battlefield for tobacco wars. However, how to automatically collect and analyze the large-scale user-generated data that are relevant to tobacco in participatory media is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach of sensing collective activities in tobacco-related participatory media. Meanwhile, we compare the temporal patterns, topological patterns, and collective emotion patterns among protobacco, antitobacco, and quit-tobacco groups. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was implemented to collect large-scale tobacco-related data sets from Facebook. This demonstrates that the proposed framework is feasible and reasonable. Our preliminary findings reveal that, first, tobacco-related content grows exponentially. In particular, the growth of the protobacco group follows the exponential law, whereas there is linear growth for the tobacco control group. Second, the connection between the tobacco control community and the tobacco cessation community is tight, whereas the nodes in the protobacco community are connected sparsely. Finally, the collective emotion in tobacco communities is negative.},

abstract={Load balancers and firewalls are entry points to many key websites in any network infrastructure. Any downtime due to these devices, even for a few minutes, may result in major business impact. There are many proactive event management systems/products which can monitor their health and alert on device failure. However, predicting failure with sufficient lead time still remains a challenging problem. Event management systems take system log messages and simple network management protocol (SNMP) traps as inputs and typically use rule based framework to generate network events. In this paper we discuss how we can use event data alone to build predictive model for device failures. Here all event data is generated by an event management tool. Event data volume is substantially less compared to full system log data. Also, these network devices fail rarely. Lower volume of event data enables us collect historical data for longer durations and thus collect decent number of failure samples over time which we can use for training and validation. We present a prediction model for failure events based on event sequence data. We have introduced new stratified sampling techniques along with a new feature engineering method using sliding time windows on event data. Experiments show that for rare device failure events like the load balancers it suffices to use event data to model device failures instead of using raw system log data. We have evaluated binary classification algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). Experimental results show that with the proper noise cleanup technique and model tuning we can achieve precision of 77% and recall of 67% for the failure predictions of network devices only from event data.},

abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},

abstract={Taichi Chuan is a traditional Chinese culture, containing the wisdom of the ancient Chinese people. It takes Taichi thoughts as its center and now becomes one of the traditional Chinese sports to keep in good health. Usually, it takes long time to learn Taichi Chuan and doesn't combine well with our daily life. Our paper introduces a imaginary Taichi suit in the future. The Taichi suit can real-time monitor your body signs and your surroundings. According to the relevant data, it can design a unique set of Taichi for you. Or it'll remind you and help you to avoid accidental collision with the outside world. Its mechanism is to use vary and several sensors inside and outside the suit. Inside sensors detect the wearer's heart rate, body temperature, respiration, movement fluency, and the corresponding conclusions such as the balance. According to the conclusions, users will exercise specific joints or parts of the body with the help of the suit to restore the body to health level. Outside sensors' function is to real-time monitor the wearer's surroundings and detect surrounding objects and their move speed to judge whether there's danger. Taichi suit stores each decomposition action of Taichi Chuan. It can intelligently select several actions and compose a set of movements suitable for the wearer to practice Taichi. There is a machine exoskeleton in the clothing material, which gives the wearer a certain external force to help the wearer move more accurately and conveniently to practice. Especially when several rapid motion objects appear to user, Taichi suit will warn the wearer. And at the same time, the exoskeleton will guide the wearer to avoid dangerous. As the essence of Taichi Chuan said: accomplish a great task with little effort by clever maneuvers, which is the source of our Taichi suit's this function thought},

abstract={Solenoid valves are vital pieces of equipment which have been widely used in a variety of industries. Fault detection methods of solenoid valves play important role for improving their reliability and maintenance efficiency due to their high failure rates in the field. Therefore, a novel method of fault detection for solenoid valves based on vibration signal measurement is proposed in this paper. The vibration sensor is place on the top of the solenoid valve and the vibration signal is collected by Labview SignalExpress system. The amplitude of the signal is extracted by denoising algorithm based on Wavelet and analyzed to detect the working state with the help of health index. The method is not interfered by the power supply system, and the method enhance the ability to resist interference. Experimental platform was set up to validate the proposed method by injecting faults into the solenoid valve. Experimental results show that the method proposed can provide not only indications of whether or not the valve is functioning, but also the information of how well the valve is functioning, thus empowering condition-based maintenance operations.},

abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).},

From monitoring of disease to the treatment of illnesses is realized to be much more effective than ever before. The ability to exchange, connect and share information about human anatomy via non-invasive methods of radiology, nuclear medicine has opened up an entire new genre of medicine. Having said that, 'image distribution' in medical field has always been a challenge for the reasons known. And one primary parameter which always questions the very aspect of distribution has been 'Data Security and Patient Privacy'.The advances in technology and BYOD(Bring Your Own Devices) nature in the IOT industry has changed the paradigm of healthcare industry. In today's connected world it becomes increasing imperative to address aspects like 'data security, threat and patient privacy' and the 'risk mitigation' strategy within our products and solutions we offer. 'Prevention is better than cure' and history is the witness that no legislation has succeeded in totally eliminating security breaches from the globe. The only possible step is to adopt tight security implementation mechanisms and effective risk control measures in parallel to enhancing the privacy policies to combat the security attacks. In this paper we will see certain healthcare security lapses and what it means to stakeholders in the healthcare industry and an attempt to discuss few proven operational strategies, risk management methodologies and discern what the industry can do mitigate such security risks and privacy threats.},

year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={99-104},
abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},

pages={171-176},
abstract={For the convenience of users, thousands of wearable devices with new built-in applications are appearing every year in the field of healthcare, sports, and safety. However, the system of them should be operated by using limited capacity of power because of very small size of battery that can be loaded into a wearable device due to the device properties. For such a reason, Chip Vendors are recently launching MCUs with ultra-low power capability on the market and also MCU that supports 7-step low power mode was appeared at present[1-3]. But now, it is very rare case to completely use Low Power Mode offered by MCU vendor on the operating system (OS) that is applied to wearable devices, and there is no case to support low power mode by the OS at the board level. Therefore, this paper suggests optimal supporting mechanism for ultra-low power multi-step mode at the OS level of wearable device. The mechanism proposed in this paper is largely divided into two parts. First, it is Low Power Mode Governor (LPMG) which is a module used to select an optimal low power mode after computation of retention time in idle mode. Second, we proposed Power-Off Mode, which disconnects power to the board when idle mode lasts for a long time. When integrating these two technologies and applying them to the Tickless nanoQplus[4], the OS for wearable devices developed at our lab, in the same Wearable Application Scenario 2 test, power consumption after passing a certain duration of time is reduced by 98.05% compared to idle mode, and 96.33% compared to sleep mode. These newly proposed two technologies will be able to offer an effective solution required to achieve low power consumption in wearable devices.},

Thus, a smartphone based falling detection system, SmartFDS is proposed in this paper, which can recognize the associated individual's falling behavior and send out an emergent message containing the location for immediate help. Generally, SmartFDS includes offline training phase and online activity recognition phase. Specifically, in training phase, utilizing the embedded accelerometer sensor, falling data for various situations are collected to extract the desired features that can appropriately characterize the falling behavior. Considering that the raw data are intrinsically prone to noise and error, those data are preprocessed by weighted smoothing. Then, 6 time-domain features are elaborated to determine the discriminative features for characterizing falling, and two features, maximum and vertical velocity are selected. Then, 4 different classification algorithms are investigated, and SVM is selected. The prototype of SmartFDS is implemented on Android phones, and can detect falling in real time accurately.},

The irrigation of agriculture field is carried out using automatic drip irrigation, which operates according to the soil moisture threshold set accordingly so as optimal amount of water is applied to the plants. Based on data from soil health card, proper amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other minerals can be applied by using drip fertigation techniques. Proper water management tanks are constructed and they are filled with water after measuring the current water level using an ultrasonic sensor. Plants are also provided the requisite wavelength light during the night using growing lights. Temperature and air humidity are controlled by humidity and temperature sensors and a fogger is used to control the same. A tube well is controlled using GSM [3] module (missed call or sms). Bee-hive boxes are deployed for pollination and boxes are monitored using ultrasonic sensors to measure honey and send mails to the buyers when they are filled. Further, the readings collected from storage containers are uploaded to cloud service (Google drive) and can be forwarded to an e-commerce company.},

abstract={The state-of-the-art electronics technology has been an integral part of modern advances. The prevalent rise of the mobile device and computational technology in the age of information technology offers exciting applications that are attributed to sophisticated, enormously reliable, and most mature CMOS-based electronics. We are accustomed to high performance, cost-effective, multifunctional, and energy-efficient scaled electronics. However, they are rigid, bulky, and brittle. The convolution of flexibility and stretchability in electronics for emerging Internet of Everything application can unleash smart application horizon in unexplored areas, such as robotics, healthcare, smart cities, transport, and entertainment systems. While flexible and stretchable device themes are being remarkably chased, the realization of the fully compliant electronic system is unaddressed. Integration of data processing, storage, communication, and energy management devices complements a compliant system. Here, a comprehensive review is presented on necessity and design criteria for freeform (physically flexible and stretchable) compliant high-performance CMOS electronic systems.},

abstract={There is a rapid growth in wireless communication devices, such as Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN). While WSN has the abilities of sensing, processing and communication over distances, its abilities are limited by the capacity of its battery. To use the full functionalities of WSN, either the battery needs to replace or recharge in a periodically manner. However both solutions are not convenient for livestock monitoring system. The only way to solve the issue effectively and efficiently is to recharge the battery wirelessly. Due to the harsh operating environment, the sensor node has to be waterproofed within a sealed enclosure which then brings up a mind-boggling challenge of how to charge a battery when it is concealed? Therefore, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) solution seems to be a sole solution to solve the issue in WSN for livestock farming. In this work, we propose a WSN livestock health monitoring system using Near Field Communication (NFC) to monitoring key parameters like temperature to monitor the health of livestock. WPT will also be discussed as how it provides a means for electronic devices to obtain power wirelessly without any physical connectivity to the WSN which is attached to the herds for health monitoring purpose.},

abstract={Decades old sensor technology for monitoring the structural health of a building can serve a new role as a novel source of indoor localization data. Specifically, when a person's footstep-generated floor vibrations can be detected and located then it is possible to locate persons moving within a building. This emergent cyber-physical system holds the potential for an ambient localization service. This service would enable indoor localization without needing the building occupants to carry a device that enables localization as required by some wireless localization technologies. Vibration propagation in buildings has complexities not encountered by acoustic or radio wave propagation in air. Thus, conventional localization algorithms do not address the technical challenges of this application. This paper identifies different aspects of propagation relevant to the task of footstep localization and adapts techniques from seismology and signal processing to formulate a localization strategy. Experiments conducted in an instrumented, public building validate the proposed approach. Footstep localization to sub-meter accuracy appears feasible.},

abstract={Physical indicators are directly related with health and fitness of human body. By employing real-time e-health monitoring systems for acquiring, and analyzing bio-signals by measurements such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), it is possible to extract information to achieve better health-care in terms of observation, diagnosis, and treatment. However, those systems are limited in acquiring and sending data at high rates, are not energy efficient, or, are restricted in terms of portability due to large size and weight. In this paper, a compact portable bio-signal acquisition device for wearables has been designed and implemented. The developed hardware is capable of acquiring and reliably sending the data wirelessly at a high transfer rate in real-time while keeping the overall energy consumption low. Finally, the signal acquisition performance of the device has been evaluated for both ECG and EMG at 8 channel 24 bit resolution/channel 500 samples/s configuration. Measurement of energy consumption has been conducted using professional tool and it is found that the device can continuously work for up to 13.6 hours with a 3.7V 1700 mAh battery. In addition, the device has been used in an IoT-based system as an example of possible integration.},

In our historically seen, the concept has been undergoing as “high-end technologies automatically shift to low-end ones”. So we want to know what the blind out. In my experiences, some of specific examples show by that could reveal the blinds and get the evidence. The most important element on their thought is communication bandwidth that is directly affected the data processing performance and communicating each other. The way for getting wider bandwidth involves three approaches which are high speed clocking, many lanes and high data compression. The first two issues relate with packaging technology which would be presented some. We additionally consider data compression technology. The system performance balance should put together the three issues. Let's focus in the three issues now. While power saving is another one of the most important things in not only DC's but mobiles. Higher bandwidth introduces saving power that we should know. Architecture of data processing with low power is managed by packaging issues which focus in also. If you well done of it, the world's highest-volume IoT platforms, the largest commercial health data clouds, the largest commercial video platforms and so on even in mobile fields could be taken as far as technological basis.},

Real time monitoring for analyzing vital signs to early detect or predict life threatening adverse events and frequent checks if the prescribed medicine is taken in time or not is required. In the existing system there is a need of another person for monitoring the patient condition. The proposed system eliminates the need of such manual observation of the patient. This system mainly consists of three components iMed box, iMed pack, Bio_patch which plays an important role. The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position. GSM is used to send and receive the information from the Doctor. Implementaton of this system will monitor the patient condition regularly and thus reduces sudden deaths.},

abstract={A significant number of promising wireless sensor applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming a reality. Most of these applications require a variety of heterogeneous and geographical sensor data to be delivered to users such as mobile devices, vehicles, and cloud systems for big data analysis to extract maximum value from the physical world. Data caching of popular data items in a network can significantly improve efficiency and reliability of content delivery by contributing the reduction of data access delay, bandwidth usage, and packet losses in resource-limited low-rate wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient cache placement protocol (BCDA) that minimizes data access cost and guarantees cache consistency in a lightweight manner. The BCDA decides where to store a copy of data content in a network using a distributed approach according to clients' access patterns, memory capacity, data size, and so on. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness, we implemented the BCDA in ns-2 and compared its performance with existing caching strategies. The simulation results highlight that the BCDA significantly reduces data access cost with minimizing cache management cost.},

abstract={Waste management has become a major issue in all the part of the world and tends to grow day by day. Mismanagement in waste has become one of the key environmental and health issue. With the increase of population, especially in the urban areas waste collection, categorization, and disposal has become a major hazard for the government authorities. An IoT based waste collection framework is proposed to automate the solid waste identification, localization and collection process. The authors are involved in the identifying key impact factors in the waste collection process and provide systematic and automated solution to optimize the process to achieve higher efficiency. A layered architecture is introduced to handle the waste collection process and an optimization algorithm is derived for the existing business process based on the proposed evaluation criteria. The final outcome is a complete framework which compromises the Inputs, Outputs, Guide and Enables. The main objective is to implement an optimized automated waste collection system with the use of a vast sensor network capable of gathering waste data and by implementing an optimization algorithm in waste collection.},

abstract={The advancement of new technologies provides not only better understanding of health but also ways to encourage it. For example, IoT in health domain comes a long way than just helping individuals regulate their body. It has enabled many social functions that connect users to serve more health related purposes. However, in Indonesia, as such an idea is still novel, there is a need to examine how is it being represented in health context to increase health capabilities. We asked 241 college students across Greater Jakarta (17-25 years old; Mean of age = 20.47 years old; Standard deviation of age = 1.469 years; 83 males, 158 females) 10 questions to measure their Social Representation towards IoT in the health domain. This is a descriptive research, and the instrument for data collecting is a questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed using Voyant tool to generate words cirrus for every answer. The result showed that although participants generally perceive that IoT in health domain is potentially beneficial and can be used to increase health capabilities, there are a few practical agency freedom limitations, such as individual dispositions and economic status.},

abstract={Various global development opportunities have been escalated through the Internet of Everything (IoE) with the potential of progressing Sustainable Development goals - dramatically accelerating and improving lives of millions. The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people. The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The succe- sful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures. A review of the Internet of Everything (IoE) is represented beneath, along with a brief portrayal of the applications and difficulties confronted by the (IoE).},

abstract={With the more and more serious population aging problem, the demand of long-term care is increasing. Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly. Our real prototyping experience and some experimental results are also reported.},

abstract={Rehabilitation and elderly monitoring for active aging can benefit from Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities in particular for in-home treatments. In this paper, we consider two functions useful for such treatments: 1) activity recognition (AR) and 2) movement recognition (MR). The former is aimed at detecting if a patient is idle, still, walking, running, going up/down the stairs, or cycling; the latter individuates specific movements often required for physical rehabilitation, such as arm circles, arm presses, arm twist, curls, seaweed, and shoulder rolls. Smartphones are the reference platforms being equipped with an accelerometer sensor and elements of the IoT. The work surveys and compares accelerometer signals classification methods to enable IoT for the aforementioned functions. The considered methods are support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and dynamic time warping. A comparison of the methods has been proposed to highlight their performance: all the techniques have good recognition accuracies and, among them, the SVM-based approaches show an accuracy above 90% in the case of AR and above 99% in the case of MR.},

abstract={Diabetes is an incurable disease where the body is not able to maintain the blood sugar level as the glucose in the blood is not utilize due to the destruction of the beta pancreatic cell of the liver. Blood sugar level of body is a very important factor for health and it should be maintain within the desired level or else this would result in complications and often serious damage to the body. Therefore treatment must be provided in case of high or low blood sugar level. In case of high blood sugar level, insulin must be injected and in case of low blood sugar level we should inject glucagon into the body. This paper is concerned on advanced method of simulation that can be used to implement a real insulin and glucagon pump that can work in real time to prevent the fatal effects of diabetes on body. This system also covers all the safety critical system aspect required to build a system that has a direct effect on human life. To provide better insulin and glucagon management and to reduce the need for human supervision, we have implement a control algorithm for the insulin and glucagon pump to automate the delivery process. The control algorithm adapts the glucose metabolic rate and determine the appropriate amount of insulin or glucagon to be delivered into the body. Method that is followed is effective and efficient in maintaining the blood sugar level. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system is very easy and user friendly that makes it easier for the patient and doctor to use. Different sets of testing were used to insure the safety and efficiency of the insulin pump simulation.},

abstract={This paper presents the time hopping (TH) visible light communication (VLC) system for an electromagnetic wave free indoor healthcare. VLC technology has emerged as an alternative wireless communication due to various advantages such as ubiquity, low energy consumption, no radio frequency (RF) radiation, and security against undesired network access. Significant bio-medical signal including the electrocardiography (ECG) can be transferred with VLC even in places where RF is forbidden. This potential advantage of VLC could save more emergency patients. The time hopping scheme is adopted to transmit multiple medical data with keeping a simple system design. Multiple data streams go through an optical detector including a photodiode and multiple data are separated by TH demodulator at the receiver. Each separated signal is then monitored to serve the necessary medical care for the concerned patient.},

However, typical networking solutions based on unicast/IP multicast are limited, in terms of performance and scalability, to Smart Surveillance in large-scale IoMT environments. We address these limitations by proposing SCORPIO, an SDN COntRol Plane which provides efficient multipart multimedia data sessions for Smart Surveillance applications in the Future Internet. SCORPIO exploits OpenFlow to dynamically map a multipart session into a group-based dataplane path for content exchange between multiple interested applications and groups of IoMT devices. Evaluations of SCORPIO in scenarios with Smart Surveillance traffic show its superior throughput, and lower packet loss and delay.},

However, in IoT/M2M many things only exchange a small amount of data while generate a large amount of requests such as network connectivity requests, notification requests and storage requests. The traditional charging models such as those based on amount of data transfer are no longer adequate for M2M communications.

However, according to statistics reports, annual global mortality for cardiovascular diseases remained as high as 29%, of which coronary artery disease (CAD) is accounted for 42%. Unfortunately, almost half of the patients not knowing they are at risk of cardiovascular diseases until serious symptoms occurred. Here, we proposed an early warning system by integrating IoT, big data, and cloud computing technologies which physically linked among personal communication devices of patient/doctor, cloud systems, and hospital medical information systems. The system collects personal heart rate and metabolic equivalent (MET) features from calibrated fitness devices wore by users, and corresponding fitted curves are dynamically calculated and compared to previously trained curve patterns from 213 patients with heart diseases and 124 healthy individuals. The prototype system was already successfully developed and validated by a couple of testing cases with excellent performance.

abstract={In this article we present the experimental results of an innovation-driven collaborative project in the eHealth domain that aims to create a product for the remote monitoring of elderly people in their own homes or inside proper care-homes or hospitals. In particular, we focus on how we solved the challenges of integrating a number of components into an architecture for an overall IoT platform that i. remotely monitors elderly people through heterogeneous wearable and positioning technologies; ii. processes produced data to generate alarms; iii. delivers, through an IoT broker, data-streams with fine-grained access control; iv. displays data to their owners and allowed contacts / doctors through simple web-based applications. These integration results, driven by concrete requirements, are about to be applied in 13 different trials across Europe. We illustrate lessons learnt in the implementation of an interoperable IoT data broker and a set of pragmatic choices made in the integration of newly designed and existing services (components in the afore-mentioned architecture). The contents of this article, rather than illustrating a scientific breakthrough, advance the state-of-the-art by providing a reference guide for a scalable API-based solution-design that lowers the IoT interoperability barriers and addresses secure and privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive data.},

title={IOT based smart garbage alert system using Arduino UNO},
year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1028-1034},
abstract={Waste management is one of the primary problem that the world faces irrespective of the case of developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor & ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management. This paper proposes a smart alert system for garbage clearance by giving an alert signal to the municipal web server for instant cleaning of dustbin with proper verification based on level of garbage filling. This process is aided by the ultrasonic sensor which is interfaced with Arduino UNO to check the level of garbage filled in the dustbin and sends the alert to the municipal web server once if garbage is filled. After cleaning the dustbin, the driver confirms the task of emptying the garbage with the aid of RFID Tag. RFID is a computing technology that is used for verification process and in addition, it also enhances the smart garbage alert system by providing automatic identification of garbage filled in the dustbin and sends the status of clean-up to the server affirming that the work is done. The whole process is upheld by an embedded module integrated with RF ID and IOT Facilitation. The real time status of how waste collection is being done could be monitored and followed up by the municipality authority with the aid of this system. In addition to this the necessary remedial / alternate measures could be adapted. An Android application is developed and linked to a web server to intimate the alerts from the microcontroller to the urban office and to perform the remote monitoring of the cleaning- process, done by the workers, thereby reducing the manual process of monitoring and verification. The notifications are sent to the Android application using Wi-Fi module.},

Population growth, industrialization, and climate change pose significant threats, necessitating on real-time monitoring of water resources. Recent developments in wireless sensor networks have made such monitoring possible, but the networks pose numerous challenges when deployed heterogenously at watershed scales. We present the detailed architecture of Savannah River Macroscope, an end-to-end ecological monitoring system designed to support large scale research and management of water resources. The system architecture spans four layers: (i) a custom wireless sensing platform; (ii) a multi-tier sensing fabric based on WiFi, cellular, and mesh-networking technologies; (iii) real-time streaming middleware for the processing, annotation, and archival of sensor data; and (iv) front-end applications for the management and visualization of sensor observations and system health information. Unique among existing implementations is the emphasis on data semantics and system configurability. In this paper, we describe how the system meets the challenges of large-scale hydrological sensing, detail the system architecture, and evaluate its performance with respect to current deployments.},

abstract={The privacy in eHealth is a serious issue that requires special considerations due to the sensitivity and importance of the shared patient's information. In the literature, several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed, most of them have focused only in content-oriented privacy, omitting the contextual privacy aspects. To cope with this deficiency, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme adapted to eHealth systems considering a normal and an emergency health scenarios. Our proposed scheme satisfies both content and contextual privacy requirements, as well as secure communications and quality of service (QoS). To do, we used an identity-based encryption scheme, a set of privacy mechanisms, and a prioritized queuing model. Moreover, we established a performance evaluation to study the queuing behavior of the proposed system. Extensive security analysis shows the robustness of our scheme. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed solution provides the first solution ensuring security as well as perfect privacy without neglecting any requirement.},

The aim of this system is to provide effective assistance for the elderly and people with disabilities. The work explores the integration of the Internet of Things, such as multimedia, wireless Internet communication, and automation control techniques into a powered wheelchair system. In particular, multiple videos are streamed in real-time from an array of cameras mounted on the wheelchair, allowing wide visualization surrounding the wheelchair. By using video communication and interaction, remote users can assist to navigate a wheelchair via the Internet through wireless connections in a distant location. The experimental results show that video streaming can achieve high-quality video with the streaming rate up to 30 frames per second (fps) in real-time. The average round-trip time is under 27 milliseconds (ms).

Thus, in this, paper, the author proposes a framework for their care based on the changes in the electric power production capacity and demands. The proposed framework is constructed on the basis of author's preceding studies [1-6] and combines IoT technology with the power line communication networks. The framework was constructed based on the scenarios which were created on the 3 layers among the 7-layers of OSI and then, a test bed was created to check the performance. The study showed that this expandable framework was successful in its design and implementation. In addition, the test bed experiment confirmed that the elements in the framework worked flexibly. Previous partial research findings in the preceding studies [1-6] were published in both domestic and foreign conferences or journals, where the feasibility of each research was proven. The author proposes this framework by integrating all the results from the previous studies and describes the designs and implementations for the respective parts in the actual test product.},

abstract={Pervasive Computing also called as ubiquitous computing where computing is made available to anytime and anywhere. It is very fast growing innovative trends in the field of Internet of Thing (IOT). Context Awareness is key part of pervasive computing. Context aware computing it means act of both sensing data from sensor and react according to sensory data. Context is nothing but information about any entity. For representation of Context Awareness there is need of setting up context. For setting up or defining context there is need of different parameters. Based on that parameters context is defined. Proposed system is all about context aware middleware for Human Activity Recognition. The main idea of activity recognition is to recognize day to day common human activities in real life. As human activities are complex and highly diverse activity recognition is challenging task. Activity recognition means to analysis of human body activity. Those activities are recognized by different recognition techniques. Several algorithms based on probability distribution have been used for building activity model. Activity recognition is an important paradigm in ubiquitous computing whereas it can be applicable for real time healthcare system also.},

abstract={Fog computing brings cloud closer to end-users and data sources by enabling computation at the edge of the network. Low latency is the main benefit. IoT applications are often latency-sensitive. Such applications may be provisioned as component-based in a hybrid cloud/fog environment with components spanning cloud and fog. This will enable placing some of its components in the fog domain closer to the IoT devices, and consequently reduce the latency. However, provisioning applications in hybrid cloud/fog environment is still manual today. Existing PaaS do not support interacting with fog nodes, at the edge, for applications' components provisioning. This demo shows the key features of the hybrid Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) we have designed for IoT applications provisioning in cloud and fog environments. Three goals are assigned to the demo: (1) How applications can be designed and developed in such environments, (2) how the hybrid PaaS deploys the applications' components across cloud and fog nodes, and (3) how it executes and manages them using appropriate orchestration techniques.},

abstract={Cloud computing has been lately extended by fog computing. The main aim of fog computing is to shift computing resources to the edge of the network, hence generating proximate rich infrastructures highly matching common latency and privacy requirements for IoT services. Recently, fog computing and cloud computing have been merged in a collaborative computing model referred to as Fog-to-Cloud computing (F2C). F2C's aim is to make the most out of the set of distributed and heterogeneous resources found at fog and cloud premises, hence building a global stack of resources, offered for an optimized service performance. The F2C paradigm is then based on providing services with those resources best matching their demands. In this paper, we illustrate how F2C may be used for a particular ehealth scenario with specific constraints in mobility, also including future research lines in the area.},

The complementary nature of the IoT and the could in terms of storage, processing, accessibility, security, service sharing, and components makes the convergence suitable for many applications. The advancement of mobile technologies adds a degree of flexibility to this solution.

abstract={We propose here the design and concept of self-powered wireless sensor based on the graphene radio-frequency (RF) components, which are transparent, flexible, and monolithically integrated on biocompatible soft substrate. This all-graphene wireless sensor consists of an optically transparent graphene antenna, which receives the fundamental tone and retransmits the sensed signal at its second harmonic, thus allowing low-noise sensing in a severe interference/clutter background. We show that a quad-ring circuit based on graphene transistors may simultaneously offer sensing and frequency modulation functions, with the nonlinear conversion gain being chemically sensitive to the gas/molecular/chemical exposures and agents. This battery-free and transparent sensors based on newly discovered 2D nanomaterials may benefit versatile wireless sensing and internet-of-things applications, such as smart contact lenses/glasses and microscope slides.},

abstract={A progressive advancement in biosensors and wireless technology are the major contributors to the realization of continuous remote health monitoring system (RHMS). Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is part of this technology due to the deployment of multiple sensors such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) to collect vital body signals for processing and diagnosis. Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data. Generally, the presence of these problems in transmitting vital body signals may result in incorrect medical diagnosing which can increase mortality rate and cause severe impact to the overall system's performance. Thus, a suitable design of congestion control mechanism is urgently needed in designing a reliable and efficient remote health monitoring system.},

Through this approach, they aim to lower the capture burdens, collect data that is typically hard to track automatically, and promote awareness to help people achieve their self-monitoring goals. They first specify three design considerations for semi-automated tracking: data capture feasibility, the purpose of self-monitoring, and the motivation level. They then provide examples of semi-automated tracking applications in the domains of sleep, mood, and food tracking to demonstrate strategies they developed to find the right balance between manual tracking and automated tracking, combining each of their benefits while minimizing their associated limitations.},

abstract={Emerging telemedicine frameworks with dynamically adaptive content management systems deliver the proper information at the time and place, when and where it is needed. Aggregated telemedicine sensory data is customized and dynamically presented to the suitable recipient. Such systems and methods have already been in some way available for scientific and industrial application. This presented paper extends the underlying adaptive eHealth content management methodology to the coherent structural implementation of weighted majority voting algorithm. This cognitive human-machine interaction drives the targeted dynamically adaptive eHealth content management system in runtime mode. Telemedicine embraces information technology and telecommunication solutions for the sake of serving healthcare services at remote locations outside of the premises of classical medical institutions. These systems produce and process exponentially growing amount of sensory data. Moreover, they support real-time processing which requires a dynamically scalable and fault tolerant architecture. Utilizing cognitive services, the suitable methods determine the adequate system landscape delivering the suitable medical information from the collected body-sensory data. The underlying methodology utilizes correlation-data between different factors, thus invoking eHealth customizable cognitive content management system. The paper also demonstrates the corresponding sociotechnical environment, the applied cognitive infocommunicational methodologies and the related adaptive technological elements. Finally, the future improvement potential and also the challenges of the presented dynamically adaptive eHealth content management system are analyzed in the paper thoroughly.},

abstract={Healthy environment is imperative to a healthy and happy community. With the age old system of hiring people to regularly check and empty filled dustbins, the process has been prone to human error and neglect. Additionally, due to different frequency of usage of dustbins in different areas, routine checks which are based on time crevices is inefficient because a dustbin might get filled early and may need immediate attention or there might not be any need of a routine check for a long period of time. This makes present system resource expensive and ineffectual, as overflowing, stinking dustbins become more of a problem than a solution. In this paper we present a solution about the SmartBin is a network of dustbins which integrates the idea of IoT with Wireless Sensor Networks. We also put forward the concept of a network of smart garbage bins based on the Stack Based Front End approach of integrating Wireless Sensor Network with the Cloud computing and discuss how Machine Learning techniques like Decision Forest Regression can be applied to the sensor data leveraged by the system to gain useful insights to improve the efficiency of the garbage monitoring.},

abstract={In the last few years the process of monitoring people health status has grown in interest in the researcher community and led to the develop of new devices able to detect and analyse information gathered from many kind of sensors. These devices are commonly designed to monitor or diagnose disease in the medical field. Moreover, a remarkable interest is growing in the field of sports. In amateur activities such as jogging, running, climbing a set of smart devices are used to improve and monitor performances. Another field of interest is represented by those people that wants to monitor their health status by using low cost devices. In this work we propose a two stage fuzzy logic approach in which the device tries to learn and fit customer habits in order to discover outlier warning signals. The two stages approach proposed consists of monitoring the normal activities of the user in order to build a reference of its condition; Then a real-time monitoring and analysis of gathered data from body sensors is accomplished. User status is carried out using a Fuzzy Logic based network. First stage will give us the current activity of the user while second stage will provide information about health status in terms of heart rate.},

abstract={With the uprising trend of the integration of wireless sensing systems in fields such as health care and industrial processes, where information exchange between power-limited devices is required, lower energy consumption and Quality of Service demands are becoming more stringent. Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising technology that provides, besides ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units. However, apart from power efficiency, opportune and reliable information delivery is mandatory in time-critical applications. In this paper we propose an analytical model of the delay performance of Bluetooth Low Energy for connection-oriented applications under different bit error conditions. In addition to the physical over-the-air latency, we also analyze the effect of the occurrence time of an Application Layer event on the effective transmission delay. We highlight the impact of the device's processing speed and the timing configuration of the connection on the final measured latency. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the model for all the analyzed cases.},

abstract={In recent years, people with lifestyle-related diseases are increasing, because of lack of exercise, overeating, stress and smoking. With this situation, applications of Personal Computer (PC) or smart phone which support healthy life are widespread. Turning to the system dealing with meal information, there are two type systems. One is that meal records are inputted by hand and managed as meal logs. Another one is that a meal image is shot by a smart phone, and meal contents are recorded by image recognition. However, these systems need a lot of time for inputting of meal contents or shooting of meal images. Therefore, it is difficult to continue use. Moreover, the second system has a problem for accuracy of image recognition. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a meal information collection system which uses IoT wireless tags. An IoT wireless tag is corresponded to a meal and the system can automatically get meal information such as meal contents, meal sequence, meal time and so on. We implemented the meal information collection system which aims automatic collection and getting of various information which do not get at other systems. From the evaluation results of collection accuracy and comparison with conventional systems, we verified effectiveness of the proposed system.},

year={2017},
volume={64},
number={1},
pages={155-165},
abstract={Objective: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not only crucial in clinical practice, but also has a significant potential to enrich clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD con- ersion.},

abstract={The consumer wearable economy is a rapidly growing sector with an ever increasingly number of use cases mostly focused on the quantified self. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers for connected smartphone apps, wearables typically come equipped with a wide variety of different sensors such as accelerometers, pulsometors, and thermometers to capture data such as, respectively, the user's movements, heart-rate, and temperature. Once data is captured it is then typically wirelessly transmitted, using Bluetooth LE (low energy) to an awaiting smartphone. Since the data may be sensitive and/or personally identifiable, it is critical that this exchange and the pairing mechanisms used to set up the connection remain secure and resilient to eavesdropping attacks. This paper empirically evaluates the data exchange mechanisms of a variety of major commercial wearable products to determine if, and how well, the products live up to this security constraint. As part of this effort, the work also investigates the three different types of Bluetooth LE pairing strategies at a packet and protocol level. The results show presumably secure pairing strategies have glaring security vulnerabilities that affect all of the devices examined. In addition to this publication, efforts are underway to report these vulnerabilities to US-CERT.},

abstract={Over 125,000 Americans die annually from not taking medication properly. Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.},

abstract={Malfunctioning or stopping of IoT equipment caused by failure to apply the security module can be fatal enough to threaten people's lives. This study suggests a model to transmit and manage patients' health and medical information safely through authorization in the IoT environment. Different with preceding studies that focus on saving patient information on the servers or improving access control, the proposed model considers threats related to process of patent information with efficiency. This study introduces a model where patients authorize representatives, who will be authenticated by hospitals, to transfer information to other hospitals safely for security, practicality, and efficiency. Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository. The advantage of this model is that it does not allow staff members or hospitals to collect information without patient's consent and thus reduces the risk of leaking patients' sensitive personal information to other places as the Token Repository saves nothing but the Access Token.},

abstract={Various disruptive technologies have evolved a paradigm for setting up the Internet-of-Everything (IoE) and continuous evolution of technologies has demanded those devices to communicate and exchange information with each other. The marketing research company Gartner has surveyed and estimated that around 30 billion devices would be interconnected and exchanging information by 2020. The IoE is accompanied by several substantial opportunities in all fields of life, ranging from the energy sector to the healthcare industry. The trail of IoE development has opened new doors of attack vectors. The evolution in the plethora of ubiquitous devices has raised several insider threats, thus generating concerns of security and privacy within enterprises who have framed the use of smart devices through IoE. This paper discusses a different perspective of security and privacy issues in IoE by considering insiders bringing personal smart devices to use within the enterprise. The central theme of this research is to identify the challenges and explore the extent of security and privacy issues a global network of smart devices could exacerbate within the enterprise.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) system application for remote medical monitoring. The body pressure distribution is acquired through a pressure sensing mattress under the person's body, data is sent to a computer workstation for processing, and results are communicated for monitoring and diagnosis. The area of application of such system is large in the medical domain making the system convenient for clinical use such as in sleep studies, non or partial anesthetic surgical procedures, medical-imaging techniques, and other areas involving the determination of the body-posture on a mattress. In this vein, a novel method for human body posture recognition that consists in providing an optimal combination of signal acquisition, processing, and data storage to perform the recognition task in a quasi-real-time basis. A supervised learning approach was used to build a model using a robust synthetic data. The data has been generated beforehand, in a way to enhance and generalize the recognition capability while maintaining both geometrical and spatial performance. Low-cost and fast computation per sample processing along with autonomy, make the system suitable for long-term operation and IoT applications. The recognition results with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient κ = 0.866 was satisfactorily encouraging for further investigation in this field.},

abstract={The increasing pervasiveness of ICT and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) will allow the spread of the often time and safety-critical embedded Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). The new challenge will be to design, programme and implement highly distributed and connected digital technologies. These technologies will be embedded in a multitude of increasingly autonomous physical systems with various dynamics and satisfying multiple critical constraints including cost, security, safety, power efficiency, high performance, and size. This combination of various cyber-physical systems gives rise to emergent properties and unpredictable behaviours. In the future world of Cyber Physical Systems, a significant number of devices connected to the physical world will be able to exchange data with each other, access web services, and interact with people. Thanks to the development of the IoT and of high speed broadband, this embedded world will then meet the internet world and the physical world will meet the cyber world. The purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive view on Cyber-Physical Systems and Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) focusing on the convergence of these technologies and research thrusts that underpin “Smart Cities” and the Internet of Things concepts. Moreover as a practical example of CPS and BASN, a research project that aims at the development of a Smart and Safe Wearable System for Hand Pattern Recognition is presented. This project has been approved for funding by the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in the framework of the Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement between Italy and USA.},

These diseases which include various ailments in the form of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, mental health illness, cancers, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are the biggest challenge for India and these diseases are the main cause of hospitalization for elder people. People who have suffered from chronic diseases are needed to repeatedly monitor the vital signs periodically. The number of nurses in hospital is relative low compared to the number of patients in hospital, there may be a chance to miss to monitor any patient vital signs which may affect patient health. In this paper, real time monitoring vital signs of a patient is developed using wearable sensors. Without nurse help, patient know the vital signs from the sensors and the system stored the sensor value in the form of text document. By using data mining approaches, the system is trained for vital sign data. Patients give their text document to the system which in turn they know their health status without any nurse help. This system enables high risk patients to be timely checked and enhance the quality of a life of patients.},

abstract={The IoT is the next generation of innovation in the smart world, which has the potential to improve safety, security, and the quality of our daily lives through pervasive communication and computation. Currently, we have observed that a plethora of interconnected smartphones, devices, and sensors are deployed for providing personalized services (e.g., social media, smart home, health monitoring) at any time from anywhere. The personalized services offered by IoT, although enhancing the quality of our lives, have serious challenges of securing networks and data in transit, as every day a myriad of devices and services are connected to the IoT. However, existing security solutions, such as two-factor authentication based on passwords along with second-level protection may not be efficient and reliable for providing end-to-end secure communication solutions among different devices and services connected to the IoT. To this end, this article proposes an end-to-end secure IoT-based solution using biometrics and pairing-based cryptography. Because of the uniqueness of one's biometric traits (e.g., face, fingerprint, palm, iris, voice, heartbeat), a biometric-based security solution is less vulnerable to security breaches for IoT systems or infrastructure. We present a biometric- based IoT infrastructure comprising four layers, and for each layer, we discuss possible security challenges along with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we provide a case study of face-based biometric recognition, where sensors or smartphones capture a face image and securely transmit it to the IoT platform to provide end-to end security.},

abstract={In recent years, the growing demand of personal healthcare has attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure. Using the model, diseases are ranked according to the current symptoms and stored in the server. Information of diseases and appropriate treatment therapies is sent back to the patient as well as stored in a web portal for personal monitoring.},

abstract={This paper examines the contemporary issues of interoperability between the emerging telemedicine smart devices and classical, industrial telemedicine systems. The article also presents an overview of two health-related data exchange standards from the western hemisphere, and gives a review with requirement specification on telemedicine systems interoperability. The applied health data exchange standards have significant impact on the general and widely interpreted interoperability of Telemedicine Systems. Interoperability for Telemedicine Systems can bring unprecedented value both at personal and at community level. In the other hand, the ability of sharing medical data on a global basis significantly extends the potential means of worldwide epidemic control. International disease analysis and the resulting forecasting-capabilities supported by Telemedicine Systems Interoperability represents a significant milestone in the practical application of various ICT-solutions, like cloud architecture, telecommunication systems, smart-devices and smartphone apps. Legacy healthcare systems, smartphone apps, smart-devices and telemedicine instruments are sharing data continuously and some of them are interdependent on each other. However, there are still significant barriers blocking the flawless circulation of medical information among health-institutions and devices. This paper also intends to explore some barriers on telemedicine systems interoperability and presents recommendation for future enhancement on flawless telemedicine data exchange.},

abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},

abstract={Enhancements of mobile devices capabilities resulted in an increasing usage of them among people all over the world. These smart devices including the smart phones changed our life style forever, and they are considered by many people as an inseparable part of their daily activities. We are using these mobile devices to do many useful activities such as: stay in touch with others through audio and video calls, run health and GIS applications, and do online shopping. However, there are some weakness aspects of these devices that limit their functionality: short battery and small memory. Mobile Cloud Computing promises to overcome such mobile device's limitations. The large files can be stored at the cloud, and the execution of huge jobs will be done at cloud also, and the mobile device will receive the results only. In this paper, we will build a mobile cloud system (MCS) for university applications. The proposed system can perform different tasks based on the types of the sensors used (motion, fire, or health sensors). We will present the design of two main applications of the proposed MCS which are in fire detection and traffic management inside the university. The data collected by the sensors will be transferred and analyzed in MCS to extract the suitable decision.},

abstract={In the last years there has been a strong interest in the aggregated data extracted from social networks such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, whose contents provide streams of information about the users' behavior. Analyzing these large data sets reveals trends that can be utilized in various fields. An interesting field of application of these data is presented in this paper, which illustrates an approach to perform a psycholinguistic analysis of the Twitter contents written in Italian language by Italy residents. In this way the predisposition of the latter to mental disorders such as the depression can be in particular measured. Moreover, the results of this analysis can be then correlated with the conditions of the weather in order to understand whether the correlation between weather and health is a common cliché or it can be demonstrated in some way e.g. through a mathematical relationship.},

abstract={Planning the deployment of antennas in complex environments is a difficult task that requires the analysis of each specific scenario. In many cases, real measurements are taken so as to map signal strengths, interferences, and so on. However, taking real measurements is very time consuming and becomes impractical in complex, large scenarios. With the aim to avoid this burden, simulation techniques based on Ray Tracing, combining Geometric Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction, are used to predict waves' behaviour within a given environment. Those simulations depend on a number of parameters, namely angular resolution, number of rebounds, cells size, etc. By tuning these parameters, high-definition (HD) and low-definition (LD) results can be obtained. Although more practical than manual measurements, the computational cost of simulations in HD prevents their use in complex environments and their LD counterparts are applied. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) that allows the use of LD simulations (with low computational cost) by lessening their low quality problems. The proposed CF strategy exploits spacial constraints in 2D propagation planes to improve simulation results, which end up being very similar to those of HD, with a fraction of its computational cost.},

In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home.

abstract={As humans generally spend most of their time indoors, having good indoor air quality and its real time information is critical for maintaining human health and productivity. According to EPA, indoor air even in centrally air-conditioned buildings is several times more polluted than outdoor air, primarily due to change in occupancy pattern, poor, old or ill maintained ventilation systems, dust, and presence of volatile organic compounds. Hence, it is necessary for humans to pervasively and ubiquitously measure air quality information in real time, specially whose health is sensitive to poor indoor air. In this work, we propose a novel context aware Android smart phone based mobile adhoc sensing system that senses various data from indoor environment around the user and analyses it in real time, thereby helping to maintain good health and better work productivity.},

Recent advances and trends, such as sensor systems, IoT, cloud computing, and data analytics, are making possible to pervasively, efficiently, and effectively collect data. However for data to be used to their full power, data security and privacy are critical. Even though data security and privacy have been widely investigated over the past thirty years, today we face new difficult data security and privacy challenges. Some of those challenges arise from increasing privacy concerns with respect to the use of data and from the need of reconciling privacy with the use of data for security in applications such as homeland protection, counterterrorism, and health, food and water security. Other challenges arise because the deployments of new data collection and processing devices, such as those used in IoT systems, increase the data attack surface. In this paper, we discuss relevant concepts and approaches for data security and privacy, and identify research challenges that must be addressed by comprehensive solutions to data security and privacy.},

abstract={The recent advances in sensor/actuator and RFID technologies have spun out a new healthcare model enabling capture and dissemination of patient vital signs over the Internet for ubiquitous monitoring of these patients anytime and from anywhere. This provides new opportunities for enhancing healthcare through participatory consultation, medical diagnosis and many other novel healthcare services. Some of the advantages of this emerging technology referred to in this paper as “Cyber-healthcare” includes low acquisition cost, flexible deployment and improved accuracy resulting from replacing manual operations by fully digitized processes. It is expected that the emerging healthcare technology will change the way healthcare is delivered in both rural and urban settings of the developing world by building upon this technology to leapfrog from poorly prepared to medically equipped environments capable of tackling some of the most challenging medical issues of the developing world such as patients' vital signs capture, patient prioritization and preparedness to virus outbreaks such as Ebola. This paper proposes a Cyber-healthcare system as a first step towards the implementation of least cost digital health systems in the developing countries.

abstract={This paper examines techniques to embark upon the Quality of Service (QoS) issues in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) using the Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP) framework. The design of QoS in WBAN is a challenging task due to several reasons such as lossy channel, resource-constraint nodes and priority-based services. The QoS provisioning mechanisms mostly focus on the MAC layer and do not extend easily across all platforms. We propose to integrate the QoS design into the application layer using the standard CoAP framework. CoAP architecture is a platform independent standard intended to be used in simple electronics devices such as Internet of Things (IoT). We introduce three CoAP features such as Caching, Confirmability and Multicast addressing. We examine these options to deploy the QoS mechanism in the WBAN composed of sensors with heterogeneous priorities. The proposed solutions are universal and can be deployed on any sensor platform which supports the standard CoAP software protocol.},

Many issues are involved, including transportation, energy savings, disaster management, environmental protection, education, healthcare, and security. Currently, the government of Taiwan is cooperating with telephone companies and industries to implement the smart city program. Major telecommunication companies have actively responded to the government strategy and made it a principal of their business development. The program proposed by Chunghwa Telecom aims to assist central and local governments in achieving smart cities by the end of 2017. The program includes the "convenient city," "happy city," and "friendly city," initiatives, which comprise three programs and 12 subprograms.

abstract={Fog Computing recently came up as an extension of cloud computing to facilitate the development of IoT services with strong requirements in latency, security while minimizing the traffic load in the network. The stack of resources set by putting together fog and cloud premises has been recently coined as Fog-to-Cloud (F2C) computing, and has been positioned as an innovative computing paradigm best matching current and foreseen IoT services demands. This paper emphasizes the benefits F2C may bring to a particular health area, namely COPD, whose patients' quality of life intensely depends on the patients mobility. We argue that by enriching current breath assistance systems for COPD patients with F2C capacities, the patients may comfortably afford physical activities, therefore impacting on reducing not only patients deterioration but also the re-admission incidence rate IRR) with a clear impact on the health costs as well.},

abstract={Nowadays, Smart Cities are positioned as one of the most challenging and important research topics, highlighting major changes in people's lifestyle. Technologies such as smart energy, smart transportation or smart health are being designed to improve citizen's quality of life. Smart Cities leverage the deployment of a network of devices - sensors and mobile devices-, all connected through different means and/or technologies, according to their network availability and capacities, setting a novel framework feeding end-users with an innovative set of smart services. Aligned to this objective, a typical Smart City architecture is organized into layers, including a sensing layer (generates data), a network layer (moves the data), a middleware layer (manages all collected data and makes it ready for usage) and an application layer (provides the smart services benefiting from this data). In this paper a real Smart City is analyzed, corresponding to the city of Barcelona, with special emphasis on the layers responsible for collecting the data generated by the deployed sensors. The amount of daily sensors data transmitted through the network has been estimated and a rough projection has been made assuming an exhaustive deployment that fully covers all city. Finally, we discuss some solutions to both reduce the data transmission and improve the data management.},

abstract={The use of mobile devices in healthcare offers various new possibilities and is spreading very fast due to this. However, the security aspects of mobile device use are often neglected. According to research, 44 percent of all data breaches happen in healthcare alone. Most of these breaches are directly related to mobile device use. In this paper, we conduct a literature review of mobile device security issues. We identified four pillars of information security in healthcare institutions: administrative measures, physical measures, data exchange with reliable institutions, and adapting of measures to changes. A key success factor in implementing information security is both awareness and training of healthcare workers, and commitment of healthcare institutions to ensure it.},

Such development represents an innovation in miniaturizing technological components to such a point where they can be used as accessories we use in everyday life; meaning this, Wearable Technology consists in the incorporation of technological components in clothing accessories or objects we carry. This implies that Wearable Technology is a subarea of Internet of Things since it incorporates physical objects with sensors and software that allows them to exchange data without human intervention.

abstract={Being able to determine the location of a node is of great advantage in many IoT and WSN applications. For example, in health care scenarios or for autonomous configuration of IoT setups this information can be useful. One of the key challenges in localization is to estimate the distance between nodes. Most present indoor localization systems require additional hardware for this estimation which is costly in terms of money and energy consumption. To overcome this disadvantage, we developed a system which is able to perform distance measurements without adding any extra hardware and costs. It is based on phase measurements performed by the IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver chip that is normally solely used to realize communication. In the evaluation we investigate the performance of our system in different real world environments that are typical for IoT and WSN setups.},

abstract={In the new era of IoT, hundreds or even thousands of interconnected miniature sensors have made feasible the creation of novel applications spanning in multiple areas like e-health, environmental monitoring, on-farming, etc. Despite the technological advances in this domain, the sensors are still severe constrained devices, in terms of memory and processing. These limitations cannot only compromise applications' performance but can also affect trust and security in the IoT ecosystem. Besides security and trust, energy efficiency is also of paramount importance as sensors are often battery-operated. For energy minimisation and data security purposes, several contributions have mainly focused either on data compression, or data encryption; however, considering those as two independent operations. The last few years, the Compressive Sensing theory has shown that compression and encryption can be used simultaneously, given that data are sparse in some domain. As data sparsity cannot be known in advance, here, we present a practical implementation of a compressive sensing system where the data sparsity is estimated, and the compression rate is selected accordingly. Our system consists of two entities: a server implemented in Java running on a powerful machine, and a client that runs in a miniature sensor, developed in C and executing in the Contiki operating system. The evaluation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme against a non-adaptive one.},

The proposed work focuses on the development of a reliable and low-cost health monitoring system for automotive drivers. It is based on non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) principle. Multiple signal acquisition ECG electrodes are placed on the seat and seat-belt of the automotive. The signals from the different electrodes are interfaced to simple analog and digital signal processing units through a switching logic. The frequency domain-based digital processing and the switching logic ensures that best quality ECG signal is selected for heart rate (HR) estimation. A prototype of the proposed system is build and tested on several volunteers. These tests show that the accuracy is 2 bpm. Additional tests to determine the system performance in various conditions was conducted and results reported.},

Our research team suggested Smart Home solutions based on the user behavior analysis and modeling [3]. We also studied application of this approach to different householder needs (like healthcare or imitation of the user's presence [4]). We showed that the approach also critically improve the usability of the Smart Home. Finally, we described the methodology for analysis of the householder's behavior and simulation of his activities. So “offline” solutions based on this approach allows protecting privacy and provide good usability (“offline” means here partly or completely disconnected from the external operating signals and observations). At the same time they have some disadvantages including relatively low quality of predictions [5]. In this paper we discuss how the tuning of parameters of the previously suggested methodology provides improvement of the user needs predictions. The results of primal tests of this approach are presented and analyzed.},

abstract={Stable cloud services and global infocommunicational infrastructure capabilities are enabling for the first time in our history the worldwide interoperability of classical medical systems, telemedicine instruments, health-related smart devices and smartphone-apps. In this paper we present a unified service architecture with the corresponding common interface recommendation for integrating classical medical systems from the following areas: interconnection of telemedicine systems, hospital information systems, legacy health care systems, smart health devices and health-related smartphone-apps. Emerging IoT-technologies open new horizons also for medical care solutions. Stable cloud architecture technologies deliver the comprehensive back-end infrastructural basis for dealing efficiently with the foreseeable human medical data boom. Classical medical supply chains and institutions will establish and open IT-interconnection capabilities interacting with smart end-user devices. Collection, aggregation and evaluation of massive health-related data streams call for common architectural platform with unified interfaces. Telemedicine solutions with IoT connectivity handle massive number of active device connections and produce significant unstructured sensor data-flows. As different sensor data implies varying data transmission, processing and storage techniques, there is a remarkable demand for a general and common interface standard. This will enable the flawless interaction among classical legacy medical systems, industrial telemedicine devices, smart-devices and smartphone health-apps via both internet (LAN, WLAN, GSM, etc.) and peer-to-peer (Bluetooth, NFC, etc.) connections. Inevitably arise security and ethical considerations concerning access of sensitive medical data with regard to different domestic and regional regulations. Recent remarkable innovations, like direct Bluetooth LE internet browser support, highlights the further perspectives of the described commo- open telemedicine hub and infrastructure with the recommended interface hierarchy.},

This system aims to offer mobile support in order to facilitate faster and better medical interventions in emergency cases and has been developed using low-power dedicated sensor arrays for EKG, SpO2, temperature and movement. The interfaces for these sensors have been developed according to the IoT model: a central control unit exposes a RESTful based Web interface that ensures a platform agnostic behaviour and provides a flexible mechanism to integrate new components.},

abstract={The Alphasat satellite was launched on 25 July 2013. The Aldo Paraboni technology demonstration payload, funded by ASI under ESA's ARTES Programme, was embarked as an hosted payload on Alphasat. This Technology Demonstration Payload (identified as TDP5 and recently renamed “Aldo Paraboni”) was implemented under an ESA contract awarded in co-contractorship to Space Engineering and Thales Alenia Space Italia (TAS-I) which conceived the experimental mission and industrialised the subsystems. The Aldo mission is composed of two main elements: a Communication Experiment mission, which aims at assessing the performance of communication links at Q/V Bands; and a Scientific Experiment mission implemented through two beacons at Ka and Q Bands, which aims at characterizing propagation phenomena at these frequencies. During the In Orbit Test campaign of the above two mission components, TDP5 demonstrated compliance to the requirements and the nominal conditions of the Payload. The main topics of this paper are the description of the In Orbit Test requirements and the discussion of tests results. The good health of the Payload is demonstrated by the agreement of the results with the predictions that were calculated on the basis of the results of the on ground test campaign. The Commissioning and IOT campaign of Aldo Paraboni was performed over 3 distinct sessions: · Commissioning: 17-18 September 2013 · IOT Part 1: 10-18 October 2013 · IOT Part 2: 4-8 November 2013 This work is only related to the verification of the performance of the space segment, the Q/V-Band Payload, also referred to as the TDP5.

This paper presents a polymorphic, multi-behavioral MAC protocol called PEAM (Polymorphic, Energy-Aware MAC Protocol) designed to support WBANs used in ubiquitous healthcare monitoring systems. The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states. PEAM was designed based on cross-layer constructs that allow across the layers synchronization and coordination orchestrated by the application layer and targeting the Data link layer services. PEAM has also been enabled to interplay with IPv6 networks through interaction with the 6LowPAN middleware.

The measurements were conducted using the commercially available equipment in the main campus of the University of Oulu, Finland, which has an indoor area spanning for over 570 meters North to South and over 320 meters East to West. The measurements were executed for a sensor node operating close to human body that was periodically reporting the sensed data to a base station. The obtained results show that when using 14 dBm transmit power and the largest spreading factor of 12 for the 868 MHz ISM band, the whole campus area can be covered. Measured packet success delivery ratio was 96.7 % without acknowledgements and retransmissions.},

abstract={With the advancement of the IoT (internet of things) miniaturization of wireless devices is very important. These devices are communicating in different frequency bands. One way of saving space is the use of multiple band antennas. The design of multiple band antennas is a task of reverse engineering in which the resonances of the antenna structure are tuned to given center frequencies. In this presentation it is shown how SoS (Statistics on Structures) in combination with electromagnetic field simulation using ANSYS HFSS can be used to generate a field meta model of optimal prognosis for the frequency response of the return loss. This field meta model is used to optimize the antenna with no additional solver runs. Also, this procedure allows to re-define scalar optimization criteria, after the DOE (Design of Experiment) has been calculated, by extracting quantities like the position and width of minima from the field meta model for the full frequency response. This allows for a lot of flexibility during the process of optimization.},

abstract={The ageing population worldwide is constantly rising, both in urban and regional areas. There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario. Finally, we conducted a scalability analysis to determine the feasibility of deploying IReHMo in large numbers in regions of north Sweden.},

abstract={An exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.},

abstract={In recent years, human motion recognition based on smartphones has gotten increasing attention in many fields such as mobile health, health tracking and pervasive computing. However, motion recognition performance can be easily affected by variation of phone orientations and positions. Different users have influence on recognition accuracy as well. Most of existing work focuses on one or two respects of above problems, or train different models for different phone positions and orientations. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for human motion recognition based on smartphones, which can effectively discriminate six daily motions regardless of device positions and orientations. We select a set of more robust and effective features to solve performance degradation problem caused by different phone positions, phone orientations and users. In experiments, we access our method using the dataset collected by three volunteers on Android smartphones. The experimental results show that the proposed feature extraction algorithm is better than most existing algorithms.},

Finally, we have conducted a survey where we analyzed the user perspective of long term wearable device usage. We asked about 16 issues, organized in three categories: the practical daily use, data and measurement procedures, and user experience with the device and supporting software. Preliminary findings indicate that most of the issues are perceived as highly relevant or relevant for the users and that roughly half of them have already personally experienced these problems.

abstract={This paper presents a Multi-agent system that facilitates the remote monitoring of the elderly patients which are susceptible to mental disorder diseases. In order to find early signs of health condition depreciation we have assessed four of the most common mental disorder diseases to find which kind of sensors can detect specific symptoms with the main purpose of creating an early warning system. The diagnosis component is based on an ontology that defines the relations between sensors, symptoms and diseases. Based on these relationships a specialized agent can inform the medical personnel about the detected symptoms.},

abstract={Internet Of Things (IoT) is one of the major topics in computer science. The connection of IoT to applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is common in order to propose practical solutions. Simultaneously, games are known to increase interest and motivation among students when they are designed with pedagogic intent. Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them. But as our application gathers information that are relevant for remediation, it is also a forward useful solution to doctors who are always busy and who might check the display of children without an actual meeting.},

year={2015},

pages={13-13},
abstract={Summary form only given. Intel is focused on gaining a foothold in the burgeoning mobile/IOT computing market. One of the unique challenges in this dynamic market is the aggressive time-to-market (TTM) requirement. In the past, the length of the silicon validation stage for Intel SoCs contributed to the company's inability to deliver products on time, taking up to two years for prior projects. To address this situation, the Devices System Validation group set a transformation goal to reduce time from first silicon to PRQ for base and derivative products. While a validation execution strategy can be optimized based on perceived risk in changes to HW, FW, and SW, accounting for silicon debug is far more difficult. It is nearly impossible to predict the amount of time necessary to debug the breadth and quantity of issues (Sightings) that will be found during execution. The number of sightings generated over the course of a project depends on many factors, including the health of the RTL and process, the stability of the FW and SW code base, and the technical strength of the execution team. This unpredictability results in many challenges when attempting to hit a target time window from first silicon to Production Ready Quality (PRQ). Moorefield, a platform based on Intel's 22 nm Atom-based SoC named Anniedale, was the first project to achieve a goal of first silicon to Production in two quarters. A major factor in this achievement was the strategy employed by the team to manage the risk in silicon validation and debug with aggressive shift left effort that included early and close collaboration with the customer, platform, and design teams. This strategy is built on several key pillars. 1) Comprehensive Design for Debug (DFD) features and tools that are fully validation in pre-silicon & emulation to prepare for critical debug scenarios at customer platforms. 2) Early and close engagement with the lead customer and platform teams to develop an alpha level quality- SW in emulation. 3) Employing requirements-based validation to focus on validating only the form factor OS application use-cases. 4) A strict platform regressions strategy that can be scaled from pre to post silicon 5) Centralized System Debug organization to accelerate time to closure of critical sightings. In this talk we will be detailing and presenting the innovative strategies the System Validation (SV) organization took around the these pillars to achieve a successful launch of the Moorefield-based Asus tablet and phone in record breaking time.},

abstract={New data sources from sensor networks and Internet-of-Things applications promise a wealth of interaction data that can be naturally represented as time-varying networks. This brings forth new challenges for the identification and removal of time-varying graph anomalies that entail complex correlations of topological features and temporal activity patterns. Here we present an anomaly detection approach for temporal graph data, based on an iterative tensor decomposition and masking procedure. We test this approach using high-resolution social network data from wearable proximity sensors. The dataset includes metadata that allow to independently build a ground truth, used to validate the anomaly detection method. Our approach achieves high accuracy in identifying meso-scale network anomalies due to sensor wearing protocol, proving the practical viability of the method for a real-world application.},

abstract={Caused by the proliferation of the (IoT) and its related application domains such as Building Automation or E-Health, users face a continuously increasing amount of heterogeneous sensors and devices deployed to their environment. As a result, a large variety of protocols, data formats and physical sensing resources needs to be managed in order to gain benefit from the deployed devices. This raises the question how the resources provided by the devices can be efficiently managed and provisioned. Related concepts like on-demand provisioning, elasticity, or resource pooling and sharing are already known from the Cloud Computing domain. This paper presents the Device Cloud approach, which aims at mitigating the IoT resource management issues by applying Cloud Computing concepts to the IoT domain. Similar to the Pay-as-you-Go paradigm, the Device Cloud allows users to allocate devices from a shared resource pool on-demand. Sensors and devices are not just integrated with the Cloud by being enabled to utilize Cloud services. Instead, the physical (IoT) resources become an integral part of the Cloud resource pool and are shared and provisioned like regular Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud resources.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have been increasingly popular and they have been deployed in a wide range of areas including transportation system, healthcare, robotics, and smart home. Wireless sensor networks have facilitated our life using the remote sensing ability. However, these systems could be taken advantage by the malicious parties to mislead users since they are often not physically secured and are used in hostile environments. We have proposed theoretical and statistical framework for creating data integrity attacks and corresponding security defenses. The data integrity attack is defined as a type of attack that targets to mislead the system by altering some collected data of the system in such a way that to achieve the goal of attackers. We use the Intel lab sensor data and demonstrate that it is easy to attack only a few essential sensors values to change the behavior of system, such as the control of air conditioner. To be more specific, by changing the temperature and humidity data measured by a group of sensors, the attacker can control the air conditioner turning on and off without being detected by correlation check. On the top of data integrity attacks, we have further developed low overhead defense schemes.},

abstract={Cities increasingly face challenges related to pollution, efficient use of resources (e.g. water, energy) and ensuring a good quality of life for its citizens. Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives. A need for inter-continental automated testing facilities such as those developed by TRESCIMO is identified through which integrated experiments can be conducted to provide insight and answers.},

We use the wearable devices to collect the electrocardiography (ECG) and respiration (RESP) signals. This wearable device is a prototype with analog front-end, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth module. We attach the electrodes on the thorax to record single-lead ECG signal and thorax impedance variation of the users. The mobile phone is a platform for dealing with the digital signal processing. We design an Android app with convenient user interface for every application. With discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we can easily detect the important features such as P wave, QRS complex and T wave and reduce the interference of noise. We develop an application with the wearable device for the emotion recognition. The extracted-features of biomedical signals are implemented with methods by the cloud computing. We implement the cloud computing by Apache Storm, which can transmit the data by streaming via 3G/Wi-Fi. With the proposed stream processing framework for the relaxation state calculation with wearable ECG sensors, under 5 people monitoring simultaneously, the latency and response time can be reduced by 10 times.},

abstract={Diagnosis of breast cancer analysis disease becomes one of an open discussion and a crucial need in Egypt. The analysis of these datasets for patients is important for the early detection and prediction of the disease. The usage of case-based reasoning (CBR) systems and the machine learning techniques provides us with several techniques to easily decide whether the patient is healthy or not. In this paper, we proposed a case- based reasoner architecture that aid physicians to early detect and predict breast cancer disease. As a retrieval technique Rough Sets Theory (RST) is applied followed by two different classifiers to improve the classification accuracy of the medical data. Results yield to 96% accuracy for 103 out of 108 instances and 82% classification accuracy after the usage of two different classifiers other than the RST (Neuro-Fuzzy and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers).},

The limitation of sensor node is in terms of resources namely storage, power, processing potential and communication range. For the sensor network to be operational an efficient routing algorithm to forward the arriving packets is essential The data transferred by the nodes will be redundant in most of the scenarios. Selecting the optimal route for data transmission is one of the vital factors from the perspective view point of a routing protocol In order to eliminate the redundancy of data and to enhance the QoS parameters, Statistical Ad-hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (S-AODV) routing protocol is proposed in this paper. This new protocol is analyzed with respect to each layer by taking QoS metrics and statistical parameters in to consideration. A comparative study reveals that the proposed protocol performs better than the present AODV protocol.},

abstract={The high development of medicine causes the world's population aging quickly. To resolve the problem with limited medical resources, constant monitoring of elders' activity of daily living is important. We propose an activity recognition system for smart home, so elders can live alone and their children can monitor their parents' living activity to achieve the concept of "Aging in Place". The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past. We demonstrate the living activity monitoring model is feasible to be deployed in a living home with high accuracy performance of the activity recognition result.},

abstract={Diabetic ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},

IP mobility management in such networks playing a crucial role for object tracking or to provide uninterrupted services to mobile users. Existing MIPv6 and its extensions are not suitable for such lossy networks due to the MN's involvement in heavy signaling, required for HO. Network based protocol; PMIPv6 relieves the MN from heavy signaling overhead and being suggested by many researchers for lossy networks to carry out the mobility. But this protocol still suffers from extra signaling and packet loss and there is a scope for further improvements. This paper presents a novel approach based on PMIPv6 for reducing HO latency and packet loss for some critical applications such as Healthcare, battle field, disaster management, ITS etc. where packet loss is not acceptable. The performance analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is better than the standard PMIPv6.},

abstract={The knowledge and experiments' sharing can inculcate a healthy competitive environment in agriculture sector across the country. In this age of high usage of mobile devices by rural India the problem of absence of requisite extension services to farming community can easily be dealt by launching a two-way interactive value creating service through mobile devices. Agriculturists is India, by and large, are dispersed, unorganized, illiterate, deficient in resources and run a high risk of natural calamities, market uncertainties and price crashes. Pooling the traditional and scientific wealth of knowledge from across agricultural domains into a cloud based ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) will develope an e-agriculture Resource Planning platform for the empowerment of agricultural fraternity. The paper emphasizes the need of an externally hosted cloud computing platform to manage full utilization and application of appropriate knowledge and technology by the users across the country. The availability of ERP-cloud based integrated e-agricultural setup for accessing all types of desired information will benefit them with customised solutions across geographical locations. The study proposes an application for Usage and Execution Behaviour `UnEB' to facilitate the end users taking suitable steps timely to maximize their returns from agricultural and allied activities. The proposed application may be integrated with ERP-cloud to recommend quality decisions based on GIS (geographic information system), remote sensing using smartphones and feedback mechanism. The intended system may lead to improving the farming practices, overcoming the crises and developing an upgraded agricultural system for the country.},

This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task.

abstract={Blood is most essential constituent in human body. Blood centers collect, process and transport blood to hospitals and other health care centers. Sometimes blood is collected directly from blood donors rather than taking it from blood bank. Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases. The proposed system is a web based application which helps to reduce the human mistakes or errors and different techniques can be applied for blood type classification, diagnosing diabetic symptoms, classifying blood type and identifying different donors reaction and apply preventive measures against them.},

abstract={In recent decade, hospitals turns into smart hospitals by the advent of recently developed technologies around the world. The growth in technologies like networking and other provides a brighter future and open scenario to interconnect different equipment in the hospitals, which gives us a new field of research which is called nurse calling system. Also due to growth in the fields of communication which aids such facilities with the used to technology. And which indeed make feasible such type of systems in today's world. In a generalized methodology for implementing Nurse calling system make use of a trigger button facility attached to the patient's bed. When pressed by the patient, it alerts the center nurse station by giving out an audible tone or light flashes and requesting patient is severed accordingly by a nurse or other health care staff member. But in recent scenario nurse calling systems are improved and user friendly so they are in demand now. The proposed system is one step toward the remedy of such condition. Which enables the implementation of nurse calling system with more ease by the application of wired technology like RS-485, Modbus protocol, along with wireless technology of RF/ZigBee modules. This proposed nurse calling system is capable of operating large numbers of beds by means of RS-485 Protocols. So automatically controlling devices in a hospital is being feasible by such systems. This system is another step in technology by the technology for ease of a human being.},

We proposed this to implement anonymous light-weight authentication protocol through which a WBAN user can easily access the telemedicine system. Using WBAN services, the physicians receive the real-time information and updates of the patients. The Certificateless signature (CLS) scheme is probably used to uniquely meet the security demands in WBAN. With the help of CLS, the security is assigned by private keys given to the patient. Because of that it is impossible for the third party or the attacker to access the private information of particular session.},

year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-4},
abstract={This work proposes an ultralow power highly linear analog front-end (AFE) with an input dynamic range from 200μVpp to 20mVpp. The system consists of a signal conditioning instrumentation amplifier (IA), two programmable gain amplifiers (PGA), a mixed signal automatic gain control (AGC), two sample and hold (S/H), a 10 bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC), and a ΣΔ modulator with 10 bit effective number of bits (ENOB). A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32. The proposed system is intended to be powered by an energy scavenging circuit without compromising its own performance. The system was successfully tested for an ECG signal obtained from PTB database.},

abstract={The modelling of healthcare process is inherently complicated due to its multi-disciplinary character. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been considered and applied to model and demonstrate the flexibility and variability of the activities that involved in healthcare process. However, with the growing usage of digital information and IoT technology in the healthcare system, the issue of information security and privacy becomes the main concern in term of both store and management of electronic health record (EHR). Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place. BPMN is lacking of the ability to model and present security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a suitable way. This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult. In this paper we provide a solution to model the security concepts in BPMN by extending it with new designed security elements, which can be integrated with the BPMN diagram smoothly.},

abstract={Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.},

abstract={This paper presents a design of an indoor localization system that can be used in hospital nurse calling systems. The call button of patient is batteryless and wireless. The positioning system is developed for this batteryless button. When the switch is pressed, a wireless telegram is sent to reference nodes that act like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This wireless message contains the module ID and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value. The reference nodes or beacons forward the information gathered from target node to a central receiver attached to a computer. A program is developed to read the incoming signals to the receiver module for processing. This program calculate the distance between target node (unknown location) and each reference node (known location), and then it determines the position of the call button which held by the patient. In parallel, nurses hold smart phones, and the position is determined via WiFi-Based Positioning System (WPS). Both systems are combined and linked to the nurse calling system. Therefore, when a patient hits the batteryless button, the system will compare the patient position with nurses' positions and notify the nearest nurse. The main goal of developing such system is to decrease the time taking for the nurse to provide healthcare for patients.},

abstract={Cabled ocean observatories, which support continuously deployed underwater sensors, enable an increasing amount of near real-time, high resolution data to be collected from the marine environment. These data can be used in the design of intelligent systems to predict and measure properties of the marine environment. One environmental factor that is very important to maritime transportation and safety is sea state, that is, the "roughness" of the sea surface. Sea state is dependent on winds, but can vary significantly with location and over time, based on a wide range of factors. We show how publicly available sensor data can be used to detect and predict local sea state. To do this, we will discuss various techniques that can help us deal with a large set of echo sounder data, and aggregate it in a way that allows basic machine learning techniques to categorize the local sea state at a given time according to the Douglas Sea Scale.},

We propose a smart IoT-based holistic system that consists of a urine colour measurement component to be fitted in urinals. Based on RGB colour theory, the system was implemented using a myRio board, which interacts with a mobile application. Bio-samples (urine) gathered from volunteers were tested using this board and with a hand-held refractometer. The results showed that it is possible to infer the BHL by analysing the blue values of RGB colour and by comparison with the recommended urine colour chart. We believe that the proposed system promotes sustainable healthy lifestyle through its ubiquitous “on-the-go” self-test solution and raises BHL awareness in a “greener” and more “personal” way.},

abstract={The work described in this paper consists of a temperature tracking system that follows a Client-Server architecture. A Raspberry Pi, a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) device, is responsible for sensing the temperature and streaming it to a server, the readings then are displayed in a mobile android application. For this system, a python application was developed to sense and stream the temperature, a servlet was developed to read and store the temperature in a SQLite database, and a mobile Android application was developed to read and display the temperature readings from the server. The initial versions of the project used the SoC device as a server (storing temperature readings into a local SQLite database), and both the SoC device and the mobile device needed to be connected in a local area network. However, the project was further developed to separate the server responsibilities from the SoC device. The system now supports user authentication, and both devices are connected through the Internet. This implementation allows the temperature readings to be viewed and displayed anytime from anywhere in the world since the database is hosted on a server which can be accessed over the internet. Also, this solution allows multiple SoC devices to stream temperatures to the server, to different mobile clients using the same database. The Android client application was also implemented to graphically show the temperature readings recorded by Raspberry Pi using Restful architecture. Moreover, an alert message notification was implemented in Android application so that a user is notified whenever the temperature reading reaches the preset threshold. On the other hand, the smart chair system has brilliant commercial prospects, which can be helpful to build health care products with the help of wearable sensors, intelligent refrigerator/oven temperature tracking system and etc.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources. In this paper we report on developments made to-date in various technical areas with respect to critical issues such as cost, power consumption, scalability, interoperability and privacy.},

abstract={With the pervasiveness of smartphones and the advance of wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs), mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) has attracted considerable interest recently. In m-Healthcare, users' smartphones serve as bridges connecting their WBSNs and the healthcare center (HCC), i.e., send users' personal health information (PHI) collected by WBSNs to the HCC and receive the feedback. However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can realize privacy-preservation and achieve secure end-to-end communication for m-healthcare, and is suitable for resource-limited WBSNs.},

abstract={Digital information has become a social infrastructure and with the expansion of the Internet, network infrastructure has become an indispensable part of social life and industrial activity for mankind. The idea of using existing electronics in smart home appliances and connecting them to the Internet is a new dimension along which technologies continue to grow, and in recent years mankind has witnessed an upsurge of usage of devices such as smart phone, smart television, home health-care device, smart LED light bulbs system, etc. Their build-in internet-controlled function has made them quite attractive to many segments of consumers and smart phone has become a common gadget for social networking. There are, however, serious challenges which need to be addressed as these tiny devices are designed for specific functions and lack processing capacity required for most security software. This research explores how these internet-enabled smart devices can be turned into very dangerous spots for distributed attacks purposes by cybercriminals for various ill intensions in a pinpointed manner. It then introduces a new approach to deal with such problems by taking advantage of the anonymous communication of the Onion Router (hereafter: TOR). It compares pros and cons of using anonymous communication scheme and justifies it be an efficient countermeasure to most attack scenarios.},

abstract={The cost and effort for developing personal healthcare systems with IoT devices can be substantially high mainly due to complex inference capabilities. To tackle the problems, we proposed INFerence-as-a-Service (INFaaS) in our previous work. INFaaS is a cloud service which provides a core set of common functionality required to develop various context-aware applications. Since INFaaS is designed for generic purpose, its applicability and genericity should be verified in that sense. In this paper, we present a comprehensive case study of developing an IoT-based Personal Healthcare System with the INFaaS cloud framework. This system requires various inference algorithms to diagnose diseases with the acquired medical contexts, which will increase developers' overhead.

abstract={Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has led to a new paradigm of Internet of Everything (IoE). In case of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) that is based on the sensor network is usually deployed for single application. However, the future of WSNs based on sensors lies in the multiple application support and the aggregation of resources either in the form of hardware or software. To deal with the challenges of aggregation of sensors in the health care environment, virtualization of a sensor network is an evolving concept that enables aggregation of multiple independent heterogeneous sensor networks under one roof. In order to virtualize the sensors and networks, middleware layer role is the most dominant one. Furthermore, middleware for sensors poses the overhead challenges like processing time, memory utilization, sampling rate, delay, and power consumption. In this paper efforts have been put forward by proposing a middleware framework for sensor network that uses multi-threading technique that increases the sampling frequency and reduces the delay caused by the hardware abstraction layer that resides on top each sensor node. Mathematical model shows significant improvement in the processing time.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={In recent years monitoring of beehives through technology has become increasingly frequent in research and industry. This is due to a decline in beekeeping, and stagnant honey bee populations across the globe, due to, among other factors, pests and disease. Recent advances in the area of low power wireless sensor network technology can be applied to the beehive for a better understanding of the colony's condition. This combination of engineering and beekeeping has led to the emergence of Precision Beekeeping. One of the key metrics of the strength of a beehive is the weight of the colony. Changes in weight can accurately reflect the productivity of the colony, as well as its health and condition. This paper describes the development of a wireless platform weighing scales, for implementation as part of a smart beehive. A single point impact load cell was selected as the most appropriate load sensor and was integrated into the design of the scales. The final weighing system was interfaced via a high precision analogue to digital converter to an off-the-shelf processing platform enabled with a low power Zigbee radio, to allow for data transfer to the base station. An initial simulation of the scale's ability was carried out, using standard weights to simulate the brood chamber of a beehive and varying weight to mimic the production and consumption of honey. The results showed that the initial platform scale has a linear output characteristic. The analogue to digital converter was evaluated and the system was found to be able to detect changes in weight in the order of tens of grams. A power analysis of the system was also undertaken to confirm that the solution was suitable for remote, battery powered, deployments.},

abstract={With increased in digitization the amount of homogeneous, unstructured, semi-structured, structured or heterogeneous data being created and stored is exploding is collectively called “Dataspace”. Data being generated from various heterogeneous sources like, digital images, audio, video, online transactions, online social media, data from sensor nodes, click streams for different domains including, retails, medical, healthcare, energy, and day to day life utilities. In business, industries, institutions and organizations, individuals contribute the data volume like technical reports, seminar reports, research papers, dissertations, thesis etc. For instance, 30 billion web pages are accessed or the World Wide Web. With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms. In this we also explained how ranking can be used in Dataspace with challenges to information retrieval from heterogeneous data or from Dataspace.},

Emergency notification mechanism has to be hassle free and quick, in order to have efficient response for any disaster, health-fix, act of terrorism, etc. In this paper, we present service architecture for emergency alert, using Fog computing. Fog computing brings cloud resources close to the underlying devices and IoTs, which makes it ideal for latency sensitive services. Furthermore, Fog is used for offloading resource constrained devices. Our smart phone based service, known as Emergency Help Alert Mobile Cloud (E-HAMC) provides a quick way of notifying the relevant emergency dealing department, utilizing the services of Fog for offloading as well as pre-processing purposes. The service sends the location of incident and contacts the appropriate emergency dealing department automatically through already stored contact numbers. The emergency related information is then synchronized automatically from Fog to the Cloud, allowing further analysis and improvement in safety of the people and creates extended portfolio of services for the concerned authorities as well as the users. Performance in most certain scenarios is also evaluated and presented in this study, which shows the applicability of our system and its future prospects.},

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers.},

In this paper, we review the functionalities of the M2M ecosystem together with the standard models and explore the possibilities to use a specific connection management platform enabled by 3GPP mobile networks and utilizing OMA Lightweight M2M Enabler (LWM2M) for device management. Although this technology targets mainly constrained devices with low power and small amount of memory, it can be also utilized with powerful devices and sensors that can benefit from its efficient communication and strong security mechanisms. Being based on the very last standards in M2M communication there is no other documented approach or platform to set against.},

abstract={By enabling diverse and large-scale transducers, large-area electronics raises the potential for electronic systems to interact much more extensively with the physical world than is possible today. This can substantially expand the scope of applications, both in number and in value. But first, translation into applications requires a base of system functions (instrumentation, computation, power management, communication). These cannot be realized on the desired scale by large-area electronics alone. It is necessary to combine large-area electronics with high-performance, high-efficiency technologies, such as crystalline silicon CMOS, within hybrid systems. Scalable hybrid systems require rethinking the subsystem architectures from the start by considering how the technologies should be interfaced, on both a functional and physical level. To explore platform architectures along with the supporting circuits and devices, we consider as an application driver, a self-powered sheet for high-resolution structural health monitoring (of bridges and buildings). Top-down evaluation of design alternatives within the hybrid design space and pursuit of template architectures exposes circuit functions and device optimizations traditionally overlooked by bottom-up approaches alone.},

abstract={Current designs of modern office workplaces focus on health and safety standards but minimally address worker comfort and satisfaction. However, physical and mental wellness indicators directly affect the output of the worker according to existing studies that illustrate the strong relationship between workplace conditions and productivity. Personal and environmental sensed data can inform smarter workplace design and operations to potentially increase productivity and benefit all stakeholders in the modern workplace. This paper introduces a project that will measure environmental variables and personal physical and mental parameters of employees in different office environments to determine correlations with productivity. In-vivo measurements are obtained via a combination of environmental sensor modules and personal monitoring devices that record the interplay between variables affecting comfort and productivity in a workplace. The office spaces included in the study vary in age, heating/cooling management systems and the internal environmental efficiency of the buildings' design. This paper presents the pilot study that obtained bio-metric data from body area network sensors for each participant and environmental data on the state for workplace including thermal, humidity and light measurements. The participants were given self-reflective micro-surveys on productivity during the time of data collection. The preliminary results indicate that despite climate controlled conditions (i.e., a sealed air conditioned building), natural variance and sub-optimal conditions directly affected reported productivity.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been a focus for research in recent years. They enable data gathering across a wide range of domains and areas of interest from health service to environment monitoring, security, etc. Sensors are becoming cheaper, and as a result are being deployed in high density, at the same time; users' requirements of the network are changing frequently, they can even exceed the capabilities of the sensors in the network sometimes. The network is expected to operate for a long period of time with many nodes operating on batteries. These challenges have raised the attention to the problem of mission assignment in WSNs. Mission assignment aims at allocating tasks to specific sensors in the network -according to their capabilities-to answer users requirements while at the same time preserving the energy of the network. This paper approaches the problem of mission assignment from a geospatial perspective: because sensors' readings and data are associated with spatial properties of the sensors like their location and sensing range; spatial reasoning is an important aspect of mission assignment. However, spatial reasoning is still very limited in WSNs and has not received much attention because of the lack of standardized modelling of space. In the center of our approach an integration of two ontologies; the W3C semantic sensor network ontology (SSN) which describes sensor nodes in the network and GeoSPARQL (the OGC standard for modelling and reasoning about spatial data). We present Geospatial Sensor Mission Assignment algorithm (GeoSMA); a branch and bound algorithm based on the spatial functions and relations between tasks' and sensors' spatial properties. The aim is to find the most appropriate set of nodes to answer various missions required by the users.},

However there are some obstacles to realize mobile healthcare. Connectivity of miniaturized wearable sensors of the body area network (BAN) to the Internet is one of the most important issues in realizing mobile healthcare system. Interoperability is also important in order for sensor data not to be isolated in a local system. In this paper, we designed our mobile healthcare system resolving connectivity and interoperability issues. In our mobile healthcare system, body sensors are integrated by leveraging RESTful web service via CoAP over IPv6, enabling web-based access from browsers. Extended EPCglobal architecture was used for our system to enable sharing of sensor data among applications with different domain through the standardized protocol. We developed two applications, patient browser and EagleEye, to prove its feasibility.},

abstract={Mobile social networking becomes increasingly popular with the explosive growth of mobile devices. By allowing mobile users to interact with potential friends around the real world, it enables new social interactions as a complement to web-based online social networks. In this paper, we introduce a secure friend discovery mechanism based on encounter history in mobile social networks. By exploring the fact that sharing encounters indicate common activities and interests, our scheme can help people make friends with like-minded strangers nearby. We provide peer-to-peer confidential communications with the location privacy and encounter privacy being strictly preserved. Unlike most existing works that either rely on a trusted centralized server or existing social relationships, our algorithm is designed in an ad-hoc model with no such limitation. As a result, our design is more suitable and more general for mobile social scenarios. Extensive theoretical analysis and experimental study are conducted, and the results indicate that our scheme is feasible and effective for privacy-preserving friend discovery in mobile social networks.},

abstract={It is reported that there are hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by seasonal flu all around the world every year. More other diseases such as chickenpox, malaria, etc. are also serious threat to people's physical and mental health. Therefore proper techniques for disease surveillance are highly demanded. Recently, social media analysis is regarded as an efficient way to achieve this goal, which is feasible since growing number of people post their health information to social media such as blogs, personal website, etc. Previous work on social media analysis mainly focused on English materials but hardly considered Chinese materials, which hinders the use of such technique for Chinese people. In this paper, we proposed a new method of Chinese social media analysis for disease surveillance. More specifically, we compared different kinds of methods in the process of classification, and then proposed a new way to process Chinese text data. The Chinese Sina micro-blog data collected from September to December 2013 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that a high classification precision of 87.49% in average is obtained. Comparing with the data from the authority, Chinese national influenza center, we can predict the outbreak time of flu 5 days earlier.},

abstract={Pipelines are one of the most widely used means for oil/gas and water transportation worldwide. These pipelines are often subject to failures like erosion, sabotage and theft, causing high financial, environmental and health risks. Therefore, detecting leakages, estimating its size and location is very important. Current pipeline monitoring systems needs to be more automated, efficient and accurate methods for continuous inspection/reporting about faults. For this purpose, several pattern recognition and data mining techniques have been brought into the research community. In light of the issues of low efficiency and high false alarm rates in traditional pipeline condition monitoring, in this paper, we have used negative pressure wave (NPW) coupled with intelligent machine learning techniques integrated in distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) to identify specific events beased on raw data gathered by individual sensor nodes. This collaborative approach reduces communication overhead to minimum by processing raw data on sensor nodes directly and reporting the detected events only.

title={Scarecrow: Avatar Representation Using Biological Information Feedback},

abstract={Scarecrow is an avatar representation method that uses biological information to improve the immersive experience. Traditional computer games and virtual reality (VR) environments focus on operability and the immersive experience. Controller devices are used to communicate from the real world with the virtual world. The usability of control methods affect the immersive experience of the users. Recently, many of these VR environments have adopted motion sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect sensors) Motion sensors can measure the user's movements and gestures to input control parameters for the virtual world and a self-avatar. Motion sensor-based games can help users to become more active and take steps to advance their health. Biological information, such as heart rate, body temperature, and muscle fatigue change depending on exercise volume. In this paper, we use a real-time biological information feedback to synchronize the user and the avatar representation. For instance, the color of the avatar changes according to the skin temperature of the user's face. We hypothesize that this representation method will motivate user activities, and improve the immersive experience. We implement a Scarecrow prototype using a streaming server for measurements of the user's behaviors and a front-end exercise game. We also perform an early user study to report the user experience and discuss the effects of the proposed method. We discuss the potential of the Scarecrow, which might encourage human exercise activities, and control human biological information.},

abstract={The machine-to-machine (M2M) communication network is a promising concept to improve the user experience. The M2M communication enables two M2M devices in proximity of each other to establish a direct local link and bypass the base station. Machine-to-machine communication can be applied to various important fields, such as military applications, public safety, environmental monitoring, commercial and social networking, and health and medical monitoring, ect. Hence the networks must exclude the faulty devices or faulty sensors to ensure the network Quality of Service (QoS). Fault detection is highly preferred on machine-to-machine communication networks. Device fault can be divided into two types: hard fault and soft fault. We will give a mechanism with capability to detect and distinguish soft fault devices. The simulation results indicate when a large number of machine-to-machine devices under a machine-to-machine communication network, the false alarm rate of the soft fault detection mechanism is close to 0% and the detection accuracy of it is close to 100%.},

pages={276-279},
abstract={The recognition of human motions based on wireless sensor network technology has several obvious advantages. Since traditional recognition technology adopts a single wireless link, it is effective to identify whether an individual stays in a certain area. However, the technology fails to effectively recognize high-level human motions such as falling and lying down, which is of great importance for home health care for elders and rescue for fire buildings. To solve this problem, we put forward an experimental model with two layer wireless links to facilitate human motion recognition. After presenting relevant feasibility analysis, we conducted simulation experiments and applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the recognition of human motions. Experimental results show that the model makes a satisfactory performance in the recognition of the four human motions: walking, standing, lying down and normal state.},

abstract={This paper proposes a continuous location and skeletal tracking system using multiple RGB-Depth sensors (such as Kinects) deployed along a corridor with overlapping coverages. First, we transform the coordinates of all sensor into a unified coordinate. Second, the system recognizes users (such as patients under rehabilitation) from different views of these sensors and classifies them by their patient IDs. Third, the patient information can be continuously handed over among sensors when they move around the area. Experiment results show that the skeletal association during handover achieves approximately 90.61% in accuracy and 96.89% in precision in 44,817 experiment trials. By our observation, injured people possess asymmetric gait parameters especially on the ratio of the duration of the swing/stance phase. For example, the injured foot generally has a longer swinging duration than the healthy side. The proposed system has potential in patient rehabilitation monitoring applications.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that considers the pervasive presence of things or objects/equipment that communicate through wireless, cable connections and can interact with each other and can collaborate with other things or objects, to create new services and medical applications in order to achieve common objectives (diagnosis, treatment, patient rehabilitation). Considering that the Android operating system allows data storage, connectivity, Web browser, media support, development environment, we propose to develop an application that will come in support to any patient who is suffering from hypotension/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or other metabolic diseases associated, and even more for patients with vision impairments who are unable to be independent. With the help of such application the patients and physicians can monitor measured values of blood pressure, values of blood glucose, weight, body mass index, cholesterol, etc., having the possibility of creating a database and a medical history, in which the values specified by the medical devices are stored on the smartphone using Bluetooth™ technique. In this paper we developed an application on the Android platform which aims at recording data measured (SBP - Systolic Blood Pressure, DBP - Diastolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate) by the electronic sphygmomanometer which communicates using Bluetooth™ technique. The application offers the possibility of transmitting medical data via mobile Internet or wireless. Data will be compared with standard values and if these values are not in the normal range, the patient is alerted, including family doctor, or in the worst case the emergency service.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Nanotechnology is providing a new set of tools to design and manufacture miniaturized devices such as sensors or on/off chips networks. Such devices require wireless communications for information sharing and coordination. Unfortunately, reducing the size of a classical metallic antenna down to a few micrometres would impose the use of very high resonant frequencies, from the near infrared to the optical ranges (tens of hundreds of THz). This would drastically limit their communication range and require the implementation of transceivers able to operate at this extremely high frequency. Graphene offers a new approach to radically downscale antennas thanks to its ability to support the propagation of Surface-Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in the terahertz frequency band. Graphene micro-antennas provide a better integrability for future miniaturized wireless systems and represents an enabling technology for applications such as Wireless NanoSensor Networks, Internet of Things and On/Off-Chip Wireless Networks. In this talk we will describe the fundamental properties behind graphene miniaturized antennas as well as its applications.},

abstract={We present an approach that combines semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool to enable the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users. In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning. Possible applications of the presented system include the configuration of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},

abstract={Modern-day devices like smart-phones, tablets, televisions etc. possess very powerful processors and huge storage capacities compared to what were available a few years ago. Most of these devices are also connected to the Internet. However, the full capabilities of these devices are not fully harnessed and thus, they are not as intelligent as they could be. These devices, together with the Internet, can be used as “Internet of Things” where each device can be both producer and consumer of information. This framework is realizable in a real dynamic system if there is an intelligent distributed layer above it which can cater to services of all heterogeneous devices as required. The existing solutions to this problem are either too hardware dependent, or too abstract. In this paper we present a concept of this layer using mobile agents which makes the system flexible and dynamically adaptable. This layer has been deployed using a publicly available Prolog-based mobile agent emulator (however, any other mobile agent framework can also be used). The proposed approach is capable of updating information like availability and usability of services dynamically. It also has speech processing modules to provide solutions using voice-based commands and prompts. The prototype is scalable and robust to partial network failures. The implementation details and performance analysis of this work are reported and discussed. This framework can be used to deploy systems which can enable people to search for services like health facilities, food services, transportation, law and order using a common interface including voice commands.},

In this context, this paper proposes an architecture that considers the use of different types of health managers and gateways, but keeping interoperability by the use of widely adopted standards. The main contribution of this work is the distribution of health managers in different locations, such as mobile devices and cloud applications, enabling the use of a single health service for different types of PHDs. The ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is used as core technology, enabling the transport of PHD information over different technologies and protocols. We also present a new classification of health managers based on requirements of legacy m-health services.

abstract={In recent years, digital communication and telecommunication have gained immense usage and introduced several innovative services (e.g. video conferencing, online banking, e-Health, etc) that change the life of people. By 2020, some telecommunication providers expect to have 50 Billion devices connected to each others. The whole world is getting closely connected with the new telecommunication technologies especially the Mobile broadband technology. The expectations indicate that not only human will be connected but also devices and machines will be connected communicating altogether through the Mobile broadband technology. These tremendous improvements in telecom will introduce new and innovative services that touch every small detail of people's life. Consequently, telecom networks will become more complex, involve more resources, and demand more requirements. Thus, network optimization will be crucial to avoid wasting the resources and ensure service availability and network efficiency. To help achieving that, network operators require intelligent methods to understand the ongoing traffic and services characteristics in order to control and forecast the live/ongoing traffic. In LTE networks, video traffic makes up the largest segment of data traffic. This paper discusses the video traffic characteristics in LTE networks, checks the stationarity status of the LTE video traffic and presents a method to transform the non-stationary LTE video traffic to stationary data.},

They have high potential impacts in many fields, including: education, healthcare, monitoring, retail, and science. Wireless sensor networks are composed of a large number of sensor nodes with limited energy resources. There is a need to design protocols that adapt much better to the constraints of the sensor network environment. I propose a protocol called Large Scale Environmental Monitoring and Maintaining Sensing Coverage in Sensor Networks. When an event is expected to occur in an area, the application requires a minimum percentage of sensor coverage. Since the sensor nodes are deployed randomly in the sensing field, it may consist of sensor nodes with overlapping coverage areas providing redundant data. It would be desirable to save energy in some sensor nodes by allowing them to sleep, when sensor node is covered by the neighbors of sensor nodes.},

Smartphones and other mobile devices can be transformed into effective nutrition tracking tools that consumers can easily make use of to help improve their lives and wellbeing. The academic community has conducted a vast amount of research in the area of mobile nutrition however a number of challenges still exist in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI). HCI has been found to be a key contributing factor when developing systems that constantly and directly interact with their respective users. Effective HCI is required to bridge the communication barrier between a user and the device, thus ensuring a seam-less approach. This research paper highlights the efforts done by academics in the area of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape. Every study will be discussed in detailed by highlighted the key benefits together with a number of challenges that still exist. As a result, this review of literature will identify key lacunae that still exist in the field of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape.},

abstract={In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.},

abstract={Massive medical and health care data has been generated, asking for research and development of cloud storage system. In order to improve its scalability and reliability at the same time shorten user access time, the multiple data replica scheme should be adopted and the proper location for each replica should be determined. In this paper, a multiple data replica placement scheme for cloud storage under health-care IoT environment is proposed. It based on p-median model with minimizing the total access cost, which includes user access cost and maintenance cost, as its optimization objective. It uses MOX (Mosquitoes Oviposition Mating) algorithm to find the optimal data replica placement solution and uses SA(Simulated Annealing) algorithm to optimize user access request assignment to the specific data replica. We have implemented the proposed scheme based on CloudSim and have done performance evaluation. Simulation results have shown that it can not only improve user access time and promote load balance but also enhance system scalability and reliability.},

abstract={Sensor Networks are increasingly playing a fundamental role in many application scenarios such as agriculture, maritime, healthcare, industrial and even military application. However, the high heterogeneity of sensor networks poses a great challenge in interoperability and cooperative work, and the building of technological bridges among wireless sensor network (WSN) islands is more and more a must for smart cities for an efficient operation. In this paper, we present a model for an Area Sensor Network (ASN) that combines and connects small networks (Body Sensor Networks), WSNs and even fixed sensor networks within a particular area of interest. Initial tests show that the combination of sensed data from multiple sources (sensor networks) produces synergetic services useful for smart cities.},

abstract={Storage batteries are widely applied as backup power in different industries like telecom, power utility, and data center and so on. At the same time, real time knowledge about the battery condition (SOC and SOH) is very significant to ensure the performance of critical power system. However, existing methods of manual measurement for battery or online battery monitoring system will require complicated wire connection and they are somehow risky during measurement. Meanwhile these operations will also require very professional personnel. Therefore, their applications have big limitation. This paper is to introduce a new type of battery and corresponding measurement (we named it as “Intelligent Battery”). We will apply new methods to measure battery condition using the communication way of power line carrier (PLC). This way of measurement will require a redesigning of storage battery which will bring revolutionary changes to battery and battery measurement. And this will become the footstone for building Internet of Things, a smarter way of battery maintenance and management. Users will have a real time monitor for battery. What's more, the exterior appearance and wire connection of the “Intelligent Battery” will be exactly the same like conventional batteries.},

abstract={With the advent of Smart City, quality of life is bound to be better. But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option. In this paper, a fuzzy assisted data gathering and alert scheme is proposed for healthcare services. Thus unnecessary waste of energy by transmission of unnecessary information is avoided. We have implemented it using Arduino and eHealth sensor kit.},

abstract={In hyperconnectivity scenario, managing the amount of data acquired from sensors in the Body Area Networks (BANs) is one of the major issues. In this paper we propose an on-chip context predictor based sparse sensing technology with smart transmission architecture which makes use of confidence interval calculation from the features that present in the data, thereby achieving statistical guarantee. The proposed architecture uses intelligent sparse sensing, which eradicates the collection of redundant data, thereby reducing the amount of data generated. For the performance analysis, we considered ECG data acquisition and transmission system. The proposed architecture when applied on the data collected from 10 patients reduces the duty cycle of the sensing unit to 27.99%, by achieving an energy saving of 72% and the mean deviation of sampled data from the original data is 2%.},

It is contended that the integration of four key drivers (mobiles, data, sensors and social media) has a profound impact on society and human interaction on the social as well as the business scene. Whilst this impact has been intrusive, in that integration of these four key drivers eliminates the natural boundaries of privacy, it has also been beneficial in socioeconomic terms. These benefits are discussed from the perspective of the medical (mobile health) and business marketing (right time experiences) disciplines. Moreover, other business benefits from the use of these technologies have also been discussed in this paper. It is envisioned that this discursive paper will lead to an enlightenment within the continent and deepen the appreciation of integrative technologies. This paper asserts that these drivers, as stellar examples of best practice within the fields of medical and business marketing, can lead to similar innovations in other service industries.},

abstract={The first wearables DevCon for developers of wearables was held in San Francisco 5-7 March 2014 and was greeted with great enthusiasm, with more than 1,000 people attending the three-day event. With the introduction of Google Glass, Epson Moverio, Pebble, and Fitbit, wearables have certainly captured the attention of many consumers and enterprises. While some of these wearables mainly provide a single function, such as fitness tracking, health monitoring, and message display, others have taken on the integration of multiple functions in the same device; the BASIS watch, for example, combines time, fitness, and health-monitoring functions into a single device. According to a new market report published by Transparency Market Research, “Wearable Technology Market-Global Scenario, Trends, Industry Analysis, Size, Share and Forecast, 2012-2018,? the global wearable technology market is expected to grow from US$750 million in 2012 to US$5.8 billion in 2018. U.K.-based Juniper Research projects that the number of wearable devices shipped will rise from about 13 million in 2013 to 130 million in 2018, and the size of the market will jump from US$1.4 billion in 2013 to US$19 billion in 2018. Business Insider Intelligence projects shipments of 100 million units in 2014 and forecasts the market will ultimately be worth about US$12 billion per year. Such widely divergent forecasts by research firms are typical when industries are in their relative infancies and hypergrowth mode.},

A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile.

abstract={A common service platform is considered as the key enabler to catalyze the development of IoT/M2M applications for a large variety of vertical markets such as smart energy, smart transportation, home and industry automation, eHealth and connected vehicles. This paper reports an initial effort at National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan with such an experimental approach. We first train our graduate students with an ETSI M2M architecture-compliant service platform OpenMTC from FOKUS, and then charter them with the tasks of developing diverse M2M applications. The effort is used as a feasibility study to investigate how useful the notion of a common service platform for IoT/M2M is and how urgent an international standard is required in defining such a platform. We intend to use the result of the study to create a suitable IoT/M2M curriculum for our students.},

abstract={Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication has emerged as a key technology with huge market potential for cellular service providers deploying LTE networks. Addition of enormous number of M2M devices into the cellular networks poses a heavy competition to existing Human-to-Human (H2H) devices for getting radio resources, thereby affecting the performance of the H2H communications. But, one can not treat all M2M flows as low priority and schedule them after H2H flows, as there are many M2M applications like healthcare and tracking which are of high importance and delay-intolerant. Hence, there is a need for class based priority scheduling of the traffic of M2M and H2H sessions in the network. In this paper, we propose a class based dynamic priority scheduling algorithm for uplink transmission of M2M and H2H traffic in LTE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by various metrics such as H2H throughput and system throughput and also compared with existing schedulers.},

abstract={Internet-of-Thing (IoT) has been identified as one of the next generation technologies from different aspects. Among different technologies for IoT, wireless-sensor-network (WSN) is one of key technologies to be developed. To demonstrate WSN capabilities in applications, this work developed self-developed sensor node (Super-Node) and applied the device into an on-field structure-health-monitoring (SHM) task. The developed WSN system achieved requirements of SHM applications, i.e. 128 Hz sampling rate with tri-axial acceleration data within one sensor node. By acquired data, the developed system can make the prediction of structure status. In addition, a local-data-processing node and algorithm was also implemented to promote usability of WSN system in SHM applications. With Huffman code implemented, the wireless transmission payload was reduced by 60% and the node capacity can be increased by 3 times. This work not only demonstrated the capability of WSN technologies in on-field SHM applications but also provided a better solution for IoT development.},

The applications of WSNs have been widely spread in different fields including battle and health monitoring fields.

However, the current simulators are still limited to cover all of the applications of WSNs, especially the ones that require deployment in three dimensions (3D) such as smart home, smart classroom, smart city, and smart University. In this paper, we introduce our vision and implementation of the first 3D WSN simulator, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, we present the concept of multimodal WSNs where a Motes may involve different sensing devices. Some parts of our simulator, named Mote Placement Optimization Tool (MPOT), are built on of-the-shelf components with some modifications.

abstract={Robotic applications are becoming ubiquitous. They are widely used in several areas (e.g., healthcare, disaster management, and manufacturing). However, their provisioning still faces several challenges such as cost and resource usage efficiency. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that may aid in tackling these challenges. It has three main facets: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper focuses on the IaaS aspects of robotic applications as cloud computing services. It proposes an architecture that enables cost efficiency through virtualization and dynamic task delegation to robots, including robots that might belong to other clouds. Overlays and RESTful Web services are used as cornerstones. A prototype is built using LEGO Mindstorms NXT as the robotic platform, and JXTA as the overlay middleware. Related work is reviewed, the functional entities and interfaces of the architecture are described, and the prototype architecture is presented along with the implemented scenario.},

Few researchers have studied such applications and one of their problems is the 3D deployment. Most of them use a deterministic deployment method and build all of the network measurements and consideration based on such deployment. In addition, there is a lack of 3D simulators that handles such deployment including the 3D environment, 3D channel models, and 3D optimization objectives.

abstract={Multi-Sensory mobile health monitoring systems promise substantial improvements in the quality of healthcare. However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},

abstract={In the remote health care monitoring applications, the collected medical data from bio-medical sensors should be transmitted to the nearest gateway for further processing. Transmission of data contributes to a significant amount of power consumption by the transmitter and increase in the network traffic. In this paper we propose a low complex rule engine based health care data acquisition and smart transmission system architecture, which uses IEEE 802.15.4 standard for transferring data to the gateway. The power consumed and the network traffic generated by the device can be reduced by event based transmission rather than continuous transmission of data. We developed two different rule engines: static rule engine and adaptive rule engine, which decides whether to transmit the collected data based on the important features extracted from the data, thereby achieving power saving. In this paper, ECG data acquisition and transmission architecture is considered. The metrics used for performance analysis are the amount of power saving and reduction in network traffic. It is shown that the proposed rule engine gives a significant reduction in energy consumption and network traffic generated.},

Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile.

abstract={While wearable sensor systems are now widely used to monitor vital signs in hospitals and at home, most such systems are designed for bedridden patients. In contrast, the use of wireless sensors to capture physiological data from patients for long term health monitoring is becoming increasingly popular although some previous studies recorded complaints from users about discomfort when wearing these. In addition, these systems can sometimes suffer from interference from existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is both comfortable to use and does not encounter interference with existing wireless traffic is required. This paper presents a system design that includes a probe, sensor, radio, and receiver for a long term heart rate monitoring in a senior center. This system has been deployed in a senior center since May 2012, and 63 seniors have used this system in this period. The senior center has its own wireless network, and no changes were made to this. The monitoring system presented in this work runs together with the existing network, and achieves a 97% packet delivery rate.},

abstract={Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a treatment that focuses on psychological and behavioral factors. Although the CBT-I has proven efficacy, yet 32%-V89% of patients fail to consistently follow recommendations. The critical challenge of CBT-I is how to enhance the adherence of patients to therapy. In this study, we propose a persuasion method which integrates machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion for enhancing adherence, and we design a mobile application Win-Win ASleep (WWaS). We performed a 6-week study to evaluate the usability of WWaS on enhancing behavioral and recording adherence in comparison to a paper-based diary. Results show that machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion enhanced the adherence of patients in different manner, and WWaS assists users keeping a sleep diary accurate and complete. These higher quality records of sleep diary benefits the therapy. We also discuss strategies and provide recommendations for designing similar mobile applications to promote healthy behavior.},

abstract={Gas-consumed urban transportation causes the problems of environment pollution and traffic congestion. Bicycling is an alternative transportation way for short-distance movement, which is a green and healthy style. Some modern cities are building Public Bicycle Sharing System (PBSS), so that inhabitants and tourists can temporarily use bicycles anywhere in the city. In this paper, Green Bicycling, a smartphone-based Public Bicycle Sharing System for healthy life is developed. Green Bicycling aims to improve the user experience and encourage cyclist to use BSS. It allows cyclist to query not only the current information of rental spots, but also the forecast state. To achieve this goal, an improved back propagation network prediction model is proposed. In addition, a quantitative measurement of calorie consumption in a riding trip is introduced into Green Bicycling, so that the cyclist could get intuitive understanding of how much calorie reduction from the riding. A simplified version of the Green Bicycling APP has been released in the Windows Phone Market.},

abstract={The control and prevention of transmissible diseases is an important public health concern. This paper gives a strategy to detect the transmission of contagion based on social network. With the popularity of the Weibo, a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook in China, people often posts his/her feelings when he/she or his/her friend suffers from disease. Thus, Weibo plays a social sensor role to surveill people's health status. By exploring more than 35.3 million tweets from Sina Weibo, we first filter the data according to the ILI (Influenza like Illness ) definition and compare the online social network data with the statistics summery of China CDC (Center of Disease Control and Prevention) using cosine similarity and the standard deviation metrics. Dynamic Bayesian Network is applied to detect the outbreak and transmission of influenza in a certain city considering the co-location and the social ties. The experiment results show our methods can give effective suggestions to control and prevent the influenza epidemic in China.},

We also propose to use pervasive cloud computing paradigm to improve the performance of food image recognition due to the heavy computing requirement for large number of concurrent recognition requests. Evaluations show that the proposed approach can give acceptable recognition rate, and MapReduce programming can provide promising performance advantage compared to traditional client server approach.},

abstract={with the increase of the aging population, the health of the aging will become a global focus. Wireless body area network, which as a low-cost, convenient and easy to use health monitoring system is being widely researched and now it has gained very large advancement. In this paper, we introduced the design and development of a wireless router which also integrated atmospheric Pressure, Humidity and Temperature (P-H-T) sensing functions for the body area network to relay different kinds of physiological signals from a comparatively further place. The standout advantages of the wireless router we designed can be summarized as the following 4 points: 1. High network throughput rate: the network throughput rate could be as high as 73.6Kbytes/s when the data transmitted through three jumps; 2. Low packet loss rate: the packet loss rate is just 0.4% when date transmitted 50 meters through three jumps; 3. High transmission power: to enhance the wireless communication capability, wireless power amplifier is applied and the transmission power of the router can be up to 20dBm; 4. Multi-functions: besides the relay function, the router could also perform the P-H-T environment monitoring function. In this paper, we mainly introduced the design and implementation of the zigbee router, and then we described the experiments done on the network performance and the health and environment monitoring function. The designed zigbee router could also be used in other many applications such as elderly activity monitoring of the community, the forest fire detection, and so on.},

abstract={Awareness of emotion status of people is fairly important for aged ones, the ones with sub-health status, and various patients in order to keep them in good mood. The emotion recognition at run time is intrinsically challenging due to its complexity nature. On the one hand, the awareness of human emotion should be achieved as non-intrusive as possible. On the other hand, the android smart phones on the market are increasingly popular which are equipped with various sensors that can be used to achieve the awareness of emotion status. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the heart beat rate and contents of user's talk, which are obtained from built-in camera and microphone on smart phones. We first classify anger, joy, normal, and sadness based on heart rates, then the emotion recognition is further improved by emotional key words in a talk. We have evaluated this approach in terms of recognition accuracy and power consumption found that the accuracy can achieve 84.7%.},

abstract={IPv6 Low-power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) have recently found renewed interest because of the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT).However, mobility support in 6LoWPANs is still in its infancy for large-scale IP-based sensor technology in future IoT. The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Our initial numerical results show a reduction of the handoff costs on the mobile router which normally constitute a bottleneck in such a system. We also discuss important metrics such as signaling overload, bandwidth efficiency and power consumption and how they can be optimized through the mobility management.},

abstract={Smart community leverages information and communications technology to improve the quality of life in terms of education, health care, and government services. In smart community, residents manage their home appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.},

Some medical IoT sensors translate and receive the massive data every time and on the other hand some equipment just translate emergency signal for help calling. All these communication process should be treated separately to keep the efficiency of ISM band utility.

abstract={As the world is moving towards the “Internet of Things” [1], Internet Protocol enabled wireless sensor network is becoming an important research area. In order to make it possible and to facilitate transmission of IPv6 packets over low powered networks, 6LoWPAN [9,11] has been introduced. 6LoWPAN incorporates an adaptation layer between network and data link layers. Two routing schemes are used in 6LoWPAN depending on which layer takes routing, forwarding decisions. If adaptation layer takes the decision, then it is called mesh under, whereas if the network layer is involved, then the scheme is route over. In this paper, we present a comparative study of these two schemes. Various performance metrics, such as average round-trip time delay, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio are compared and suitability of the two schemes are analyzed for a Sensor-Grid infrastructure. We also propose a technique which improves the route-over scheme. Our ultimate goal is to apply this Sensor-Grid infrastructure in health-care applications.},

abstract={We present an Adaptive Beaconing Medium Access Control (AB-MAC) protocol based on time division multiple access (TDMA) in order to provide healthcare services. The purpose of our protocol is to gain not only energy-efficiency but also provide low delivery latency when both periodic data and event-driven data are present. In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose standby slots that are deployed during each beacon interval. The standby slots are able to identify unscheduled data with low delivery latency. An adaptive beacon is then provided that quickly reschedules the time slots. Furthermore, the AB-MAC asymmetrically assigns energy consumption to a hub instead of the sensor nodes when possible in order to reduce node's energy waste. In this paper, we evaluate IEEE 802.15.4 and AB-MAC in energy consumption and delivery latency. The simulation results indicate that the AB-MAC outperforms than IEEE 802.15.4 in BSNs.},

abstract={The new generation of devices connected to Internet are moving towards billion of small and smart objects, so-called Smart Things. These Smart Things are destined to manage the security of our houses, watch our health, and optimize the energy consumption of our cities. They bring a new set of opportunities, but they also present high challenges regarding scalability, management, bootstrapping, identity verification and authentication. For that reason, this work is focused on addressing the security requirements for Smart Things providing an optimized family of primes for Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC), denominated Shifting Primes. ECC on Smart Things needs special optimizations for the cryptographic primitives that requires a precise study of the instruction set and the number of cycles for those instructions. The modular multiplication is the basic operation, critical for highly constrained microprocessors, in terms of which ECC is built. It is optimized and also analyzed the interaction between partial results in the chain of modular multiplications needed for ECC. This optimizations have been carried out over the MSP430, which is a widely extended microprocessor for Smart Things. MSP430 is featured by not offering hardware multiplier. For that reason, we have defined a special kind of prime numbers, the Shifting Primes. They are featured by offering a very fast multiplication algorithm for ECC through addition and shifting operations for the multiplications. It is presented the full faster multiplication algorithm for Shifting Primes. These results are presenting a lowest time and number of operations for the multiplication in ECC than the existing solutions. Finally, note that the presented primes can be applied also to other similar architectures with fast shifting operation on registers.},

abstract={Nowadays the use of smart phones gets more and more widespread in the whole world. How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are convergence of real physical world and computation world. CPS systems are rapidly becoming an important development strategies with broad application domains. The key requirements for CPS systems are to support multiple applications with many different resources at the same time in timeliness and also ensure energy efficiency. This paper presents the Cyber-Physical integrated cloud computing system called Cyber-Physical Cloud (CPC) to solve these key requirements. CPC architecture is designed for various applications such as health care, smart cars, traffic control, etc where multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) communicate with each other through mobile ad hoc network. Concurrently, CPC architecture can leverage cloud computing to process effectively computation and resource management by virtualization technique. Moreover, CPS systems are built on heterogeneous WSNs to collect and process the physical objects by obtaining data and thereafter processing queries. As a part of CPS systems, the key requirement for WSNs is to sustain a long lifetime because of limited power supplies. We work on real time preemptive query scheduling in WSNs with a focus on quality of data (QoD) to analysis useful energy consumption and interference energy consumption. We propose the Energy efficiency Aware Quality of Data (EAQD) method that runs on real time preemptive query scheduling to find the expected QoD for each query thus enabling energy consumption minimization. EAQD method also computes the transmitting/receiving slots needed for each query to avoid wasting slots. The simulation results show the our approach can reduce energy consumption up to 5 times as compares to previous approaches.},

The topic is the examination of possibilities of interconnecting information sources in the area of monitoring/control of technological process (TP) in the underground mine and in the area of safety, and their comprehensive presentation to the user. Information will be presented by virtual reality means, when the true presentation of technological scene with suitably presented information is at user's disposal. The user is not only a mere scene observer but, thanks to the interactive functions of virtual environment; he/she will become a part of this scene. In this way, the amount of information that the dispatcher or manager is able to accept and correctly and easily understand, and that forms the knowledge base for his/her decision making will increase. Just support to decision making processes is the area to which significant benefit can be brought. This kind of systems will allow getting support to decision making not only in the common mode of operation, but especially in the mode of crisis management when dealing with extraordinary events. It is also the role of this system in the area of training and education that will be irreplaceable. New attempts to information sources represented by Internet of Things are mentioned too.},

It has considerable effects not only in terms of enhancing quality of life for patients, but also in reducing the financial burden on the health care system. The individualized weekly medicament blister for patients (7¿¿4 Box) from 7¿¿4 Pharma increases the compliance and helps to keep the health expenditures as low as possible. A potential extension of the 7¿¿4 Box could be a digital product memory which makes the imprinted data on the box electronically accessible in order to enable new innovative services which helps to increase the compliance. If we do not secure the data from an unauthorized access there is a possibility that third parties can read the data unperceived and on a grand scale.

What are we giving up by spending all of our spare time checking our smartphones? Are we losing the potential time to daydream and find creative, imaginative solutions to important problems?

pages={1-5},
abstract={In the last decade, the seminal term and concept of “m-health” were first defined and introduced in this transactions as “mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for healthcare.” Since that special section, the m-health concept has become one of the key technological domains that reflected the key advances in remote healthcare and e-health systems. The m-health is currently bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare delivery and technology sectors. From the wireless communications perspective, the current decade is expected to bring the introduction of new wireless standards and network systems with true mobile broadband and fast internet access healthcare services. These will be developed around what is currently called the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. In this editorial paper, we will introduce the new and novel concept of 4G health that represents the long-term evolution of m-health since the introduction of the concept in 2004. The special section also presents a snapshot of the recent advances in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the evolved m-health perspective. It will also present some of the concepts that can go beyond the traditional “m-health ecosystem” of the existing systems. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging healthcare delivery concept.},

abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},
