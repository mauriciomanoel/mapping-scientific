abstract = "This study aims to explore factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt hearing aids among old adults in smart cities. It argues that trust is a moderator to influence the relationship between attitude, subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention in smart cities. This study tests hypotheses using a sample of 103 respondents from six smart cities in China. The results reveal that attitude is main factor influencing individual's behavioral intention. Subjective norm and trust are both not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval in the model of multiple-regression. Interestingly, it finds that trust moderates the relationship between subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention. It means that the audiologists' advice can positively affect person's behavioral intention in smart cities. The findings imply that the Theory of Reasoned Action can be partially used to explain the person's behavioral intention in Chinese context. This study contributes to encourage old people to use smart hospitals to consult audiologists about hearing loss and hearing aids rehabilitation. Hence, hearing aids can improve their quality of life (QoL), which can be reflected by the improved standard of living, better access to treatments and also the positive sentiment about their life, including comfort, friendship, happiness and a closer connection to the society.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

As populations continue to age, the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions in older adults grows. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of smart homes on older patients with chronic conditions. A review and meta-analysis were conducted after searching both English and Chinese databases. Fifteen RCTs were included in the review, with six studies qualifying for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed no significant effects on measures of hospital admissions (RR =0.90, 95% CI (0.57, 6.34), P = 0.65) or emergency department admissions (RR =0.99, 95% CI (0.34, 2.91), P = 0.98). Likewise, no effects were observed for tele-monitoring on days spent in the hospital (MD =-0.90, 95% CI (-3.34, 1.55), P = 0.47) or quality of life. However, almost all participants were satisfied with the smart homes. The effect of tele-exercise on cognitive functioning was unclear. However, the smart homes did have an effect on physical functioning and depression in older adults with chronic conditions. Future studies should focus on the economic effectiveness, security, accessibility and practicality of smart homes on older adults with chronic conditions.",

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of using unobtrusively collected activity-aware smart home behavioral data to automatically detect one of the most common consequences of aging: functional health decline. After gathering the longitudinal smart home data of 29 older adults for an average of >2 years, we automatically labeled the data with corresponding activity classes and extracted time-series statistics containing 10 behavioral features. Using this data, we created regression models to predict absolute and standardized functional health scores, as well as classification models to detect reliable absolute change and positive and negative fluctuations in everyday functioning. Functional health was assessed every six months by means of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-Compensation (IADL-C) scale. Results show that total IADL-C score and subscores can be predicted by means of activity-aware smart home data, as well as a reliable change in these scores. Positive and negative fluctuations in everyday functioning are harder to detect using in-home behavioral data, yet changes in social skills have shown to be predictable. Future work must focus on improving the sensitivity of the presented models and performing an in-depth feature selection to improve overall accuracy.",

Around the world, populations are aging and there is a growing concern about ways that older adults can maintain their health and well-being while living in their homes.
Objectives
The aim of this paper was to conduct a systematic literature review to determine: (1) the levels of technology readiness among older adults and, (2) evidence for smart homes and home-based health-monitoring technologies that support aging in place for older adults who have complex needs.
Results
We identified and analyzed 48 of 1863 relevant papers. Our analyses found that: (1) technology-readiness level for smart homes and home health monitoring technologies is low; (2) the highest level of evidence is 1b (i.e., one randomized controlled trial with a PEDro score ≥6); smart homes and home health monitoring technologies are used to monitor activities of daily living, cognitive decline and mental health, and heart conditions in older adults with complex needs; (3) there is no evidence that smart homes and home health monitoring technologies help address disability prediction and health-related quality of life, or fall prevention; and (4) there is conflicting evidence that smart homes and home health monitoring technologies help address chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Conclusions
The level of technology readiness for smart homes and home health monitoring technologies is still low. The highest level of evidence found was in a study that supported home health technologies for use in monitoring activities of daily living, cognitive decline, mental health, and heart conditions in older adults with complex needs.",

Data is collected from multiple wearable sensors placed on subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest, is transmitted through IoMT devices to the integrated cloud and data analytics layer. To process huge amounts of data in parallel, Hadoop MapReduce techniques are used. Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, which fits into the MapReduce paradigm, is utilized to recognize the motion experienced by different body parts and provides higher scalability and better performance with parallel processing when compared to serial processor. Our proposed framework predicts 12 physical activities with an overall accuracy of 97.1%.

To offer practical guidance to nurse investigators interested in multidisciplinary research that includes assisting in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for “smart” health management and aging-in-place.
Methods
Ten health-assistive Smart Homes were deployed to chronically ill older adults from 2015 to 2018. Data were collected using five sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity). Nurses used telehealth and home visitation to collect health data and provide ground truth annotation for training intelligent algorithms using raw sensor data containing health events.
Findings
Nurses assisting with the development of health-assistive AI may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. We recommend: (a) using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data, (b) using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform.
Conclusions
Practical frameworks to guide nurse investigators integrating clinical data with sensor data for training machine learning algorithms may build capacity for nurses to make significant contributions to developing AI for health-assistive Smart Homes.",

We develop a two-fold solution, based on micro-services for the IoT (users’ smart devices) and the cloud side (back-end services). iTaaS includes configurations for (a) the IoT side to support data collection from IoT devices to a gateway on a real time basis and, (b) the cloud back-end side to support data sharing, storage and processing. iTaaS provides the technology foreground to enable immediate application deployments in the domain of interest. An obvious and promising implementation of this technology is e-Health and remote health monitoring. As a proof of concept we implement a real time remote patient monitoring system that integrates the proposed framework and uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pulse oximeter and heart rate monitoring sensing devices. The experimental analysis shows fast data collection, as (for our experimental setup) data is transmitted from the IoT side (i.e. the gateway) to the cloud in less than 130 ms. We also stress the back-end system with high user concurrency (e.g. with 40 users per second) and high data streams (e.g. 240 data records per second) and we show that the requests are executed at around 1 s, a number that signifies a satisfactory performance by considering the number of requests, the network latency and the relatively small size of the Virtual Machines implementing services on the cloud (2 GB RAM, 1 CPU and 20 GB hard disk size).",

Better supporting elderly people to continue live in their home using smart home technology is a key target application. However, most of the existing smart home solutions for the elderly are not designed with people’s emotional goals in mind, leading to lack of adoption, lack of engagement, and failure of the technology. In this paper, we introduce an emotion-oriented requirements engineering approach to help identifying, modeling and evaluating emotional goals. We also explain how we used this technique to help us develop SofiHub - a new smart home platform for elderly people. SofiHub comprises a range of devices and software for sensing, interaction, passive monitoring, and emergency assistance. We have conducted multiple trials including initial field trials for elderly people in real houses. We have used our emotion-oriented requirements techniques to evaluate the participants’ emotional reactions before, during, and after trials to understand the impact of such technology on elderly people’s emotions to the SofiHub solution. Our analysis shows that SofiHub successfully alleviates their loneliness, makes them feel safer and cared about. We also found that the trial participants developed a strong relation with the system and hence, felt frustrated when SofiHub did not respond in ways expected or desired. We reflect on the lessons learned from the trials related to our emotion-oriented design and evaluation experimental approach, including refining our set of evaluation tools.",

The research reveals key barriers to the adoption of smart homes such as reliability, data privacy, and costs of smart home technologies across the countries studied. On the other hand, housing stock characteristics, both age of buildings and tenure, reveal deeper cross-country differences in attitudes and perceptions towards these technologies. The research highlights the need for smart home services that go beyond energy consumption and management services. Only when such a holistic approach is adopted, where other applications such as health or security, suited to the householders’ needs and making positive contribution to their daily lives, are enabled, will the benefits of smart homes become clear to the consumer.",

We propose that augmenting data from multiple sensing devices such as Microsoft Kinect and Smartwatches can significantly improve the detection performance once incorporated in the context of an IoT framework. Kinect, being the feature-wise richest input device in the IoT world, is a favorite pick of most of the researchers for detecting postural activities. However, there are certain activity classes in IoT based smart environments on which Kinect based solutions result in high misclassifications. This is due to the similarities in 3D joint position space. For such scenarios, Kinect must be augmented with additional sensor(s) to achieve the desired level of accuracy. In this work, we improve the detection of the assistive activities related to sitting posture in general and dining-related activities in particular. Our research focus is to enable a robot to understand the activities of a human at the dining table and plan the assistive tasks accordingly. This is a two-step process; in the first step, Kinect sensor data is augmented with a collection of motion sensors’ data. Then, this data is analyzed for discrimination power through cross-validation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In addition, we propose a two-level security scheme consisting of key establishment and two-factor authentication for the IoT based activity recognition environment. Our experiments show that Kinect, when complemented by motion sensors’ data, reduces the confusion instances by up to 12% on average. Moreover, we demonstrate the data quality through clustering properties of the data using an unsupervised neural network.",

Most recently, it has been introduced as a potential solution to support independent living of people with disabilities and older adults, as well as to relieve the workload from family caregivers and health providers. One of the key supporting features of a smart home is its ability to monitor the activities of daily living and safety of residents, and in detecting changes in their daily routines. With the availability of inexpensive low-power sensors, radios, and embedded processors, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of networked sensors which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. This article reviews sensor technology used in smart homes with a focus on direct environment sensing and infrastructure mediated sensing. The article also points out the strengths and limitations of different sensor technologies, as well as discusses challenges and opportunities from clinical, technical, and ethical perspectives. It is recommended that sensor technologies for smart homes address actual needs of all stake holders including end users, their family members and caregivers, and their doctors and therapists. More evidence on the appropriateness, usefulness, and cost benefits analysis of sensor technologies for smart homes is necessary before these sensors should be widely deployed into real-world residential settings and successfully integrated into everyday life and health care services.",

The RiSH integrates a home service robot, a home sensor network, a body sensor network, a mobile device, cloud servers, and remote caregivers. A layered architecture is proposed to guide the design and implementation of the RiSH software. Basic service functions are developed to allow the RiSH to recognize human body activity using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the home service robot to perceive the environment through audio signals. Based on these functions, we developed two low-level applications: (1) particle filter-based human localization and tracking using wearable motion sensors and distributed binary sensors; (2) Dynamic Bayesian Network-based human activity recognition using microphones and distributed binary sensors. Both applications extend the robot’s perception beyond its onboard sensors. Utilizing the low-level applications, a high-level application is realized that detects and responds to human falls. We conducted experiments in our RiSH testbed to evaluate auditory perception services, human body activity recognition, human position tracking, sound-based human activity monitoring, and fall detection and rescue. Twelve human subjects were asked to conduct daily activities in the testbed and mimic falls. All data of their movement, body activities, and sound events were collected by the robot. Human trajectories were estimated with a root mean square error of less than 0.2 m. The robot was able to recognize 37 human activities through sound events with an average accuracy of 88% and detect falling sounds with an accuracy of 80% at the frame level. The experiments show the operation of the various components in the RiSH and the capabilities of the home service robot in monitoring and assisting the resident.",

There is a critical need for public health interventions to support the independence of older adults as the world's population ages. Health smart homes (HSH) and home-based consumer health (HCH) technologies may play a role in these interventions.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of HSH and HCH literature from indexed repositories for health care and technology disciplines (e.g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore) and classified included studies according to an evidence-based public health (EBPH) typology.
Results
One thousand, six hundred and thirty-nine candidate articles were identified. Thirty-one studies from the years 1998–2011 were included. Twenty-one included studies were classified as emerging, 10 as promising and 3 as effective (first tier).
Conclusion
The majority of included studies were published in the period beginning in the year 2005. All 3 effective (first tier) studies and 9 of 10 of promising studies were published during this period. Almost all studies included an activity sensing component and most of them used passive infrared motion sensors. The three effective (first tier) studies all used a multicomponent technology approach that included activity sensing, reminders and other technologies tailored to individual preferences. Future research should explore the use of technology for self-management of health by older adults; social support; and self-reported health measures incorporated into personal health records, electronic medical records, and community health registries.",

To report on the results of a review concerning the use of mobile phones for health with older adults.
Methods
PubMed and CINAHL were searched for articles using “older adults” and “mobile phones” along with related terms and synonyms between 1965 and June 2012. Identified articles were filtered by the following inclusion criteria: original research project utilizing a mobile phone as an intervention, involve/target adults 60years of age or older, and have an aim emphasizing the mobile phone’s use in health.
Results
Twenty-one different articles were found and categorized into ten different clinical domains, including diabetes, activities of daily life, and dementia care, among others. The largest group of articles focused on diabetes care (4 articles), followed by COPD (3 articles), Alzheimer’s/dementia Care (3 articles) and osteoarthritis (3 articles). Areas of interest studied included feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. While there were many different clinical domains, the majority of studies were pilot studies that needed more work to establish a stronger base of evidence.
Conclusions
Current work in using mobile phones for older adult use are spread across a variety of clinical domains. While this work is promising, current studies are generally smaller feasibility studies, and thus future work is needed to establish more generalizable, stronger base of evidence for effectiveness of these interventions.",

abstract = "For more than a decade, the Smart Home has promised to offer a better quality of life by connecting in-house devices and monitoring their usage. Such platform-based configurational technology has demonstrated the potential to improve comfort, healthcare, safety and security, and energy conservation — both at home and in the office. Moreover, since these technologies foster users' independence, Smart Homes can be both an answer to an aging workforce and a large market for an aging customer base. Nonetheless, so far market adoption has mostly been limited to the luxury segment and the more basic stand-alone technologies. Therefore, the main question driving this study is why Smart Home technology is so scarcely implemented despite its benefits to an aging population. From the literature we derive key market barriers in Smart Home value networks. We expand on these findings by means of a value network analysis of a Dutch smart home implementation case. In addition, we conducted 14 interviews that provide more insight into the value network of specific Smart Home services. Based on our case findings we develop a generic value network for Smart Homes and propose opportunities to improve market adoption of Smart Home technologies.",

A caregiver must assess the well being of residents and report to the medical staff if there is something unusual with a resident. Deviations from the routine will trigger an alarm, and automatic tools can help in making timely decisions. In this paper, we explore three visualization metaphors aiming at providing caregivers with an individualized overview of the activities carried out by residents in a given time frame. We postulate that this overview is sufficient to distinguish between normal and abnormal periods of time when visually compared in groups. We also present two automated approaches, data driven and knowledge driven respectively, to detect abnormalities. The visualization and the automated approaches are tested on a naturalistic dataset obtained from a long-term personalized sensing and annotation campaign in a residence for geriatric patients. Data is of two types, obtained from IoT infrastructure and wearables and from manual annotations made by the staff. Both approaches were empirically evaluated and validated in the paper. A side product of this research is a large repository of cleansed data from the sensing and annotation campaign for 45 older adults over a period of 39 months.",

Understanding accessibility to screening and treatment facilities for older adults is necessary in order to provide them with preventive and restorative services. This study uses an agent-based model to examine the accessibility of screening and treatment facilities via transportation networks for older adults living in the neighborhoods of northern Manhattan, New York City. Older adults are simulated as socioeconomically distinct agents who move along a GIS-based transportation network using transportation modes that mediate their access to screening and treatment facilities. This simulation model includes four types of mobile agents as a simplifying assumption: walk, by car, by bus, or by van (i.e., a form of transportation assistance for older adults). These mobile agents follow particular routes: older adults who travel by car, bus, and van follow street roads, whereas pedestrians follow walkways. The model enables the user to focus on one neighborhood at a time for analysis. The spatial dimension of an older adult's accessibility to screening and treatment facilities is simulated through the travel costs (indicated by travel time or distance) incurred in the GIS-based model environment, where lower travel costs to screening and treatment facilities imply better access. This model provides a framework for representing health-seeking behavior that is contextualized by a transportation network in a GIS environment.",

Technological advances are leading to the ability to autonomously monitor patient's health status in their own homes, to enable aging-in-place.
Objectives
To understand the perceptions of seniors with heart failure (HF) regarding smart-home systems to monitor their physiological parameters.
Methods
In this qualitative study, HF outpatients were invited to a smart-home lab, where they completed a sequence of activities, during which the capacity of 5 autonomous sensing modalities was compared to gold standard measures. Afterwards, a semi-structured interview was undertaken. These were transcribed and analyzed using an interpretive-descriptive approach.
Results
Five themes emerged from the 26 interviews: (1) perceptions of technology, (2) perceived benefits of autonomous health monitoring, (3) disadvantages of autonomous monitoring, (4) lack of perceived need for continuous health monitoring, and (5) preferences for autonomous monitoring.
Conclusions
Patient perception towards autonomous monitoring devices was positive, lending credence to zero-effort technology as a viable and promising approach.",

In general such systems assume that only a single person (the resident) is present in the home. However, in real world environments, it is common to have visits and it is crucial to know when the resident is alone or not. We deal with this challenge by presenting a novel method that models regular activity patterns and detects visits. Our method is based on the Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP), but is extended to allow the incorporation of multiple feature streams. The results from the experiments on nine months of sensor data collected in two apartments show that our model significantly outperforms the standard MMPP. We validate the generalisation of the model using two new data sets collected from an other sensor network.",

In addition to providing valuable activity information, activity segmentation also can be used to improve the performance of activity recognition. We evaluate our proposed segmentation-enhanced activity recognition method on data collected from 29 smart homes. Results of this analysis indicate that the method not only provides useful information about activity boundaries and transitions between activities but also increases recognition accuracy by 7.59% and f measure by 6.69% in comparison with the traditional window-based methods.",

This paper presents a survey reviewing research surrounding the emergent field of Social Network Services (SNSs), along with other meaningful social applications, and its use by the older segment of the population. A total of thirteen domains are identified related with how these services can be improved to consider older adults characteristics: from the most important related with the family role and privacy control, to issues related with the design of the user interface, the importance of multimodal interaction and adaptive solutions to compensate age-related declines, to several other focusing on the importance of groups, photos, cultural and health information. Main contributions to the field of SNS and older adults are given in a set of recommendations which result from discussions on each domain and which aim at the design of a more inclusive SNS solution.",

A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects.

For example, monitoring people with dementia using commercially available devices that measure heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and activity level could be used to predict episodic behavioral and psychological symptoms before they become distressing or disruptive. However, since these devices are designed primarily for fitness assessment, validation of the sensors in a controlled environment with the target cohort population is needed. In this study, we present validation results using a commercial fitness tracker, the Hexoskin sensor vest, with thirty-one participants aged 65 and older. Estimated physiological measures investigated in this study are heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and activity level of the participants. Findings indicate that while the processed step count, heart rate, and breathing rate show strong correlations to the clinically accepted gold standard values, lung volume and activity level do not. This indicates the need to proceed cautiously when making clinical decisions using such sensors, and suggests that users should focus on the three strongly correlated parameters for further analysis, at least in the older population. The use of physiological measurement devices such as the Hexoskin may eventually become a non-intrusive way to continuously assess physiological measures in older adults with dementia who are at risk for distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms.",

abstract = "Diversification of application areas, technologies, and computational techniques in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain alongside the need for a balance between reproducibility and customizability for the heterogeneous end-user groups has led towards the development of domain-specific middleware platforms, which are software frameworks that facilitate integration and communication amongst heterogeneous hardware and software components, so they can operate synergistically within a shared environment. Recent efforts that study such platforms have emphasized the need for improved evaluation methods, particularly feature-focused scenario-based evaluations. Thus, the objective of this work was to perform a comparative analysis of two prominent AAL middleware platforms and their programmability for Older Adults with Dementia (OAwD) to ultimately derive guidelines for the development of AAL systems. Mapping of a platform-independence use-case scenario to both platforms, hinted towards the need for graphical-user interfaces over text-based interfaces and application area-specific modules.",

Participants reported using a wide variety of technology items, particularly in their homes. Positive attitudes (i.e., likes) outnumbered negative attitudes (i.e., dislikes), suggesting that older adults perceive the benefits of technology use to outweigh the costs of such use. Positive attitudes were most frequently related to how the technology supported activities, enhanced convenience, and contained useful features. Negative attitudes were most frequently associated with technology creating inconveniences, unhelpful features, as well as security and reliability concerns. Given that older adults reported more positive than negative attitudes about the technologies they use, these results contradict stereotypes that older adults are afraid or unwilling to use technology. These findings also highlight the importance of perceived benefits of use and ease of use for models of technology acceptance. Emphasizing the benefits of technology in education and training programs may increase future technology adoption.",

Specifically, we statistically analyze the relationship between various walkability indices (centrality, betweenness, angularity, etc.) evaluated by road network data, and pedestrian movement estimated by mobile GPS data in the six main wards in Tokyo, Japan. The result suggests the usefulness of our approach for low-carbon smart community design rousing people’s walking activity. The walkability results and data are then compared to the results of a macrosimulation traffic model for the Sumida Ward of Tokyo to understand the impact that walkability may have on emissions if built environment conditions are improved in favor of a lesser automobile mode share.",

Context-aware software systems can interact with different devices to complete their tasks and act according to the context, regardless of their development and organizational differences. Interoperability is a big challenge in the engineering of such systems.
Objective
To discuss how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems, strengthening the scientific basis for its understanding and conceptualization.
Method
A quasi-systematic literature review was undertaken to observe interoperability in such context-aware software systems to support the discussions. Its dataset includes 17 from 408 papers identified in the technical literature. The extracted information was qualitatively analyzed by following the principles of Grounded Theory.
Results
The analysis allowed to identify ten interoperability concepts, organized into a Theoretical Framework according to structural and behavioral perspectives, which deals with interoperability as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage interaction with a system) to interact for a particular purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome. Once the interoperability is established from structural concepts (context, perspective, purpose, the level of provided support and system attributes), it can be measured, improved and observed from the behavioral concepts (evaluation method, challenges, issues, and benefits).
Conclusions
The Interoperability Theoretical Framework provides relevant information to organize the knowledge related to interoperability, considering context, and can be used to guide the evolution of software systems regarding changes focused on interoperability.",

abstract = "Background
Numerous studies have attempted to identify predictors of institutionalization in the general population. Gender studies have led to inconsistent results. Some authors argued that older women were more likely than older men to use long-term care services, while others failed to highlight a specific gender effect on the use of long-term care services. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gender on the preferences of older citizens for long-term care using a panel of disability situations.
Methods
We used a set of ten vignettes displaying disability situations with or without an able-bodied spouse present and used a population-based survey to inquire about appropriate long-term care. Participants were 3102 community-dwelling persons aged 68–83 years included in the representative Lausanne cohort 65+ study in January 2017. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to explore the effect of gender on long-term care choices by older men and women, controlling for the respondent's age and living arrangement.
Results
The respondents’ choices shifted toward institutionalization when the disorder severity increased in vignettes and when there was no spouse able to help. Men were more likely to choose a home setting with caregiving only by spouse even when the level of disability increased. Women chose help from professionals, sheltered homes, or institutionalization more quickly than men.
Conclusions
Exploring gender preferences for long-term care arrangements is critical for improving and planning long-term care services.",

Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision). The survey also covers data fusion in the domains of emotion recognition and general-health and introduce relevant directions and challenges of future research on multi-sensor fusion in the BSN domain.",

Stationary aspect of sensors used in most smart homes makes the concept difficult to deploy in existing homes, and involves a high cost. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive non-vision-based system ably to recognize, in real-time, activities and errors of a resident. This proposed recognition system is based on a shoe equipped with a single sensor: a three-axis accelerometer and on a state- transition algorithmic approach using fuzzy logic. We have examined the learning data as frequency distributions, where the probability histograms have been directly interpreted as fuzzy set. We conducted experiments of the system in our smart home by simulating (multiple times) several scenarios based on a morning routine. These scenarios were based on clinical data gathered in a previous experiment with actual Alzheimer's patients. We obtained promising results showing that the proposed activity and error recognition system are highly effective.",

Objective
In this paper we report the results of a usability and user experience (UX) assessment of the WIISEL system in multiple countries and thus establish whether the UCD process carried out in Ireland produced positive usability and UX results outside of Ireland.
Methods
15 older adults across three centres (Ireland, Italy and Israel) were recruited for a three-day trial of the system in their home. Usability and UX data were captured using observations, interviews and usability questionnaires.
Results
The system was satisfactory in terms of the usability and UX feedback from the participants in all three countries. There was no statistically significant difference in the usability scores for the three countries tested, with the exception of comfort.
Conclusions
A connected health system designed using a UCD process in a single country resulted in positive usability and UX for users in other European countries.",

The number of older people is increasing rapidly and these demographical changes put a large stress on the health care system. Furthermore, as most older people wish to age-in-place, adequate ageing-in-place strategies become significantly important. Housing impacts health, therefore appropriate and comfortable housing is a key determinant to facilitate older people to age-in-place. One of the aspects of concern is thermal comfort; however, the thermal requirements of older people differ from those of young adults. They are also relatively vulnerable to thermal conditions outside the generally accepted range. This ’10 Questions' contribution addresses issues related to thermal comfort and ageing and argues that the current models for assessing thermal comfort are not sufficiently accurate to be used for older adults. It also discusses approaches to facilitate ageing-in-place including the use of smart home technologies. The paper is based on extensive literature review of numerous relevant studies relating to thermal comfort, physiological differences between older and younger people, the relationship between thermal environment, comfort and health, as well as housing design and smart home technologies for older people.",

Exercise (particularly progressive resistance training) and nutrition are key strategies in preventing and reversing declines in muscle mass, strength and power during ageing, but many sarcopenic older adults fail to meet recommended levels of both physical activity and dietary nutrient intake. Assistive technology (AT) describes devices or systems used to maintain or improve physical functioning. These may help sarcopenic older adults to maintain independence, and also to achieve adequate physical activity and nutrition. There is a paucity of research exploring the use of AT in sarcopenic patients, but there is evidence that AT, including walking aids, may reduce functional decline in other populations with disability. Newer technologies, such as interactive and virtual reality games, as well as wearable devices and smartphone applications, smart homes, 3D printed foods, exoskeletons and robotics, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation also hold promise for improving engagement in physical activity and nutrition behaviours to prevent further functional declines. While AT may be beneficial for sarcopenic patients, clinicians should be aware of its potential limitations. In particular, there are high rates of patient abandonment of AT, which may be minimised by appropriate training and monitoring of use. Clinicians should preferentially prescribe AT devices which promote physical activity. Further research is required in sarcopenic populations to identify strategies for effective use of current and emerging AT devices.",

abstract = "Background
The healthcare system faces a major challenge in caring for an increasingly ageing population as this task requires more resources than are currently available. Adopting monitoring technologies could enable more efficient care practices and support ageing in place.
Objectives
To investigate how the use of an in-home motion monitoring system can be integrated into home care nurses’ workflows and to uncover the factors behind system adoption.
Design
A single case study adopting a qualitative approach.
Setting
A home care unit serving older adults living in independent living residences within an apartment complex.
Method
Multiple data collection methods were used including individual and group interviews, a questionnaire with open-ended questions, evaluation probes, and system log data. The qualitative material was analysed using a stepwise-deductive inductive approach.
Results
A central factor behind system adoption was the perceived usefulness of gaining information about older adults’ night-time activities. In particular, monitoring older adults suffering from memory disorders was considered advantageous. The information that the system provided supported nurses in health assessments and assisted in adjusting care decisions. Previous negative experiences with similar technologies initially influenced the time for adoption. Further, although nurses were closely involved in the system design process, they took some time to get acquainted with the system and to integrate its use into daily practice. System reliability and accuracy issues influenced nurses’ trust in the sensory data.
Conclusion
The findings suggests that in a home care setting, focusing on motion pattern monitoring for older adults with memory disorders can provide significant benefits and therefore also facilitate system adoption among nurses. Involving nurses in the design of the technology and providing opportunities to trial the system in real practice also appear to be important in achieving system adoption.",

abstract = "Background
The world population is ageing rapidly with the percentage of older adults increasing to 24% by 2030 from 10% in 2000. Therefore cost of providing aged care has been growing, especially in countries such as Japan, the USA and Australia. For example, the average need for long-term care was estimated at three years for people turning 65 in United States of America at 2005 (Kemper, Komisar, & Alecxih, 2005). Robotic technology has been identified as being able to help older adults to live independently, and is emerging as an innovative approach to assist older adults directly, for example, robotic wheelchairs and indirectly for instance providing support to stakeholders, including caregivers. This study looks at the research undertaken in robotic technologies as it is applied to aged care.
Method
A systematic literature review of peer-reviewed literature published in Medline, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and SpringerLINK, from 1 January 2000 to mid-July 2015 was undertaken.
Results
An initial set of 8533 studies was refined to 58 studies. Nine robot types were identified in addressing aged care problems, including companion, manipulator service, telepresence, rehabilitation, health monitoring, reminder, entertainment, domestic, and fall detection/prevention robots. These robot types have been applied to eight key problem areas in aged care, namely social isolation, dependent living, physical or cognitive impairment, mobility problems, poor health monitoring, lack of recreation, memory problems and fall problems. The frequency of research into each robot type was analysed, with the finding some robotic technologies have received more attention (e.g., companion) while other types that can assist older adults with independent living (e.g., cooking and bathing) were not as comprehensively researched.
Conclusion
This literature review examines research into robots and how they can help in aged care with nine categories of robot identified. The literature establishes that some types of robots have gained significant attention from researchers with respect to their application in various problem areas while other robot types have not. The purpose of this paper is to review the studies and identify current outcomes.",

We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment.

abstract = "Background
Wearable sensors (wearables) have been commonly integrated into a wide variety of commercial products and are increasingly being used to collect and process raw physiological parameters into salient digital health information. The data collected by wearables are currently being investigated across a broad set of clinical domains and patient populations. There is significant research occurring in the domain of algorithm development, with the aim of translating raw sensor data into fitness- or health-related outcomes of interest for users, patients, and health-care providers.
Objectives
The aim of this review is to highlight a selected group of fitness- and health-related indicators from wearables data and to describe several algorithmic approaches used to generate these higher order indicators.
Methods
A systematic search of the PubMed database was performed with the following search terms (number of records in parentheses): Fitbit algorithm (18), Apple Watch algorithm (3), Garmin algorithm (5), Microsoft Band algorithm (8), Samsung Gear algorithm (2), Xiaomi MiBand algorithm (1), Huawei Band (Watch) algorithm (2), photoplethysmography algorithm (465), accelerometry algorithm (966), electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm (8287), and continuous glucose monitor algorithm (343). The search terms chosen for this review are focused on algorithms for wearable devices that dominated the commercial wearables market between 2014 and 2017 and that were highly represented in the biomedical literature. A second set of search terms included categories of algorithms for fitness-related and health-related indicators that are commonly used in wearable devices (e.g. accelerometry, PPG, ECG). These articles covered the following domain areas: fitness; exercise; movement; physical activity; step count; walking; running; swimming; energy expenditure; atrial fibrillation; arrhythmia; cardiovascular; autonomic nervous system; neuropathy; heart rate variability; fall detection; trauma; behavior change; diet; eating; stress detection; serum glucose monitoring; continuous glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus type 1; and diabetes mellitus type 2. All studies uncovered through this search on commercially available device algorithms and pivotal studies on sensor algorithm development were summarized, and a summary table was constructed using references generated by the literature review as described (Table 1).
Conclusions
Wearable health technologies aim to collect and process raw physiological or environmental parameters into salient digital health information. Much of the current and future utility of wearables lies in the signal processing steps and algorithms used to analyze large volumes of data. Continued algorithmic development and advances in machine learning techniques will further increase analytic capabilities. In the context of these advances, our review aims to highlight a range of advances in fitness- and other health-related indicators provided by current wearable technologies.",

abstract = "Background
Over recent years a number of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have emerged aiming at falls prevention, falls detection and alarms for use in case of fall. There are also a range of ICT interventions, which have been created or adapted to be pro-active in preventing falls, such as those which provide strength and balance training to older adults in the prevention of falls. However, there are issues related to the adoption and continued use of these technologies by older adults.
Objectives
This review provides an overview of older adults’ perceptions of falls technologies.
Methods
We undertook systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychINFO, COMPENDEX and the Cochrane database. Key search terms included ‘older adults’, ‘seniors’, ‘preference’, ‘attitudes’ and a wide range of technologies, they also included the key word ‘fall*’. We considered all studies that included older adults aged 50 and above. Studies had to include technologies related specifically to falls prevention, detection or monitoring. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies by the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) were used.
Results
We identified 76 potentially relevant papers. Some 21 studies were considered for quality review. Twelve qualitative studies, three quantitative studies and 6 mixed methods studies were included. The literature related to technologies aimed at predicting, monitoring and preventing falls suggest that intrinsic factors related to older adults’ attitudes around control, independence and perceived need/requirements for safety are important for their motivation to use and continue using technologies. Extrinsic factors such as usability, feedback gained and costs are important elements which support these attitudes and perceptions.
Conclusion
Positive messages about the benefits of falls technologies for promoting healthy active ageing and independence are critical, as is ensuring that the technologies are simple, reliable and effective and tailored to individual need. The technologies need to be clearly described in research and older peoples’ attitudes towards different sorts of technologies must be clarified if specific recommendations are to be made.",

Smart watches have the potential to support health in everyday living by: enabling self-monitoring of personal activity; obtaining feedback based on activity measures; allowing for in-situ surveys to identify patterns of behavior; and supporting bi-directional communication with health care providers and family members. However, smart watches are an emerging technology and research with these devices is at a nascent stage.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of smart watch studies that engaged people in their use by searching PubMed, Embase, IEEE XPlore and ACM Digital libraries. Participant demographics, device features, watch applications and methods, and technical challenges were abstracted from included studies.
Results
Seventy-three studies were returned in the search. Seventeen studies published were included. Included studies were published from 2014 to 2016, with the exception of one published in 2011. Most studies employed the use of consumer-grade smart watches (14/17, 82%). Patient-related studies focused on activity monitoring, heart rate monitoring, speech therapy adherence, diabetes self-management, and detection of seizures, tremors, scratching, eating, and medication-taking behaviors. Most patient-related studies enrolled participants with few exclusion criteria to validate smart watch function (10/17, 58%). Only studies that focused on Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and diabetes management enrolled persons living with targeted conditions. One study focused on nursing work in the ICU and one focused on CPR training for laypeople.
Conclusion
Consumer-grade smart watches have penetrated the health research space rapidly since 2014. Smart watch technical function, acceptability, and effectiveness in supporting health must be validated in larger field studies that enroll actual participants living with the conditions these devices target.",

abstract = "Background
Falls are a serious health problem in old adults especially in nursing home residents and hospitalized patients. To prevent elderly from falling, sensors have been increasingly used in intramural care settings. However, there is no clear overview of the current used technologies and their results in fall prevention.
Objectives
The present study reviews sensor systems that prevent falls in geriatric patients living in an intramural setting and describe fall rates, fall-related injuries, false alarms, and user experience associated with such systems.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search for studies that used sensor technologies with the aim to prevent falls in institutionalized geriatric patients.
Results
A total of 12 studies met the search criteria. Three randomized clinical trials reported no reductions in fall rate but three before–after studies reported significant reductions of 2.4–37 falls per 1000 patient days. Although there was up to 77% reduction in fall-related injuries and there was relatively low, 16%, rate of false alarms, the current data are inconsistent whether current sensor technologies are effective in reducing the number of falls in institutionalized geriatric patients. The occurrence of false alarms (16%) was too high to maintain full attention of the nursing staff. Additionally including the users opinion and demands in developing and introducing sensor systems into intramural care settings seems to be required to make an intervention successful.
Conclusion
The evidence is inconsistent whether the current sensor systems can prevent falls and fall-related injuries in institutionalized elderly. Further research should focus more comprehensively on user requirements and effective ways using intelligent alarms.",

abstract = "Background
Globally, populations are aging with increasing life spans. The normal aging process and the resulting disabilities increase fall risks. Falls are an important cause of injury, loss of independence and institutionalization. Technologies have been developed to detect falls and reduce their consequences but their use and impact on quality of life remain debatable. Reviews on fall detection technologies exist but are not extensive. A comprehensive literature review on the state of knowledge of fall detection technologies can inform research, practice, and user adoption.
Objectives
To examine the extent and the diversity of current technologies for fall detection in older adults.
Methods
A scoping review design was used to search peer-reviewed literature on technologies to detect falls, published in English, French or Spanish since 2006. Data from the studies were analyzed descriptively.
Results
The literature search identified 3202 studies of which 118 were included for analysis. Ten types of technologies were identified ranging from wearable (e.g., inertial sensors) to ambient sensors (e.g., vision sensors). Their Technology Readiness Level was low (mean 4.54 SD 1.25; 95% CI [4.31, 4.77] out of a maximum of 9). Outcomes were typically evaluated on technological basis and in controlled environments. Few were evaluated in home settings or care units with older adults. Acceptability, implementation cost and barriers were seldom addressed.
Conclusions
Further research should focus on increasing Technology Readiness Levels of fall detection technologies by testing them in real-life settings with older adults.",

abstract = "Introduction
As the fraction of the population with chronic diseases continues to grow, methods and/or technologies must be found to help the chronically ill to take more responsibility to self-manage their illnesses. Internet based and/or mobile support for disease self-management interventions have often proved effective, but patients with chronic illnesses may have co-occurring cognitive impairment, making it more difficult for them to cope with technologies. Many older patients are also not familiar with technologies or they may have cognitive disabilities or dementia that reduce their ability to self-manage their healthcare. On-line solutions to the needs of chronically ill patients must be investigated and acted upon with care in an integrated manner, since resources invested in these solutions will be lost if patients do not adopt and continue to use them successfully.
Objectives
To review the capabilities of online and mobile support for self-management of chronic illnesses, and the impacts that age and disease-related issues have on these interventions, including cognitive impairment and lack of access or familiarity with Internet or mobile technologies.
Methods
This study includes a review of the co-occurrence of cognitive impairment with chronic diseases, and discusses how cognitive impairment, dyadic caregiver patient support, patient efficacy with technology, and smart home technologies can impact the effectiveness and sustainability of online support for disease self-management.
Results
Disease self-management interventions (SMIs) using online patient centered support can often enable patients to manage their own chronic illnesses. However, our findings show that cognitive impairment often co-occurs in patients with chronic disease. This, along with age-related increases in multiple chronic illnesses and lack of technology efficacy, can be obstacles to Internet and mobile support for chronic disease self-management.
Conclusion
Patients with chronic diseases may have greater than expected difficulties in using Internet and mobile technologies for disease self-management, often due to cognitive impairment or unfamiliarity with technology. Approaches to dealing with such barriers include suitable integration of solutions involving patient–caregiver dyads, better design of online applications, careful attention to technology adoption and sustainability, and smart home technologies.",

Results
Elderly people approach the Internet and health information technology differently than younger people, but have growing rates of adoption. Assistive technology, such as sensors or home monitors, may help ‘aging in place’, but these have not been thoroughly evaluated. Elders face many barriers in using technology for healthcare decision-making, including issues with familiarity, willingness to ask for help, trust of the technology, privacy, and design challenges.
Conclusions
Barriers must be addressed for these tools to be available to this growing population. Design, education, research, and policy all play roles in addressing these barriers to acceptance and use.",

abstract = "Background/Purpose
Quantitative analysis of daily activities measured by home monitoring systems can be helpful to assess objectively the health-related living behavior and functional ability of older adults. Advances in sensors and telecommunication technologies have prompted the concept and development of implementing diverse sensors and intelligent algorithms to monitor human/environment interactions. This paper presents the remote monitoring and assessment of daily activities of older adults living alone at home, assuming that comprehensive profiles of daily activities at home can be captured by using simple and low-cost sensors in a less diverse modality.
Methods
A passive home monitoring system with a minimal set of sensing modalities, namely human infrared and electric current, was developed and used for continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of daily activities of an elderly woman for over 6 months. Four movement detectors were deployed in different indoor locations to detect active movements, and an appliance usage detector detected television use. A set of activity features that measure the intensity, regularity and abnormalities of activity patterns is defined and demonstrated to quantify the characteristics and rhythms of daily activities of the subject.
Results
Different rhythms of daily activities can be estimated from different locations at home, and distinct behaviors were shown between weekdays and holidays. Unusual activities have been detected by the system, too. The system setup did not require modification of home furnishings that could obstruct the subject's daily living or cause any discomfort or displeasure to the subject.
Conclusion
This study suggests that daily activities of an older adult living alone at home can be measured by means of low-cost sensors in a less-diverse sensor modality, and daily rhythms can be quantified with a simple estimation method. The activity features developed in this study are built into a home telehealth system for telecare applications.",

Aging in place (AIP), continuing to live in the same or familiar place or community for as long as possible not only fulfills a neoliberal and economic imperative but aligns with the wishes of a majority of older Canadians, who prefer to age in place. Despite policies' contributions to differing experiences of aging, the potential bearing of the narratives embedded within AIP or age-friendly policies remains unexamined. Within an institutional ethnography method of inquiry, this study applied Bacchi's “What's the Problem Represented to be?” (WPR) approach to structure the discovery of governing narratives about familial care work embedded within seven Canadian aging in place policies at the municipal, provincial, and federal level. I analyzed these policies for their role in coordinating the experiences of caring for an older adult who is aging in place in London, Canada's first age-friendly city. Of particular interest for this study is uncovering whether these texts recognize the work, and in particular the information work, of providing care to an older adult who is AIP. The policies' overall focus on self-reliance, independence, and resourcefulness frames aging in place as a process that can and should be responsibly managed. Information is introduced as a helpful tool to secure and preserve older adults' independence and usefulness to their community. The policies' problematizations frame successful aging in place as governed through a logic of choice, where a complex problem is framed as a matter of choice. Ultimately, however, while the policies offer a number of different “choices” for older adults to AIP, a critical unpacking of the problematizations reveals the choice to AIP to be illusory. There is only one option presented in the policies and that is to AIP.",

abstract = "Most older persons (age 65 and over) in the United States occupy suburban residential areas. Distinguishing where the older population lives is important because critics argue that the built environments of their suburban communities make it difficult for them to age in place successfully, that is, to have healthy, independent, active, and enjoyable lives. They point to their low population and building densities, long distances separating their residences from services, amenities, and commercial areas, and few transit and walking options. Consequently, when the mobility limitations of older residents prevent them from safely driving their vehicles, they have difficulties reaching destinations outside their homes (mobility behaviors) to satisfy their discretionary and obligatory needs. This paper questions this suburban bashing. It argues that future cohorts of older people, especially women, will be more able to drive, cars will be technologically safer and easier to operate, and ride-sharing options will be more available. More suburbs will also have mixed-use and pedestrian-accessible built environments reducing the need for vehicular travel. Most importantly, the information, activities, goods, services, and care required by older people to age in place will be delivered to their dwellings. Home sharing, home care, internet connectivity, e-commerce, social media, smart homes, telemedicine and robotic technologies will make the mobility or out-of-home behaviors of older residents less necessary. The paper introduces the constructs of connectivity options and connectivity behaviors to encompass these expanded travel and in-home delivery strategies. These new ways of connecting with their environments will result in more self-reliant older persons who are less constrained by their mobility limitations. These conclusions offer insights for planners and policymakers seeking to make their suburban communities more age-friendly. They must keep pace with the changing ways that older people will access their environments if they are to improve the quality of their lives and help them to age in place successfully.",

The results show that the most significant intelligent values embodied in smart houses embrace technologies of the functional automation. In fact, smart houses are substantially intertwined with integrated ICT technologies which aim to ensure comfortable living environments. Despite the identified challenges, the proliferation of smart houses into urban areas requires an integration of them in the city for creating intelligent environments. As a result, the promotion and integration of smart houses with other smarter elements of cities could archive a significant enhancement of the quality of life and a stronger urban sustainability.",

Specifically, we describe a method to learn activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) in order to study the behavior patterns of older adults to detect health changes. To learn the ADLs, we incorporate scene information to provide contextual information to build our activity model. The strength of our algorithm lies in its generalizability to model different ADLs while adding more information to the model as we instantiate ADLs from learned activity states. We validate our results in a controlled environment and compare it with another widely accepted classifier, the hidden Markov model (HMM) and its variations. We also test our system on depth data collected in a dynamic unstructured environment at TigerPlace, an independent living facility for older adults. An in-home activity monitoring system would benefit from our algorithm to alert healthcare providers of significant temporal changes in ADL behavior patterns of frail older adults for fall risk, cognitive impairment, and other health changes.",

However, elderly people may suffer from the consequences of cognitive decline, which is a mental health disorder that primarily affects cognitive abilities such as learning, memory, etc. As a result, the elderly people may get dependent on caregivers to complete daily life tasks. Detecting the early indicators of dementia before it gets worsen and warning the caregivers and medical doctors would be helpful for further diagnosis. In this paper, the problem of activity recognition and abnormal behaviour detection is investigated for elderly people with dementia. First of all, the paper presents a methodology for generating synthetic data reflecting on some behavioural difficulties of people with dementia given the difficulty of obtaining real-world data. Secondly, the paper explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to model patterns in activity sequences and detect abnormal behaviour related to dementia. Activity recognition is considered as a sequence labelling problem, while abnormal behaviour is flagged based on the deviation from normal patterns. Moreover, the performance of CNNs is compared against the state-of-art methods such as Naïve Bayes (NB), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The results obtained indicate that CNNs are competitive with those state-of-art methods.",

The reduction of costs influences technology acceptability; thus innovation by using cheaper computer systems and sensors is relevant and should be taken into account in the implementation of robotic systems.",

In this work, we present a systematic review concerning the recent enabling technologies as a tool to the diagnosis, treatment and better quality of life of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD), as well as an analysis of future trends on new approaches to this end.
Methods
In this review, we compile a number of works published at some well-established databases, such as Science Direct, IEEEXplore, PubMed, Plos One, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Springer and Hindawi Publishing Corporation. Each selected work has been carefully analyzed in order to identify its objective, methodology and results.
Results
The review showed the majority of works make use of signal-based data, which are often acquired by means of sensors. Also, we have observed the increasing number of works that employ virtual reality and e-health monitoring systems to increase the life quality of PD patients. Despite the different approaches found in the literature, almost all of them make use of some sort of machine learning mechanism to aid the automatic PD diagnosis.
Conclusions
The main focus of this survey is to consider computer-assisted diagnosis, and how effective they can be when handling the problem of PD identification. Also, the main contribution of this review is to consider very recent works only, mainly from 2015 and 2016.",

With the increase in the population of older adults around the world, a significant amount of work has been done on in-home sensor technology to aid the elderly age independently. However, due to the large amounts of data generated by the sensors, it takes a lot of effort and time for the clinicians to makes sense of this data. In this work, we develop a system to help make this data more useful by presenting it in the form of natural language.
Methods
We start by identifying important attributes in the sensor data that are relevant to the health of the elderly. We then develop algorithms to extract these important health related features from the sensor parameters and summarize them in natural language. We focus on making the natural language summaries to be informative, accurate and concise.
Results
We designed multiple surveys using real and synthetic data to validate the summaries produced by our algorithms. We show that the algorithms produce meaningful results comparable to human subjects. We also implemented our linguistic summarization system to produce summaries of data leading to health alerts derived from the sensor data. The system is running live in 110 apartments currently. By the means of retrospective case studies, we illustrate that the linguistic summaries are able to make the connection between changes in the sensor data and the health of the elderly.
Conclusions
We present a system that extracts important clinically relevant features from in-home sensor data generated in the apartments of the elderly and summarize those features in natural language. The preliminary testing of our summarization system shows that it has the potential to help the clinicians utilize this data effectively.",

The current and upcoming demographic change in industrial countries is a challenge for our society, economically as well as socially. The aim of this article is to explore the influences of information and communication technologies applied to contribute to these trends and describe its impact to the quality of life and subjective health of elderly.
Methods
In a structured literature review on (a) scientific publications and (b) outcome reports of ambient assisted living projects, we investigated these associations. The results are summarized according to the multidimensional approach of quality of life considering the bio-psycho-social model of health. The project outcomes of current initiatives are consolidated and recommendations for future research in the field of active and assisted living were issued.
Results
Current research efforts show that assistive information and communication technologies can successfully contribute to all dimensions of elderly’s quality of life. As example technologies can empower them to control their health problems, compensate functional disabilities and increase their safety. Otherwise, remote-communication could lead to reduced face-to-face communication and social exclusion.
Conclusion
More research using adequate methods: and instruments is needed to demonstrate the identified effects and to deliver evidence of the impact to the life of the heterogeneous population group of elderly.",

abstract = "Purpose
To identify factors that influence the acceptance of technology for ageing in place by seniors in the post-implementation stage. This review is among very few that focus on acceptance in post-implementation phase.
Methods
A literature review. We searched six databases (Cinahl, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus). Inclusion criteria were: 1) original and peer-reviewed research written in English, 2) Articles published in 2010-2018, 3) Empirical research papers, 4) Research in which participants are seniors aged above 60 years, 5) Research aimed at investigating factors that influence the acceptance of digital technology for ageing in place, 6) Research conducted in home environment, 7) Focus on post-implementation stage.
Results
Twenty-three out of 2281 papers were included. The results show that acceptance of technology in the post-implementation stage is influenced by 36 factors, divided into six themes: concerns/problems regarding technology (technical errors, etc.), experienced positive characteristics of technology (e.g., ease of use factors, privacy implications), expected benefits of technology (e.g., increased safety, companionship, increased security, etc.), need for technology (e.g., perceived need to use), social influence (e.g., influence by peers, family or surroundings) and characteristics of older adults (e.g., past experiences/attitudes, physical environment). The articles considered different types of technology: health monitoring, ADL, safety and communication. The level of technology readiness for digital technologies supporting ageing in place in post-implementation stage is still low within the scientific literature, since only seven out of 23 articles studied mature technologies (TRL 8-9 of the technology readiness level scale). The majority of the studies were conducted in Western Europe or the US, and only two were conducted in other regions (Australia, and Taiwan). Qualitative and quantitative methods were equally used in the analysed articles.
Conclusions
Acceptance of technology in the post-implementation stage is influenced by multiple factors. An interesting finding was that the seniors’ views of technology change between the pre- and post-implementation stages. Some negative concerns that appeared in the pre-implementation stage appear as positive characteristics in the post-implementation stage. In the post-implementation stage, seniors realize the wide variety of benefits that technology can have on their lives. We expect that findings of this review can be utilised by academics and policy-makers for gaining insights for further research and successful implementation of technology for ageing in place.",

We illustrate how the experimental comparison, involving 20 university students and 20 older adults, revealed important differences in UX, including perceived ease of use, behavioral intentions, enjoyment, quality, satisfaction, trust and usability, measured mainly through established questionnaires. Analysis revealed that using that kind of artifacts is a very cost effective way to elicit interesting and useful results; many UX variables are significantly affected by design factors and by age differences, as expected; effects of design factors go well beyond usability and therefore could not be caught by running an investigation focused only on usability. Age difference matters: older adults do not respond to addition of specialists, praises and tooltips as younger users do. We argue that potential benefits of these design choices are outweigh by the increase in complexity of the user interface. From a methodological viewpoint we suggest using a particular array of UX characteristics and metrics when testing mixed-fidelity prototypes. Not all the metrics that we adopted were equally useful, and in particular perceived usability, subjective mental effort, and emotions did not help us highlighting differences.",

abstract = "Background
Steadily increasing numbers of older people and people in need of care represent critical challenges for today’s society. In the last years, diverse (health-related) technologies have been developed to facilitate living at home for older people but also to support (professional) care personnel in their daily care efforts. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have the potential to enhance safety, support medical therapy, or facilitate everyday chores and social life. With the huge range and variety of technical opportunities, the question arises what influences (potential) users’ decisions for the right technology in their individual conditions and situations. In particular with regard to the fragility of the care situation, it is unknown which technologies are desired for different care needs and diverse situations.
Objectives
The present study investigates (1) personal care needs as a potential influencing parameter for technology acceptance and (2) the selection of specific technologies.
Method
In an online questionnaire (including n = 162 people of all ages), technology acceptance and the selection of specific technologies was assessed, using two scenarios differing in their personal care needs (low care needs vs. moderate care needs) in two situational contexts (emergency detection vs. medical reminders).
Results
Personal care needs influence the perception of benefits, barriers, and general acceptance of assisting technologies, independent from situational context. Higher needs for care lead to higher acknowledgements of the technology’s benefits, lower agreements or, in parts, higher rejections of potential barriers and higher acceptance. The two care situations differ regarding the participants’ preferences for technologies: For emergency detection, smart watches and emergency buttons are clearly accepted. In contrast, cameras are consistently rejected. For situations in which medical reminders are used, smartphone and smartwatches are most wanted, whereas audio assistants and smart TV were rather rejected.
Conclusions
The results provide insights into users’ preferences for specific technologies for the purpose of emergency detection and medical reminders as well as for the important influence of personal care needs. These insights can be used to derive user-tailored solutions of technology configurations for specific care needs and situations.",

abstract = "Introduction
Ambient intelligence technologies are a means to support ageing-in-place by monitoring clients in the home. In this study, monitoring is applied for the purpose of raising an alarm in an emergency situation, and thereby, providing an increased sense of safety and security. Apart from these technological solutions, there are numerous environmental interventions in the home environment that can support people to age-in-place. The aim of this study was to investigate the needs and motives, related to ageing-in-place, of the respondents receiving ambient intelligence technologies, and to investigate whether, and how, these technologies contributed to aspects of ageing-in-place.
Methodology
This paper presents the results of a qualitative study comprised of interviews and observations of technology and environmental interventions in the home environment among 18 community-dwelling older adults with a complex demand for care. These respondents had a prototype of the Unattended Autonomous Surveillance system, an example of ambient intelligence technology, installed in their homes as a means to age-in-place. The UAS-system offers a large range of functionalities, including mobility monitoring, voice response, fire detection, as well as wandering detection and prevention, which can be installed in different configurations.
Results
The respondents had various motives to use ambient intelligence technologies to support ageing-in-place. The most prominent reason was to improve the sense of safety and security, in particular, in case of fall incidents, when people were afraid not to be able to use their existing emergency response systems. The ambient intelligence technologies were initially seen as a welcome addition to strategies already adopted by the respondents, including a variety of home modifications and assistive devices. The systems tested increased the sense of safety and security and helped to postpone institutionalisation. Respondents came up with a set of specifications in terms of the operation and the design of the technology. False alarms were also regarded as a sign that the ambient intelligence technology is functioning. Moreover, a good integration of the new technologies in the provision of health care is indispensable, and installation should be done in an acceptable and unobtrusive manner.
Conclusions and implications
Ambient intelligence technologies can contribute to an increased safety and security at home. The technologies alone offer no all encompassing solution as home care and additional environmental interventions are still needed to support ageing-in-place. Results of the study are used to further improve the ambient intelligence technologies and their implementation.",

Automatically detecting and tracking behavior changes from wearable sensor-collected physical activity data can provide a valuable monitoring and motivating tool. In this paper, we formalize the problem of unsupervised physical activity change detection and address the problem with our Physical Activity Change Detection (PACD) approach. PACD is a framework that detects changes between time periods, determines significance of the detected changes, and analyzes the nature of the changes. We compare the abilities of three change detection algorithms from the literature and one proposed algorithm to capture different types of changes as part of PACD. We illustrate and evaluate PACD on synthetic data and using Fitbit data collected from older adults who participated in a health intervention study. Results indicate PACD detects several changes in both datasets. The proposed change algorithms and analysis methods are useful data mining techniques for unsupervised, window-based change detection with potential to track users’ physical activity and motivate progress toward their health goals.",

By inspecting the trends in multiple activities, it is possible to identify and predict human behavioural changes. We refer to the trends in people’s behaviour as behavioural evolution. In this paper, we propose a novel indicator to measure the progressive changes representing a participant’s behavioural evolution. The proposed indicator presents activities as a holistic measure, which first combine multi-activities and then measure the progressive changes in the combined activities for each single day. Real data sets were collected from a wireless sensor network and used to examine our proposed technique. As part of this process, we were able to quantify progressive changes for individual and aggregated activities. Our experimental results demonstrated that: (1) the proposed approach can identify and distinguish normal and abnormal behaviours; (2) large data sets gathered from sensors in an intelligent environment represented in various time series can be visualised in a simple and more understandable format; (3) identifying trends in ADLs or ADWs is a relevant means of sharing information with carers or supervisors.",

We argue that by understanding the relationship between values and technologies in this domain, designers will be in a better position to account for values explicitly, and hence address ethical implications, throughout design. To foster such an understanding, we survey literature on pervasive computing for elderly care, and identify values, technologies and contexts discussed there. We develop a taxonomy to categorize our findings, which serves as a basis to identify and analyze relationships between values, technologies and contexts in pervasive computing for elderly care.

A quantitative study was conducted to probe what voice characteristics of social robots baby boomers may prefer and what personality traits they would associate with various pitch, speech rate, and intonation in Mandarin. While the findings coincide with previous research in that female, extroverted voices were preferred by most participants, many individual differences remain, which could be attributed to differences in demographics, lifestyles, and personality traits. This study contributes to design decisions that would take individual differences into consideration. Social robots that could learn and adapt to people's preferences, perceptions, as well as the tasks at hand may fare better than a one-size-fits-all approach.

abstract = "Purpose
To provide an overview of factors influencing the acceptance of electronic technologies that support aging in place by community-dwelling older adults. Since technology acceptance factors fluctuate over time, a distinction was made between factors in the pre-implementation stage and factors in the post-implementation stage.
Methods
A systematic review of mixed studies. Seven major scientific databases (including MEDLINE, Scopus and CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) original and peer-reviewed research, (2) qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods research, (3) research in which participants are community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older, and (4) research aimed at investigating factors that influence the intention to use or the actual use of electronic technology for aging in place. Three researchers each read the articles and extracted factors.
Results
Sixteen out of 2841 articles were included. Most articles investigated acceptance of technology that enhances safety or provides social interaction. The majority of data was based on qualitative research investigating factors in the pre-implementation stage. Acceptance in this stage is influenced by 27 factors, divided into six themes: concerns regarding technology (e.g., high cost, privacy implications and usability factors); expected benefits of technology (e.g., increased safety and perceived usefulness); need for technology (e.g., perceived need and subjective health status); alternatives to technology (e.g., help by family or spouse), social influence (e.g., influence of family, friends and professional caregivers); and characteristics of older adults (e.g., desire to age in place). When comparing these results to qualitative results on post-implementation acceptance, our analysis showed that some factors are persistent while new factors also emerge. Quantitative results showed that a small number of variables have a significant influence in the pre-implementation stage. Fourteen out of the sixteen included articles did not use an existing technology acceptance framework or model.
Conclusions
Acceptance of technology in the pre-implementation stage is influenced by multiple factors. However, post-implementation research on technology acceptance by community-dwelling older adults is scarce and most of the factors in this review have not been tested by using quantitative methods. Further research is needed to determine if and how the factors in this review are interrelated, and how they relate to existing models of technology acceptance.",

However, this goal faces both technical and ethical issues. In this article we deal with the following: (i) re-definition of cognitive decline and its relationship with frailty definitions, starting from the recent work of international consensus groups for presymptomatic Alzheimer disease recognition; (ii) ethical problems concerning anonymous and personalized cognitive screening and the need for appropriate counselling; (iii) the need for more sensitive and specific tools to detect and distinguish pathological levels of cognitive decline and delineate the contribution of non-pathological decline to accumulated frailty impacts and (iv) the potential of the language domain and spontaneous speech analyses.",

abstract = "Objective
In an ageing world population more citizens are at risk of cognitive impairment, with negative consequences on their ability of independent living, quality of life and sustainability of healthcare systems. Cognitive neuroscience researchers have identified behavioral anomalies that are significant indicators of cognitive decline. A general goal is the design of innovative methods and tools for continuously monitoring the functional abilities of the seniors at risk and reporting the behavioral anomalies to the clinicians. SmartFABER is a pervasive system targeting this objective.
Methods
A non-intrusive sensor network continuously acquires data about the interaction of the senior with the home environment during daily activities. A novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique is used to analyses this data and detect the behavioral anomalies, whose history is presented through a dashboard to the clinicians. Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level.
Results
We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results, including comparisons with other activity recognition techniques, show the effectiveness of SmartFABER in terms of recognition rates.",

Estimates of prevalence and incidence of DAT vary with what is measured, be it change from a baseline cognitive state or a clinical diagnostic endpoint, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Judgment of what is psychometrically “normal” at the age of 80 years implicitly condones a decline from what is normal at the age of 30. However, because cognitive aging is very heterogeneous, it is reasonable to ask “Is ‘normal for age’ good enough to screen for DAT or its earlier precursors of cognitive impairment?” Cost containment and accessibility of ascertainment methods are enhanced by well-validated and reliable methods such as screening for cognitive impairment by telephone interviews. However, focused assessment of episodic memory, the key symptom associated with DAT, might be more effective at distinguishing normal from abnormal cognitive aging trajectories. Alternatively, the futuristic “Smart Home,” outfitted with unobtrusive sensors and data storage devices, permits the moment-to-moment recording of activities so that changes that constitute risk for DAT can be identified before the emergence of symptoms.",

abstract = "A new approach to creating an ensemble of novelty detection algorithms is proposed in this paper. The novelty detection process identifies new or unknown data by detecting if a test data differs significantly from the data available during training. It is applicable for anomaly detection in a situation where there is sufficiently large training data representing the normal class and little or no training data for the anomalous (abnormal) class. Abnormality in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is identified as any significant deviation from an individual’s usual behavioural routine. Novelty detection is relevant to ADL anomaly detection since abnormalities in ADL are rare and data representing the anomalous cases are not readily available. The proposed Consensus Novelty Detection Ensemble approach is based on the concept of internal and external consensus. The internal consensus is an internal voting scheme within each model in the ensemble while the external consensus is an external voting scheme among the ensemble models. The weight of each model is estimated based on its performance and a score, called “Normality Score”. Computed score is used in classifying the data as abnormal (anomalous) based on certain threshold crossing, normal otherwise. Experimental evaluation is conducted to detect abnormalities in ADL data obtained from CASAS repository as well as experimental dataset collected for this research. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is able to identify anomalous instances. The proposed approach offers more flexibility compared with the existing approaches by allowing the Normality Score threshold to be adjusted without retraining the models.",

The multitude of morbidities and disabilities that are a too common component of aging represent significant challenges to individuals, their families and to healthcare systems. Aging in place is the ability to safely and comfortably maintain an independent and high quality of life in one's own home and community and is a highly desirable goal of most individuals with the additional benefit of significantly impacting the impending enormous healthcare burden. In order to make this possible, new care models that take advantage of novel technologies for tracking important physiologic and safety parameters need to be developed and implemented. By thoughtfully doing so, it can be possible to seamlessly provide preventative interventions when and as needed, detect the earliest signs of aggravation of chronic conditions, or identify and respond to any emergency situations, such as falls or cardiac arrest. In contrast to current approaches, caring for elderly individuals in their homes based on a digital technology infrastructure could be effective and cost-saving. In this review, we provide an overview of the characteristics of potential digital solutions applicable to creative aging along with the existing evidence supporting their ability to improve care, increase quality of life, and substantially decrease the emotional and financial costs associated with aging.",

To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply the framework retrospectively in exemplary ways to a select subset of contextual studies and prospectively derive an exemplary set of empirical predictions for future developmental science. We close by outlining how central questions of contextual research can be addressed in the future and discuss the instrumental role our conceptual framework promises to play towards that end.",

By considering an action specification language, called CTAID, and Answer Set Programming, we propose and develop a system called ActRec system which takes background information into consideration and recognize activities according to our suggested definition.

Land use regulations may permit, prohibit, or impose special conditions on housing near major roadways. This paper answers two questions: First, how is residential development near major roadways regulated? Second, how common are zoning changes near major roadways, and what factors explain these changes? This paper compares the zoning designations of near-roadway parcels with others in the city, and uses two sets of logistic regression models to analyze near-roadway zoning. The results show that residential development is permitted on most near-roadway parcels, including more than 92% of those within 500 feet of a freeway. One of the main explanations is that Los Angeles’s hierarchical zoning structure allows housing development in most commercial zones. While many of these parcels have commercial development today, they could be redeveloped for residential uses in the future. Larger shares of near-roadway parcels were upzoned to allow higher residential densities compared with parcels elsewhere in the city, but this difference is explained by other locational factors.",

A wide range of devices is available to support activities of daily living, mobility, home management, and safety. The use of personal computers is significantly expanding the possibility of independent living through support systems, monitoring systems, and information resources.",

After structural equation modelling analysis, the research identified that aging satisfaction is the strongest factor in terms of influencing online public services usage, and this is developed through social interaction. Additionally, the research identified similarities and differences stemming from the cultural background of the respondents regarding their fear of using ICT. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the elderly's personal beliefs in terms of online technology usage and relevant social support, which may pave the way for determining an elderly-friendly social policy for diffusing new technology and services.",

abstract = "Purpose
This is an exploratory study carrying out qualitative research into the perceptions, attitudes and concerns of elderly persons towards wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies in terms of their application to healthcare. This work aims to provide guidance on the dimensions and items that may be included in the development of a more in-depth questionnaire to further validate the importance of the identified factors as well as the relationships between them. This study aims to contribute to opening up a communication channel between users and researchers, informing the research community in relation to applications and functionalities that users deem as either desirable, inadequate or in need of further development.
Methods
Focus groups were conducted with elderly individuals who were still living independently. To explore elderly persons’ perceptions and thoughts on current wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies and designs, discussion points were designed from concepts identified from various user acceptance theories and models. Participants were given an introduction to explain the functionality and capabilities of WSN and motes and were shown a sample mote, the Crossbow Mica2Dot. Participants were then asked to discuss their perceptions and concerns towards the likelihood of using a WSN-based healthcare system in their home.
Findings
We have identified sixteen concepts in relation to the elderly participants’ perception, concerns and attitudes towards WSN systems. Those concepts were further classified into six themes describing the determinants that may affect an elderly person's acceptance of WSNs for assisting healthcare. Some of our exploratory findings in this study indicate for example that independence is highly valued by elderly people and hence any system or technology that can prolong that independence tends to be highly regarded, that privacy of WSN health data might not be as important as typically considered, and there are also indications that cost may be the most prominent determinant influencing an elderly person's acceptance of WSNs.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that participants’ attitudes towards the idea of wireless sensor networks for health monitoring are generally positive. The exploratory findings along with the literature suggest a number of relationships which can be used in future survey design and model building.",

In the present study, the usability and acceptability of four different devices meant to be worn for the measurement of heart rate or ECG were analyzed on the basis of qualitative subjective user ratings and structured interviews of twelve older participants. The data suggest that there was a relatively high acceptance concerning these belts by older adults but none of the four harnesses was completely usable. Especially problematic to the point of limiting satisfaction among older subjects were problems encountered while adjusting the length of the belt and/or closing the locking mechanism. The two devices intended for dedicated heart rate recording yielded the highest user ratings for design, and were clearly preferred for extended wearing time. Yet for all the devices participants identified several important deficiencies in their design, as well as suggestions for improvement. We conclude that the creation of an acceptable monitoring device for older persons requires designers and developers to consider the special demands and abilities of the target group.",

abstract = "Purpose
Adult lesbian and bisexual (LB) women are more likely to be obese than adult heterosexual women. To address weight- and fitness-related health disparities among older LB women using culturally appropriate interventions, the Office on Women's Health (OWH) provided funding for the program, Healthy Weight in Lesbian and Bisexual Women (HWLB): Striving for a Healthy Community. This paper provides a description of the interventions that were implemented.
Methods
Five research organizations partnered with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community organizations to implement healthy weight interventions addressing the needs of LB women 40 years and older. The interventions incorporated evidence-based recommendations related to physical activity and nutrition. Each group intervention developed site-specific primary objectives related to the overall goal of improving the health of LB women and included weight and waist circumference reduction as secondary objectives. A 57-item core health survey was administered across the five sites. At a minimum, each program obtained pre- and post-program assessments.
Results
Each program included the OWH-required common elements of exercise, social support, and education on nutrition and physical activity, but adopted a unique approach to deliver intervention content.
Conclusion
This is the first time a multisite intervention has been conducted to promote healthy weight in older LB women. Core measurements across the HWLB programs will allow for pooled analyses, and differences in study design will permit analysis of site-specific elements. The documentation and analysis of the effectiveness of these five projects will provide guidance for model programs and future research on LB populations.",

A novel video analysis technique is presented that performs temporal segmentation of video containing human–product interaction and automatically identifies time segments in which the human has difficulties in operating the product. The method has applications in the automatic assessment of the usability of various product designs via measuring the frequency of operation difficulties. The approach is applied to a case study of water faucet design for the older adult population with dementia. Experiments in the automatic analysis of a large database of real-world recorded videos confirm the effectiveness of the approach in providing valid temporal segmentation (accuracy 88.1%) and in the correct estimation of the relative advantage (or disadvantage) of one design over another in terms of operation difficulties in performing various actions.",

The gait attributes of glaucoma patients, however, have not been studied in the literature. We design and develop a shoe-integrated sensing system for objective bio-information collection, utilize signal processing algorithms for feature estimation and leverage machine learning as well as statistical analysis approaches for gait pattern examination. The developed sensor platform is utilized in a randomized clinical trial conducted at UCLA Stein Eye Institute with 19 participants. Our trial involved both glaucoma patients and age-matched healthy participants performing a series of gait tests. With the captured sensor data, we develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to provide a quantitative comparison between gait characteristics in older adults with and without glaucoma. Our results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms achieve an accuracy of over 80% in distinguishing extracted gait features of those with glaucoma from healthy individuals. Our results also demonstrate significant difference between two groups based on extracted gait features. In particular, several features are highly discriminative with a p-value of less than1×10−10.",

To examine the associations between 2 types of continuing care retirement communities' (CCRC) residents regarding physical function and perceived quality of life.
Methods
Cross-sectional study (n=406). Eligibility criteria include age 65 years or older, residents of independent living units, and intact cognition (MMSE≥24). All-inclusive CCRCs provide unlimited access to home health services and nursing home care as needed in return for the entry and monthly fee. Fee-for-service CCRCs offer home health and nursing home services at a full fee-for-service rate. Outcomes were functional status (ADLs and IADLs) and perceived quality of life. Multivariate regressions were used to examine the associations between residents of different types of CCRCs on selected outcomes while adjusting for covariates.
Results
The all-inclusive CCRC sample was more likely to be married (53.8% versus 33.4%; P < .001), with more years of education (17.9 versus 14.4; P < .0001), and had few physician visits in the previous year in comparison to the FFS CCRC sample. Multivariate results indicate that the FFS group had worse ADL (β=0.95; P=.0003), IADL (β=0.57; P=.02) function than the all-inclusive group. There was no significant difference in perceived quality of life scores between the 2 groups.
Conclusions
Residents of both CCRCs reported equally good quality of life scores. Residents of the all-inclusive CCRC seem to have had better ADL and IADL function than the FFS CCRC residents. Prepaid home health services and nursing home care in the all-inclusive CCRC may facilitate ADL and IADL functional independence.",

The paper aims to explore effective measures and strategies for the promotion of ICT-enabled innovations for the elderly and people with special needs.
Methods
The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

Early detection and accurate prediction of ADRs is thus vital for drug development and patient safety. Multiple scientific disciplines, namely pharmacology, pharmacovigilance, and pharmacoinformatics, have been addressing the ADR problem from different perspectives. With the same goal of improving drug safety, this article summarizes and links the research efforts in the multiple disciplines into a single framework from comprehensive understanding of the interactions between drugs and biological system and the identification of genetic and phenotypic predispositions of patients susceptible to higher ADR risks and finally to the current state of implementation of medication-related decision support systems. We start by describing available computational resources for building drug-target interaction networks with biological annotations, which provides a fundamental knowledge for ADR prediction. Databases are classified by functions to help users in selection. Post-marketing surveillance is then introduced where data-driven approach can not only enhance the prediction accuracy of ADRs but also enables the discovery of genetic and phenotypic risk factors of ADRs. Understanding genetic risk factors for ADR requires well organized patient genetics information and analysis by pharmacogenomic approaches. Finally, current state of clinical decision support systems is presented and described how clinicians can be assisted with the integrated knowledgebase to minimize the risk of ADR. This review ends with a discussion of existing challenges in each of disciplines with potential solutions and future directions.",

abstract = "Background
Neighborhood built environment may profoundly influence children's physical activity (PA) and body weight. This study systematically reviewed scientific evidence regarding the impact of built environment on PA and obesity among children and adolescents in China.
Methods
A keyword and reference search was conducted in Active Living Research, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. Studies that met all of the following criteria were included in the review: (1) study designs—experimental studies, observational studies, and qualitative studies; (2) study subjects—Chinese children and/or adolescents aged ≤17 years; (3) exposures—neighborhood built environment; (4) outcomes—PA and/or body weight status; (5) article type—peer-reviewed publications; (6) time window of search—from the inception of an electronicbibliographic database to May 31, 2018; (7) country—China; and (8) language—articles written in English.
Results
A total of 20 studies, including 16 cross-sectional studies, 3 longitudinal studies, and 1 descriptive study, met the predetermined selection criteria and were included in the review. A total of 13 studies adopted subjective built environment measures reported by parents and/or children,2 adopted objective measures (e.g., geographical information system, field observations), and 5 adopted both objective and subjective measures. PA behaviors included PA, physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, active/passive commuting from/to school, and park visits. Among the 16 studies that provided some quantitative estimates of the influence of built environment on PA and body weight status, all reported a statistically significant relationship in the expected direction. Availability and accessibility in proximity to greenspaces, parks, recreational facilities, and sidewalks were found to be associated with increased PA levels, reduced sedentary behaviors, and/or active commuting among Chinese childrenand adolescents. In contrast, the absence of bike lanes and living in higher density residential areas were associated with increased likelihood of childhood overweight and obesity.
Conclusion
Neighborhood built environment plays an important role in Chinese children's PA engagement and weight outcomes. Building new exercise facilities and enhancing the accessibility of existing facilities hold the potential to enhance PA engagement among Chinese children and adolescents. In addition, urban designs that incorporate sidewalks, bike lanes, walking paths, less motorized traffic, and lower residential density are likely to promote PA and prevent childhood obesity in China.",

In the context of healthcare facilities, this complexity exists at the intersection of technology and society because the very design of these buildings forces us to consider the technology–human interface directly in terms of living-space, ethics and social priorities. In order to grasp this complexity, current healthcare design models need mechanisms to help prioritize the needs of the stakeholders. Assistance in this process can be derived by incorporating elements of technology philosophy into existing design models. In this article, we develop and examine the Inclusive and Integrated Health Facilities Design model (In2Health Design model) and its foundations. This model brings together three existing approaches: (i) the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, (ii) the Model of Integrated Building Design, and (iii) the ontology by Dooyeweerd. The model can be used to analyze the needs of the various stakeholders, in relationship to the required performances of a building as delivered by various building systems. The applicability of the In2Health Design model is illustrated by two case studies concerning (i) the evaluation of the indoor environment for older people with dementia and (ii) the design process of the redevelopment of an existing hospital for psychiatric patients.",

With an increasingly ageing population, the awareness and views of older people on energy use, technology, smart meters, smart grids are becoming progressively more important. Their behaviours regarding energy and technology use differ from the majority as they are usually living on low incomes and are at risk of fuel poverty. It is therefore important to understand their acceptance, engagement or resistance to smart metering, IHDs and external control of home appliances and heating. Their willingness and capacity to change time-use behaviours and reduce consumption is crucial. A study of older tenants in rural Scotland is presented. Sensors and IHDs were installed to measure and display electricity costs and consumption of large appliances and the electricity supply for each house, and show internal household and external temperatures. Householder’s use of energy, habits and routine, strategies for keeping warm and attitudes towards technology, smart metering, IHDs and direct external control of appliances and heating were explored through interviews. Conclusions identify significant implications for future research and policy.",

Please visit: http://www.trilcentre.org/. The views and opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and are not necessarily those of the project's funding bodies. The research is informed by a shared pool of knowledge, medical and research expertise, engineering resources, design and ethnography and is exploring new technologies that may support older people to live independently in their own homes, even if dealing with age-related illness or injury. To provide theoretical context, we position both our understanding of user perspective and our anthropological ethnographic method of enquiry. We draw on early case study material to illustrate older persons’ understanding and experiences of existing technologies from a life course perspective. We then offer an example from our ongoing ethnographic enquiry, focusing on participants’ experiences of new technology. We consider technology as social and discuss ‘having the know-how’; ‘user-led technology’ and ‘enabling/disabling new technologies’. A critical goal of the research is to achieve user perspective technological design. We argue that it's important to be clear about what is meant by ‘user perspective’ and how such user perspective is obtained; in our case, through our anthropological ethnographic lens on older persons and their ongoing relationships with existing and new technologies.
Résumé
L’article défend l’idée de la « perspective de l’utilisateur » en s’appuyant sur la partie ethnographique d’une étude interdisciplinaire irlandaise en cours : technology research for independent living (TRIL).33TRIL est décrit plus en détail ci-dessous. Le site peut être consulté : http://www.trilcentre.org/. Les points de vue et les opinions exprimés dans cet article sont ceux des auteurs et pas nécessairement ceux des organismes financeurs du projet. La recherche s’inspire d’un ensemble de connaissances partagées – expertise médicoscientifique, ressources de l’ingénierie, design et ethnographie – et explore les nouvelles technologies susceptibles d’aider les personnes âgées à vivre de manière autonome à domicile, même lorsqu’elles sont confrontées à la maladie ou à des lésions liées à l’âge. Pour situer le cadre théorique, nous présentons la manière dont nous concevons la perspective de l’utilisateur et notre méthode d’enquête anthropologique et ethnographique. Puis, nous présentons l’exploitation d’un matériel issu d’études de cas pour illustrer la compréhension et l’expérience qu’ont les personnes âgées des technologies existantes, à partir d’une approche biographique. Nous donnons ensuite un exemple, issu d’une enquête ethnographique en cours, centré sur les expériences qu’ont les usagers de nouvelles technologies. Enfin, considérant la dimension sociale des technologies, nous discutons la signification des termes « posséder le savoir-faire », « technologie centrée sur l’utilisateur » et « nouvelles technologies capacitantes/incapacitantes ». Un des objectifs critique de la recherche étant de parvenir à obtenir un design technologique dans la perspective de l’utilisateur, il apparaît important de clarifier ce concept et de montrer comment une telle « perspective de l’utilisateur » peut être obtenue à travers une approche anthropologique et ethnographique des personnes âgées et de leurs relations continues avec les technologies existantes et les nouvelles technologies.",

We examine customers above 55years of age in terms of their physical, psychological and cognitive limitations. The central objective is to assess how these differences influence the potential usage of telecare services. A mail survey was conducted in a medium-sized city to collect data. The target population was slightly over 9000 persons of which a randomized sample (N=1000) was gathered. A total of 506 usable responses were obtained for analysis. The results indicate that the adoption behavior of individuals differs amongst potential telecare users. Indeed, the behavioral patterns do not remain constant over time. Therefore, understanding the context of use has particular importance in the design phase of telecare services.",

Our prior framework, GeSmart, shows significant improvement in IGAs recognition based on smart earring which necessitates users to replace the earring batteries frequently due to its energy hungry requirement (high sampling frequency) towards fine-grained IGAs recognition. In this improved work, we propose a new segmentation technique along with GeSmart which takes the advantages of change-point detection algorithm to segment sensor data streams, feature extraction and classification thus any machine learning technique can perform significantly well in low sampling rate. We also implement a baseline traditional graphical model based gesture recognition techniques and compare their performances with our model in terms of accuracy, energy consumption and degradation of sampling rate scenarios. Experimental results based on real data traces demonstrate that our approach improves the performances significantly compared to previously proposed solutions. We also apply our segmentation technique on two benchmark datasets to prove the superiority of our technique in low sampling rate scenario.",

The taxonomy identifies different categories of classification methods for the study of fall detection based on the availability of their data during training the classifiers.

This paper introduces a systematic approach to service personalisation for mobile users in pervasive environments and presents a service-oriented distributed system architecture. The developed approach makes use of semantic technologies for user modelling and personalisation reasoning. In the paper we characterise user behaviours and needs in pervasive environments upon which ontological user models are created with special emphasis being placed on ontological modelling of dynamic and adaptive user profiles. We develop a rule-based personalisation mechanism that exploits semantic web rule mark-up language for rule design and a combination of semantic and rule-based reasoning for personalisation. We use two case studies focusing on providing personalised travel assistance for people using Help-on-Demand services deployed on a smart-phone to contextualise the discussions within the paper. The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype system, which includes Help-on-Demand services, content management services, user models and personalisation mechanisms in addition to application specific rules. Experiments have been designed and conducted to test and evaluate the approach with initial results demonstrating the functionality of the approach.",

The number of research projects that have emerged around the world during these last years is very important. Thus we are interested in studying a number of these projects. In this study, we focus on European projects because there is a great similarity with other projects (American, Asian and African projects). After a detailed study of various European research projects conducted in the telemonitoring of patients field, we identify the main requirements of a telemonitoring system. Then, we introduce the common components of these systems. After that, we provide a comparative study in terms of offered services, technical issues, supported functionalities and tools involved in the implementation of the proposed systems. Finally, we introduce some interesting perspectives for the patient telemonitoring research field.",

A battery of digitized cognitive and functional assessments was administered on a tablet, along with a technology questionnaire, to Canadian adults over 65 years who called 911 for paramedic services or who presented to an emergency department. 330 people between the ages of 65 and 97 years (mean = 75.8 years, standard deviation = 7.6) participated in the study. We observed significant relationships between elderly adults’ responses to questions about their technology use and their functional status and frailty scores with more technology use implying better functional status and less frailty.

It’s very difficult to do the continuous monitoring of elder people by a caretaker manually. This motivated us to propose an automatic paralytic attack detection scheme using surveillance video analysis. Due to the unavailability of standard video dataset, we collected the training video data from different people that contain the persons’ behavior during normal conditions and in the presence of a paralytic attack (simulated). Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to extract the features from the collected training video set and labeled it into two classes, say normal or abnormal. Basically, we analyzed the facial expression change as the criteria, and for better classification accuracy a new weighted euclidean distance based measure is introduced in this article while dealing with PCA features. An experimental study has been carried out on the collected video data, and we analyzed classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Classification accuracy obtained while using proposed weighted euclidean distance methods are compared with the other well-known classification techniques such as minimum euclidean distance based classification, support vector machine (SVM) classification, k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN). The comparative study shows that proposed weighted euclidean distance along with PCA features is able to detect faster than other methods with almost the same detection accuracy.",

The present study aims to augment the network of home care around elderly. We investigate the nature of cooperative work between relatives and home care workers around elderly persons; present the CareCoor system developed to support that work; and report experiences from two pilot tests of CareCoor.
Methods
We employed ethnographic fieldwork methods and conducted participatory design workshops to throw light on the nature of cooperative home care work, and to elicit implications for the design of an IT system that would support the work of relatives and home care workers around elderly persons. The design implications led to the development of a prototype, called CareCoor, which is accessible via a tablet PC and on the Internet. CareCoor was subsequently evaluated in two pilot tests. The first lasted a week and included three elderly, their next of kin and the affiliated home care workers, while the second test lasted for six weeks and involved five elderly people, their next of kin and relevant home care workers.
Results
In the paper we make three major points, namely, (1) home care work is highly cooperative in nature and involves substantial coordinative efforts on the part of the actors involved, (2) the network of care around elderly can be augmented with new technology that allows all members of the network to follow, influence and be a part of the cooperative care of the elderly, and (3) CareCoor, the prototype introduced in this study, shows promise as it was well received during test and evaluation.
Conclusion
Home care work is increasingly important due to the ageing populations of Europe, the USA and large parts of Asia. Home care work between relatives and home care workers is inherently a cooperative effort, and can be facilitated and augmented by new information technology such as CareCoor. The pilot tests of CareCoor revealed promising results and will be further developed and evaluated in a larger test.",

abstract = "At present, there is a growing need for assisting living systems for the elderly. This type of technology must meet certain accessibility and usability requirements to be adopted successfully. Speech-based interfaces represent a very attractive option for improving the usability and acceptability of assistive technologies for elderly users because they provide a very easily accessible interface and also facilitate paralinguistic analysis of the user's voice to provide valuable information about their emotional and mental states while interacting with a computer system. This information can be used to improve the quality of the interaction between the assistive system and its user. In this study, we propose a method based on the automatic recognition of acoustic paralinguistic phenomena for estimating the quality of speech-based interactions. The proposed method automatically recognizes paralinguistic phenomena (e.g., shouting, hyper-articulation, and hesitation) during the interaction between the user and the system. The interaction is then characterized based on the occurrence of these phenomena. A model is trained using this characterization, which can estimate the quality of the interaction. Using this method, we obtained good recognition performance (F-measure around 70%) when classifying paralinguistic phenomena and there was also a strong correlation between the estimated quality of the interaction metrics and the quality of the interaction metrics reported by the users of an assistive system. The proposed method is useful for automatically estimating the quality of interactions perceived by users and it could support the construction of speech-based systems to adapt and personalize content as well as the style of the interaction with the user.",

First, a clearly defined taxonomy is presented in order to classify the reviewed works, which are consequently presented following a bottom-up abstraction and complexity order. At the motion level, pose and gaze estimation as well as basic human movement recognition are covered. Next, the mainly used action and activity recognition approaches are presented with examples of recent research works. Increasing the degree of semantics and the time interval involved in the HBA, finally the behaviour level is reached.

Moreover, to enable daily interaction with the robot, other functions are added, such as bringing objects, offering reminders, and entertainment. The interaction with the user is based on a multimodal user interface including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, gesture recognition, and a graphical touch-based user interface. We performed controlled laboratory user studies with a total of 49 participants (aged 70 plus) in three EU countries (Austria, Greece, and Sweden). The collected user responses on perceived usability, acceptance, and affordability of the robot demonstrate a positive reception of the robot from its target user group. This article describes the principles and system components for navigation and manipulation in domestic environments, the interaction paradigm and its implementation in a multimodal user interface, the core robot tasks, as well as the results from the user studies, which are also reflected in terms of lessons we learned and we believe are useful to fellow researchers.",

When systems presented more options per turn and avoided explicit confirmation subdialogues, both older and younger users booked appointments more quickly without compromising task success. Users with lower information processing speed were less likely to remember all relevant aspects of the appointment. Working memory span did not affect appointment recall. Older users were slightly less satisfied with the dialogue systems than younger users.

In our study, we found that that these two discourses sometimes also clash under the current, concrete strategies that have been designed to help people carry out good aging. We conducted an ethnographic study on the introduction of a telecare system in older people's homes. The telecare service consisted of a personal alarm system that elderly people could use to obtain assistance at home in case of emergency. The analysis revealed that telecare arrangements shaped particular forms of good aging by demanding identity, memory, and boundary work to align the user with the system. In these practices, “active aging” and “aging in place” sometimes clashed due to the telecare requirements that proscribed a fragile, homebound user. Actual users, however, sometimes wanted to maintain their social network in places outside their homes and would rather enact images that fit the discourse of active aging. Our analysis suggested that the current different ways of framing “good aging” demand different interventions that sometimes contradict and undermine each other.",

abstract = "Background
Technological advances in the monitoring, intervention, and rehabilitation of Parkinson’s disease have increased dramatically in recent decades. Integrating such technologies into free-living environments ensures continuous monitoring of patients’ symptomatic movement for better assessment and provision of quality care.
Aim
To review studies testing the feasibility and usability of technology for continuous mobility monitoring among patients with Parkinson’s disease in free-living environments.
Methods
Using electronic databases, 31 original studies were identified. We classified the mobility monitoring devices and systems used in the feasibility tests for monitoring Parkinson’s disease during daily activities in free-living environments.
Findings
The choice of technology for Parkinson’s disease management varied in its advantages, including cost, usability, design and functionality, or quality of information. The major developments in home monitoring approaches can be classified as: (1) wearable sensors only; (2) smartphone applications; (3) web-based applications combined with wearable devices; and (4) ambient sensors combined with wearable devices. The findings from this review suggest that mobility monitoring devices are highly feasible for monitoring the daily activities of patients in a habitual free-living environment. However, there are still relatively few studies testing the feasibility and effectiveness of such devices in free-living environments.
Conclusions
Experimental studies seeking to validate monitoring systems in unstructured real-life environments remain limited. However, the major findings of this study indicate that new technologies can be useful and supportive tools for Parkinson’s disease related mobility monitoring. The use of these technologies for Parkinson’s disease management may provide qualified clinical evidence and improve clinical decision-making and quality of care.",

Existing studies emphasize elderly's travel mode, travel frequency, travel distance, travel purpose and affecting factors, however, very few aim at comparing the spatio-temporal characteristics difference between weekday and weekend. In this paper, based on GPS data and Smart Card data of buses in Qingdao, the two cohorts' basic spatio-temporal travel patterns in aspects of travel distance, travel frequency and travel start time in weekday and weekend are compared. In addition, directed weighted networks of elderly's trips and younger people's trips in weekday and weekend are constructed for analyzing spatial characteristics. Results show that although the number of elderly experiences a reduction on weekend their travel frequency and travel distance show growth on weekend. In contrast with younger people, larger geospatial expansion of elderly's travel on weekend is observed. Elderly are found to prefer traveling in areas with high elderly people's residential density. Our study provides a deeper and nuanced understanding of elderly's spatio-temporal travel characteristics difference between weekday and weekend, so as to support better traffic policy making and the promotion on age-friendly public transport service.",

A risk management framework is proposed to assist in selecting applications that match the needs and wishes of particular individuals. Risk comprises two components: the likelihood of the occurrence of harm and the consequences of that harm. In the home, the social and psychological harms are as important as the physical ones. The importance of the harm (e.g., injury) is conditioned by its consequences (e.g., distress, costly medical treatment). We identify six generic types of harm (including dependency, loneliness, fear and debt) and four generic consequences (including distress and loss of confidence in ability to live independently). The resultant client-centred framework offers a systematic basis for selecting and evaluating technology for independent living.",

Routing protocols assist in finding paths for transmission of sensed events, and they must be able to extend the lifetime of a network despite some of the limitations of sensor nodes in a network and the harsh environments in which the sensor nodes are to operate. In this paper, we survey and compare existing routing protocols in wireless sensor networks. We start by introducing the different solutions that can be used to improve the network lifetime and focus on energy efficient routing protocols as the area of the survey, in addition to network topology modeling. We also model the network regarding energy consumption, sensing and event extraction analysis in the network. Categorization of the routing protocols into homogeneous and heterogeneous was performed, for which, sub-classification into static and mobile and other behavioral patterns of the routing protocols was done. The second phase of the paper presents models and simulations of selected routing protocols and comparisons of their performances. We conclude this paper by discussing future work directions with highlights on some futuristic applications.",

abstract = "To promote energy-efficient operations in residential and office buildings, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques have been proposed to infer the fine-grained power consumption and usage patterns of appliances from power-line measurement data. Fine-grained monitoring of everyday appliances (such as toasters and coffee makers) can not only promote energy-efficient building operations, but also provide unique insights into the context and activities of individuals. Current building-level NILM techniques are unable to identify the consumption characteristics of relatively low-load appliances, whereas smart-plug based solutions incur significant deployment and maintenance costs. In this paper, we investigate an intermediate architecture, where smart circuit breakers provide measurements of aggregate power consumption at room (or section) level granularity. We then investigate techniques to identify the usage and energy consumption of individual appliances from such measurements. We first develop a novel correlation-based approach called CBPA to identify individual appliances based on both their unique transient and steady-state power signatures. While promising, CBPA fails when the set of candidate appliances is too large. To further improve the accuracy of appliance level usage estimation, we then propose a hybrid system called AARPA, which uses mobile sensing to first infer high-level activities of daily living (ADLs), and then uses knowledge of such ADLs to effectively reduce the set of candidate appliances that potentially contribute to the aggregate readings at any point. We evaluate two variants of this algorithm, and show, using real-life data traces gathered from 10 domestic users, that our fusion of mobile and power-line sensing is very promising: it identified all devices that were used in each data trace, and it identified the usage duration and energy consumption of low-load consumer appliances with ∼87% accuracy.",

Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity. Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change, where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback disease during 1998–2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society, forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and mitigation strategies in SAARC countries. We present simulation results for a future super smart grid connecting Central Asian States (CAS) to SAARC countries for bilateral electricity trade, progress in carbon capture and storage technologies in SAARC countries, and original research on utilizing CO2 (R744) for water heating in extremely cold regions.",

However, most current systems are ineffective in actual situation, difficult to use and have a low acceptance rate. There is a need for an assisted living solution to become intelligent and also practical issues such as user acceptance and usability need to be resolved in order to truly assist elderly people. Small, inexpensive and low-powered consumption sensors are now available which can be used in assisted living applications to provide sensitive and responsive services based on users current environments and situations. This paper aims to address the issue of how to develop an activity recognition method for a practical assisted living system in term of user acceptance, privacy (non-visual) and cost. The paper proposes an activity recognition and classification method for detection of Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) of an elderly person using small, low-cost, non-intrusive non-stigmatize wrist worn sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a high classification rate (>90%). Statistical tests are employed to support this high classification rate of the proposed method. Also, we prove that by combining data from temperature sensor and/or altimeter with accelerometer, classification accuracy can be improved.",

These metrics use the movement of the subject's centroid as detected by an inexpensive depth camera system. The centroid is chosen as it is less sensitive to cluttered environments typically found in a person's home. Three classes of metrics focusing on three major categories of motion were developed. The first class measures fundamental characteristics of movement in three directions. The second class focuses on measuring the walk's entropy. The third class uses periodicity in the subject's motion to deduce temporal gait parameters including stride length. Metrics are validated and compared to existing Fall Risk Assessments (FRA's). While results show strong correlation to many FRA's, not every subject has the same relationships between metrics and FRA's suggesting a unique “fingerprint” of metrics associated with a subject and/or their condition. The methodology was tested using a group of subjects undergoing Balance Wear Therapy targeting sensory inputs to improve balance control. The ability of the metrics to detect changes in the subject's ambulation when the vest is either put on, or taken off was also explored. Results show sufficient sensitivity to detect changes when the vest is donned and doffed. Many effects are not seen immediately, but over 2–4h following donning or doffing the vest. Results also demonstrate the ability, using the size of the analysis window, to focus on the time required for the effects of each metric to change.",

abstract = "Assistive systems for persons with cognitive disabilities (e.g., dementia) are difficult to build due to the wide range of different approaches people can take to accomplishing the same task, and the significant uncertainties that arise from both the unpredictability of client’s behaviours and from noise in sensor readings. Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models have been used successfully as the reasoning engine behind such assistive systems for small multi-step tasks such as hand washing. POMDP models are a powerful, yet flexible framework for modelling assistance that can deal with uncertainty and utility. Unfortunately, POMDPs usually require a very labour intensive, manual procedure for their definition and construction. Our previous work has described a knowledge driven method for automatically generating POMDP activity recognition and context sensitive prompting systems for complex tasks. We call the resulting POMDP a SNAP (SyNdetic Assistance Process). The spreadsheet-like result of the analysis does not correspond to the POMDP model directly and the translation to a formal POMDP representation is required. To date, this translation had to be performed manually by a trained POMDP expert. In this paper, we formalise and automate this translation process using a probabilistic relational model (PRM) encoded in a relational database. The database encodes the relational skeleton of the PRM, and includes the goals, action preconditions, environment states, cognitive model, client and system actions (i.e., the outcome of the SNAP analysis), as well as relevant sensor models. The database is easy to approach for someone who is not an expert in POMDPs, allowing them to fill in the necessary details of a task using a simple and intuitive procedure. The database, when filled, implicitly defines a ground instance of the relational skeleton, which we extract using an automated procedure, thus generating a POMDP model of the assistance task. A strength of the database is that it allows constraints to be specified, such that we can verify the POMDP model is, indeed, valid for the task given the analysis. We demonstrate the method by eliciting three assistance tasks from non-experts: handwashing, and toothbrushing for elderly persons with dementia, and on a factory assembly task for persons with a cognitive disability. We validate the resulting POMDP models using case-based simulations to show that they are reasonable for the domains. We also show a complete case study of a designer specifying one database, including an evaluation in a real-life experiment with a human actor.",

abstract = "Whereas creativity tasks have traditionally been supported by conventional media and tools (such as paper, pens, scissors and glue); mobile phones, tablets and other devices based on interactive surfaces are increasingly been used as additional support. Large-sized multi-touch interactive surfaces appear as an interesting alternative for supporting creativity processes and for supporting synchronous collocated collaboration. However, they have mostly been used for visualization and navigation purposes. Their use as authoring means, which would be essential in creativity tasks, has only begun to be explored. Applications and platforms that have been developed in this area rely on low-level primitives for implementing representation of ideas and discussions. We have identified a significant gap between the level of development tools and the abstractions required by end-user applications that aim to support creativity processes using interactive surfaces. This gap makes it difficult for developers to build applications that provide richer, more flexible support for innovators working collaboratively around interactive surfaces. Based upon a thorough analysis of existing applications and user practices in the field, we have identified the key actions and interaction patterns that take place during collaborative creativity sessions. Thus, we propose ISCALI (Innovation Solutions Centered on Activities for Large-sized Interfaces), a model that can be used both for describing and for prescribing the role of multi-touch surfaces in collaborative creativity tasks. In accordance to Activity Centered Design, ISCALI comprises three major components: activities, actions and operations. The central activities within the processes of creativity comprise generation, organization and evaluation of ideas. Each of these activities encompasses sets of actions. Finally, several operation sets achieve the goal of each of the actions. Based upon our model, we designed a general architecture for collaborative creativity applications. This architecture addresses the development gap through a proposed set of building blocks. These building blocks implement the main interaction patterns needed for stimulating creativity tasks that rely on interactive surfaces. We have implemented prototypical versions of these building blocks, referred to as TOKAs (Touch Operations for Creative Activities), and have made them available to developers. Independent developers have implemented applications that facilitate the use of various methodologies that foster creativity and synchronous collocated collaboration. These developers have taken advantage of the availability of TOKAs. The implementation and use of TOKAs demonstrate ISCALI's expressivity for describing and guiding the development of applications that support collaborative creativity on top of interactive surfaces.",
