abstract = "Providing support for ageing and frail populations to extend their personal autonomy is desirable for their well-being as it is for the society at large, since it can ease the economic and social challenges caused by ever-ageing developed societies. Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies and services might be a solution to address those challenges. Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

abstract = "To improve the strain on healthcare systems which happens through an aging population and a rise in chronic illness, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has attracted much attention in recent years. Cloud computing along with the IoT concept is a novel trend, for an efficient management and online processing of sensor data, and its major problem is the protection of privacy. Normally, the data is acquired from the users (i.e. patients) by the healthcare service provider and distributes them with authorized clinics or healthcare experts and these details were distributed to both pharmaceutical and life health insurance companies. Additionally the hackers have susceptible about the data of the patient, at the time of synchronization or cloud transfer is happening with the devices that are interconnected. An efficient Elman Neural Network (ENN) classifier based data protection is given in this work, which forms the cryptography and authentication. This suggested work has two varieties of process namely client side and cloud side. In client side, initially, the EEG signal is obtained from human and is processed with the help of the Hyper analytic Wavelet Transform (HWT) with Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) method. Then, through the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) scheme, signal is safeguarded from forgery. The features were drawn-out from authenticated information in cloud side, and these details were divided as abnormal or not. The appropriateness of this work is validated by executing the technique called One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with IoT that drivens the ECG-dependent health monitoring system in the cloud on both experimental analysis and simulation.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

AAL technologies are used to prevent, cure and improve the wellness and health conditions of the elderly. However, their adoption and use by older adults is still a major challenge. User Experience (UX) evaluations aim at aiding on this task, by identifying the experience that a user has while interacting with an AAL technology under particular conditions. This may help designing better products and improve user engagement and adoption of AAL solutions. However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional UX evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results.",

However, the current use of national and provincial demographic data might mask regional differences and lead to inaccurate estimations of pollution-related health impacts across cities. We applied the Global Burden of Disease methodology to develop a dataset of premature deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5 in 129 Chinese cities in 2006, 2010 and 2015, based on the information of baseline mortality rates and population densities at the city level. Our results suggested that ambient PM2.5 pollution led to 631,230 (95% confidence interval: 281,460–873,800) premature deaths in those cities in 2015, which was similar to that in 2010, but 42.8% higher than that in 2006. The reduction of premature deaths was not as obvious as the improvement in air quality in recent years, primarily owing to the aging Chinese population. For large and medium/small cities, the effects of PM2.5 abatement on alleviating public health burdens were lower than those for megalopolises and metropolises; however, such large and medium/small cities are at risk of increasing future PM2.5 pollution levels due to rapid development. Significant differences in PM2.5-induced premature deaths indicated the need for specific policies to mitigate the health burden of air pollution in different types of Chinese cities.",

abstract = "The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.",

Nationally representative data collected through the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 (NHMS, 2011) by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia were analysed. The survey used a two-stage stratified sampling method. Enumeration Blocks were selected in the first stage, while the second stage involved selection of Living Quarters. The proportions of those not using the blood cholesterol (45.4%) and blood pressure (30.8%) tests are alarmingly high. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the determinants of the use of these two health screening tests. The results show that education, ethnicity, location of residence, employment status, health insurance and smoking significantly affect the decision of the aged population to undergo these tests. Key findings are, first, time is a more dominant factor than income in determining health screening behaviour among the aged population. Second, being covered by insurance increases the propensity to undergo health screening. Third, smokers have a lower likelihood of screening than non-smokers. The findings suggest that intervention programmes should be targeted at the less-educated, employed individuals, individuals not covered by health insurance and smokers.",

The association between depressive symptom during a week and center for epidemiological studies depression (CESD) on cognitive decline was statistically significant, respectively with the following Odds ratio (OR) predicting decreased MMSE score: OR = 0.89 (p < .0001) for 5–7 days vs. less than a day and B = 0.91 (p < .0001) for depression (8–10) vs. healthy (zero). In terms of cognitive decline, depressive symptom was higher for 5–7 days (OR = 3.79, p < .0001) compared to less than a day. This study shows a statistically significant association between depressive disorder and cognitive decline in a Korean middle aged and aged population.

The growingly diverse aging population presents a challenge for the geriatric workforce, particularly its capacity to effectively respond to the sociocultural and linguistic needs of ethnic minority older adults. Informed by research on the importance of culturally-competent care in reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, this study sought to understand the meaning of healthy aging from the perspectives of Korean American, Vietnamese American, and Latino older adults.
Methods
Interviews were conducted with 30 participants recruited from community-based organizations in Southern California.
Results
Several dimensions emerged in the participants' understanding of healthy aging: (1) having good physical and mental health (2) optimism and acceptance; (3) social connectedness; (4) taking charge of one's health; and (5) independence and self-worth.
Conclusions
Results could inform the development of a culturally-responsive geriatric healthcare system that takes into account older adults' beliefs, preferences, and needs to promote successful aging.",

Methods
Data from three nation-wide community-based surveys, which were conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2015 were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed for 2015 data to identify factors associated with healthcare utilisation.
Results
Analysis noted increasing trends in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity from 1996 to 2015. Decreasing trends were noted in the prevalence of current smokers and drinkers over this 20-year period, whereas health service utilisation increased with age in all surveys. In 2015, both inpatient and outpatient care are significantly associated with increasing age and diabetes.
Conclusions
Increasing trends of health problems and healthcare utilisation were observed among older people in Malaysia. Policymakers should plan for appropriate resources to meet the challenges of an ageing population in Malaysia.",

However, economic growth has not been accompanied by sufficient attention given to important public health issues, including an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases and a decline in physical activity (PA) that comes with an aging population. The rapid growth in China's older population will soon exert an impact on the nation's economy, population health status, and health behaviors, and will increase stress on its healthcare system. This review article provides a broad perspective on the impact of rapid economic development, industrialization, and urbanization on health-related behaviors, with a specific focus on PA among older adults.

Here we describe the key role of the pre- and postnatal period of life during the first 1000 days of life, focusing on the importance of nutrition and a healthy lifestyle of mother and offspring for the prevention of neurodegeneration later in life. Environmental risk factors (i.e., nutrition, stress, xenobiotics, alcohol, drugs, smoking, etc.) mediate the genetic and epigenetic signature of offspring which may have long-term effects on the onset of neurodegeneration.",

Despite its public health importance, there is a significant lack of knowledge about PA in older Chinese adults that may hamper primary prevention efforts of health promotion in an increasingly aging population. To fill this gap, this article presents a narrative review of PA in the older Chinese adult population with a special focus on residential settings (i.e., urban and rural). Using existing studies, the review examines overall PA patterns and their correlates and discusses public health implications and future research. Although there are some preliminary indications of urban and rural differences in PA in the aging population in China, continued research efforts are needed to facilitate primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing noncommunicable diseases and promoting an active lifestyle among the largest population of older people in the world.",

We conducted the same estimations for 3 sub-samples, namely high-income, upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries to reduce the heterogeneity among them. Our empirical findings demonstrate that health care expenditure and its determinants are non-stationary, and revealed the existence of a long run relationship among variables. Furthermore, the estimation results suggest that income is not the only driver of health expenditure in the Arab world countries in the long run. Other variables such as medical progress and ageing population are also playing an important role in the increase of health care expenditure with major policy implications for the region in the long run. Furthermore, the results support that health care expenditure is a necessity good for the three income groups. Finally, the Pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test shows evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between health care expenditures and income for the full sample, as well as for the groups income.",

abstract = "Objectives
Patient portals have the potential to increase patient engagement. Older patients are of particular interest as they are likely to suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Yet, questions remain about how patient portals are perceived and deemed useful by older adults. This study explored attitudes toward, perceived utility of, and requirements of a patient portal from the perspective of older adults.
Methods
We used a mixed-method approach integrating online surveys, a review of existing portals, and participatory design workshops with 17 people who were 65 years old and over.
Results
The findings demonstrate that the participants used a patient portal primarily as one of the communication channels to interact with their providers, rather than as a tool for accessing and managing personal health information. Consequently, the perception of whether or not a provider would use the patient portal was a primary factor that older adults considered in determining the adoption and use of a portal.
Conclusions
It is important to understand that older adults would perceive a patient portal as one part of a larger communication system to interact with a provider. This finding will help researchers and practitioners to advance the design and use of a patient portal to effectively incorporate it into older adults’ health care and better serve the unique needs of the ageing population.",

But how can countries make this a reality in the face of a limited budget and an aging population? Since 2008, China has been rolling out an ambitious reform program, which aims to achieve affordable health insurance coverage for all Chinese citizens. Under this reform program, Chinese living in rural areas are eligible to enroll in a subsidized scheme called the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS). Using a three stage game model involving a government, a private fund manager and population, we explore the impact of population aging on NCMS. Our model highlights the role of government regulation and subsidy in ensuring operation efficiency of the system. We show that at optimality the government sets the operating framework for the fund manager to constrain the potential for monopoly profits. The Government subsidizes the scheme to prevent an adverse selection death spiral. However, the effectiveness of the subsidy in achieving this goal is moderated by the age structure of the population. Our model gives insights into the strengths of the NCMS framework and also can be used to support decisions about resource allocation and understand how scheme dynamics may unfold as the Chinese population ages further.",

This study is to longitudinally investigate the association between grip strength and mental health disorders in middle aged and aged population from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging.
Methods
Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) from 2006 to 2016 was assessed using longitudinal data analysis and out of the 9279 research subjects gathered 1549 (16.7%) participants were reported as Q1 group and 2074 (22.4%) participants were reported as Q5 group. To analyze the association between grip strength and mental health disorders, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used.
Results
The association between grip strength and cognitive decline was statistically significant, with the following Odds ratio (OR) predicting decreased cognitive decline: OR = 4.99 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. The association between grip strength and MMSE and CESD was also statistically significant, with the following estimate (B) predicting decreased MMSE score: B = −0.12 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. In terms of CESD, CESD score was higher for Q1 group (B = 0.34, p < .0001) compared to Q5 group.
Conclusion
This study shows a significant association between grip strength and risk of mental illness in Korean middle aged and aged population. Therefore, grip strength should be given more focus in terms of resistance training programs.",

abstract = "Background
The ageing population and growing burden of chronic disease has increased demands for primary health care services, necessitating growth of this nursing workforce. Studies have explored strategies in retaining nurses, employment conditions in primary health care, and transitioning of acute care nurses to primary health care employment. Few studies have explored how undergraduate nursing students perceive and are prepared to work in this sector.
Aim
This review synthesises evidence on the impact of undergraduate curriculum on nursing students’ attitudes, perceptions and preparedness to work in primary health care.
Design
An integrative literature review guided the synthesis of evidence.
Data sources
Scopus, ScienceDirect, CINAHL and MEDLINE were searched for relevant studies published between 2008 and 2018.
Review methods
491 studies were identified from the database searches. Following the removal of duplicates, review of abstracts and keywords against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 papers were subjected to full-text review. Twelve papers, including one thesis, met the inclusion criteria. Using an appraisal system, no paper was excluded based on methodological quality.
Results
Three themes were identified, namely: impact of curricula; knowledge and attitudes to primary health care; and students’ intention to work in primary health care. The preparation of undergraduate nursing students to work in this area is inconsistent as curricula remain acute-care focussed. Negative perceptions about the primary health care nursing role impact intentions of nursing students to work in primary health care.
Conclusion
This review highlights a need to implement strategies to improve the understanding of undergraduate nurses around the primary health care nursing role. In particular, providing students with skills, knowledge and an understanding of working in this area through curriculum content and structure may provide undergraduates with the desire and confidence to seek employment in primary health care following graduation.",

We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected biannually between 2002 and 2015. Apart from the basic measure of multimorbidity (two or more diseases within a person) we constructed two distinct measures of health in order to take into account the biology of ageing (complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations). We found that the likelihood of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations was consistently associated with the levels of household wealth, sense of control over one's life, physical activity and loneliness. Larger health inequalities were observed when health was measured as complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations than basic multimorbidity. Compared to the population group with the highest wealth, those with the lowest wealth had 47% higher odds of basic multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.34-1.61), 73% higher odds of complex multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.52-1.96) and 90% higher odds of having 10 or more functional limitations (95% C.I. 1.59-2.26). We did not find a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption, smoking and multimorbidity but rather evidence of people in ill health actively moderating their health behaviour. We suggest that materialist models of multimorbidity and functional limitation at older age can not, on their own, explain the health inequalities as the behavioural and psycho-social factors play an important role. Policies aiming to reduce the risk of multimorbidity and functional limitation should address the issue at these three levels simultaneously, using the existing national infrastructure of General Practices.",

Co-occurring chronic diseases are associated with functional limitations, particularly for the aging population ≥50 years old. Aging offenders (individual who are imprisoned) tend to have greater prevalence of chronic, mental health, and substance use disorders compared to non-imprisoned populations. Our primary aim was to determine patterns of co-occurring conditions associated with functional limitations among aging offenders.
Materials and methods
We included all male offenders from one correctional system who were ≥50 years old (n = 2270) and extracted diagnoses for chronic diseases, mental health, substance use disorders, and functional limitations from an electronic health record. We performed a principal factor analysis (PFA) to identify patterns and chi-square to determine if the multimorbid population (≥3 diagnoses) differed from peer groups in regard to functional limitations.
Results
Three patterns (chronic diseases, geriatric conditions, and mental health/substance use) emerged from PFA. Functional limitations were associated with the chronic disease pattern (p = .03) where the multimorbid group compared to non-multimorbid peers had 1.5 odds, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1], for having a physical impairment. The geriatric (p = .10) and mental health/substance use disorders (p = .07) patterns were not associated with having a functional limitation compared to the population without multiple diagnoses. Controlling for multimorbidity, functional limitations, and overlapping patterns, increasing age was the only significant factor (p = .02) associated with having a physical impairment.
Conclusion
The chronic disease pattern was consistent with investigations that included non-imprisoned populations. However, the geriatric pattern was not significant, which was unexpected.",

ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

abstract = "Like many other critical infrastructures, the public health systems of most countries have grown to high complexity and broad interdependence. Complex adaptive systems of this kind have been shown to evolve into a precarious state between order and disorder in which remote triggers can lead to cascading failure. The healthcare stresses of ageing populations, emerging infectious diseases and treatment-resistant pathogens continue to grow. However, the economic drive for leaner systems and supply chains, and their increasing interdependencies (power, water, food, fuel etc.), all contribute to the growing fragility of public health. When systems are stressed (during emergencies or disasters), accountability for effective resource use requires that health decision making switch from optimal care of individuals to a resource-conserving mode designed to maximise outcomes for the population. Understanding when and how to operate under such conditions, demands that decision makers have a strong grasp of system capacities, limitations and the beneficial or deleterious effects of parameters they are able to manipulate. These difficulties lie behind a growing effort to model health systems to inform planning and (more aspirationally) support real-time decision making. However, modelling efforts to date have been less than optimally founded and structured. Our purpose in this paper is to reframe conceptual approaches to the strategic modelling of health systems and their dependencies in order to point the way to a more productive path for health sector decision-support modelling.",

abstract = "Objective
In aging populations, a growing number of individuals are affected by cancer. However, the relevance of the disease for mental health is still controversial, especially after treatment. We drew from a representative community sample to explore the link of cancer with mental health assessing different dimensions and different periods of time.
Methods
A cohort of 14,375 men and women (35–74 years) underwent medical assessments and was queried about cancer history, previous diagnoses of mental disorders, current mental distress symptoms, and current subjective health appraisal.
Results
1066 participants (7.4%) reported a diagnosis of cancer (survival time M = 9.79 (SD = 9.07) years). Most common were breast (24.3%), skin (20.9%), gynecological (13.8%), and prostate cancer (12.9%). Based on cut-off-scores of standardized self-report scales (PHQ-9, GAD-2), rates of depression (8.4%; 95%CI 6.90–10.30) and anxiety symptoms (7.8%; 95%CI 6.30–9.60) corresponded to those of participants without cancer. In men, cancer was related to a lifetime diagnosis of depression (OR = 2.15; 95%CI 1.25–3.64). At the time of assessment, cancer was associated with reduced subjective health in both sexes and with anxiety symptoms in men (OR = 2.43; 95%CI 1.13–4.98).
Conclusion
Findings indicate different relations of cancer in men and in women with different operationalizations of mental health. They underscore that a history of cancer is not universally linked to distress in the general population. The study points out that different ascertainments of the association of cancer and mental health might be traced back to different assessment strategies. It also notes potential targets for interventions to alleviate distress, e.g. by physical activity.",

abstract = "Objectives
To track the trends in general health indicators and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), high blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol in the middle-aged urban population in the Czech Republic in 1998–2010.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
The following data from the three-phase HELEN (HEalth – Lifestyle – ENvironment) study, a prevalence questionnaire survey, were analysed: data collected from 8214 subjects in phase I, 6107 subjects in phase II, and 4389 subjects in phase III. The study subjects were aged 45–54 years and the study period spanned from 1998 to 2010. The differences in the indicators between phases were evaluated by binary and ordinal logistic regression models at a significance level of 0.01.
Results
Over the study period, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of respondents who self-rated their health as very good or good: from 46.6% to 51.0% in males (P = 0.006) and from 45.5% to 49.9% in females (P < 0.001). At the same time, the rates of respondents under long-term medical follow-up rose significantly from 36.3% to 44.3% (P < 0.001) and from 46.4% to 56.2% (P < 0.001), respectively. CVD prevalence did not change although the percentage of males and females with high blood pressure (from 29.3% to 36.6% and from 26.0% to 31.2%, respectively) and elevated total cholesterol (from 29.0% to 36.6% and from 27.3% to 32.4%, respectively) increased significantly.
Conclusions
Self-rated health among the middle-aged population in the Czech Republic improved during the 1998–2010 period, but, at the same time, more people needed to be followed up for a disease. The proportions of respondents with hypertension and elevated blood cholesterol increased while the CVD rates did not vary significantly.",

Energy efficiency improvements of homes may benefit health and access to affordable energy, yet better knowledge about contextual mechanisms and household practices is needed for the development of effective programs. This paper presents a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled retrofit trial targeting low-income older householders. Socio-technical systems thinking offered a useful approach to explore the construct of the engineering-dominated concept of residential energy efficiency in combination with the people-focused experience of housing and health. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain health, energy cost, temperature and psycho-social outcomes for winter. The findings showed that small retrofits may mitigate the growing energy demands of this ageing population group, provide better comfort and reduce energy costs, but that the effectiveness of the retrofits was reduced by socially shared heating and ventilation practices that contradicted engineering assumptions, the physiological capabilities of the householder and the modes of energy bill payments. A program that is framed around caring and safety and combines retrofits, tariff optimisations and householder practices could provide equitable climate change mitigation outcomes and co-benefits for health for this population group. The paper concludes with implications for the integration of equity and health as goals into low carbon transitions.",

Challenges to RHS implementation included difficulties aligning the goals, values, and priorities of multiple actors, the need for better integration across clusters, differing care capabilities and capacities across partners, healthcare financing structures that may not reflect RHS goals, scalability and evaluation of pilot programmes, and disease-centricity, provider-centricity, and medicalisation in health and healthcare. Suggested ways forward included building relationships between actors to facilitate integration; exploring innovative new models of care; clear long-term/scale-up plans for successful pilots; healthcare financing reforms to meet changing patient and population needs; and developing evaluation systems reflective of RHS principles and priorities.",

The rapid increase in the aged population has resulted in a growing number of cases of chronic diseases. This increase is an important demographic change that low- and middle-income countries have to face and poses a new challenge to health services.

This study describes the prevalence of anemia, hypertension and diabetes and the overall health status in pre-elderly and elderly subjects enrolled in two primary health care clinics, Eldorado and Piraporinha, in the city of Diadema, São Paulo.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 373 participants. Clinical data were collected from patient charts and the degree of disability and common mental disorders, as well as demographic data were obtained by interviews.
Results
The prevalence of anemia was approximately 11% and hypertension was 70% and 81% in Eldorado and Piraporinha, respectively. The frequency of diabetes was 52% in Eldorado and 30% in Piraporinha. The subjects of both health care clinics reported having difficulties in some of their daily physical and instrumental activities, with physical symptoms and emotional disorders.

The purpose of this research work is to explore the patients’ perceptions and experiences of self-management of diabetes in the rural area of Pakistan and to better understand differences in diabetes self-management among men and women living with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as the barriers and challenges of self-management of diabetes.
Methods
30 participants were recruited from a medical centre at Al-Rehman hospital at Abbottabad, Pakistan. Qualitative method was used to conduct interviews of n=30 patients with Type 2 diabetes using a semi-structured interview approach with audio recording to explore their perceptions and experiences of the self-management of type 2 diabetes and the factors that influence the management of diabetes.
Results
The qualitative analyses revealed six themes: stigma attached to the disease; self-management in context; patient-doctor relationship; adherence to diet and exercise; access to diabetes resources; and social support. Women were more adaptable to diabetic conditions, disclosed their diabetes more readily and are a lot more ready to integrate management into their daily lives, whereas men were more reluctant to tell friends and family about their diabetes due to the stigma attached to the disease and were less observant of self-management practices in social settings. Women used socially interactive resources such as internet access and education classes whereas men relied more on self-directed learning and wanted the guidance of health professionals. Finally, both men and women reported lack of support from the health care practitioners and families in managing their diabetes.
Conclusions
The results of this qualitative research highlighted the challenges of diabetes self-management among men and women in the rural area of Pakistan and barriers to self-management. These findings may help to inform gender-sensitive diabetes self-management approach, diabetes awareness in the population, counselling and support.",

The French healthcare insurance databases have proven to be valuable tools for the conduct of pharmaco-epidemiological studies with regards to the size of the population covered and that of the available information. Their wider use in the field of pediatric pharmacoepidemiology is of paramount importance given the existing gap of knowledge in the use and effects of many drugs in children and adolescents as well as the difficulties to conduct clinical research studies in this age population. However, because of the architectural complexity of these databases and their specificities, specific expertise should be developed in order to ensure the reliability of studies based on these data. To this purpose, it is important to facilitate knowledge sharing through national collaborative projects.",

This Series paper describes the current state of cancer control in Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs). PICTs are diverse but face common challenges of having small, geographically dispersed, isolated populations, with restricted resources, fragile ecological and economic systems, and overburdened health services. PICTs face a triple burden of infection-related cancers, rapid transition to lifestyle-related diseases, and ageing populations; additionally, PICTs are increasingly having to respond to natural disasters associated with climate change. In the Pacific region, cancer surveillance systems are generally weaker than those in high-income countries, and patients often present at advanced cancer stage. Many PICTs are unable to provide comprehensive cancer services, with some patients receiving cancer care in other countries where resources allow. Many PICTs do not have, or have poorly developed, cancer screening, pathology, oncology, surgical, and palliative care services, although some examples of innovative cancer planning, prevention, and treatment approaches have been developed in the region. To improve cancer outcomes, we recommend prioritising regional collaborative approaches, enhancing cervical cancer prevention, improving cancer surveillance and palliative care services, and developing targeted treatment capacity in the region.",

The ageing population will create in the medium term a new dynamic of recruitment in various sectors, including health. With increased life expectancy, the care of chronically ill has become an important area in the context of health services, since they need to be increasingly more focused on the need to provide palliative rather than curative care. Rationalization of resources must be a goal so that waste is minimized. The present model of palliative care ceases to respond to the pressing needs. What to do, to adapt to the changes brought by demographic change and by innovation? What models should be adopted for better resource optimization in palliative care? A literature review was carried out, including articles that compared the main differences between hospital and home care. Portugal has a multi-sectoral palliative care model, in light of what happens in reference countries, however, a better rationalization of resources will be required in order to ensure optimization in the distribution of patients. We also conclude that there is a gap between the patient's will and what is recommended. To respect the individual preferences of the patient, it is necessary to develop quality home-based palliative care services, focusing on training and the expansion of field teams.",

abstract = "Background
The human population is aging. A systematic summary of the epidemiology of skin diseases in the aged is lacking.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted including electronic database searches in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The eligibility criteria were primary incidence and prevalence studies or secondary data analysis, English or German language, subjects being 65+ years and reported skin problems or diseases. Data extraction was conducted using a standardized data collection form and the methodological quality of included studies was assessed.
Results
After screening of 1491 records, 74 records were included reporting data for more than 20 skin conditions. The majority of prevalence and incidence figures was identified for hospital and long-term care settings. The most prevalent skin diseases were fungal infections (14.3%–64%), dermatitis (1%–58.7%), xerosis (5.4%–85.5%) and benign skin tumors (1.7%–74.5%). Additionally, pressure ulcer prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 46% and incidence from 0.8% to 34%.
Conclusion
Skin conditions and diseases in aged populations are frequent. Health care practitioners should pay attention to those, although skin conditions might not be the primary reason for seeking care. Epidemiological data are lacking especially for home care and community settings although this can be regarded as the most important from a public health and prevention point of view. The methodological quality and reporting of epidemiological studies in the aged populations must be improved.

abstract = "Background and objectives
Detailed information about the current and future geographic distribution of Australia's frail population provides critical evidence to inform policy, resource allocation and planning initiatives that aim to treat and reverse frailty. Frailty is associated with poor health outcomes, including disability and death. It is also characterised by increased health care usage and costs. Understanding the distribution and growth of frailty is important for planning and budgeting service provision and health interventions aimed to support the needs of Australia's growing ageing population. The objective of this research is to provide baseline mapping and area level population estimates of Australia's current and future frail and pre-frail populations.
Research design and methods
Geospatial modelling was applied to national frailty prevalence rates to provide estimates of the size, distribution and potential growth of Australia's frail and pre-frail population.
Results
It is estimated that in 2016 approximately 415,769 people living in Australia aged 65 years or more are frail and almost 1.7 million people are pre-frail. In future years, as the population ages, these figures will increase rapidly, reaching 609,306 frail and 2,248,977 pre-frail by 2027, if prevalence continues at current levels. The geographic distribution of this projected growth is not uniform and while the largest frail populations will continue to be located in the major cities, the fastest growth will be in the outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas.
Discussion and implications
The projected growth of frail populations in outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas may be reduced by targeting health interventions in these areas and improving access to support services. Frailty is a dynamic condition that is amenable to intervention. Reducing frailty will lead to benefits in wellbeing for older Australians in addition to reductions in health care costs.",

However, the characteristics of green structures have been overlooked in previous studies, and the mediation effects of green structures on the suicide rate have not been analyzed. To evaluate the mediation impacts of green structures (patch area, fragmentation, and patch distance), this study explored the potential pathways and effects of green structures on the suicide rate using partial least squares modeling with data from Taiwan. Other factors influencing the suicide rate, such as economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were also considered in the model. The results revealed a negative association between the suicide rate and patch area (standardized total effect coefficient (STEC) = −0.42), but there were positive associations with fragmentation (STEC = 0.14), and patch distance (STEC = 0.35) of green structures. Therefore, maximizing the patch area, and minimizing fragmentation and patch distance can contribute to a reduction in the suicide rate. Fragmentation minimization was found to be crucial for both genders, while patch-area maximization and patch-distance minimization were only influential for females. Moreover, economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were influential for both genders. This is the first study to consider the direct and indirect pathways and effects of the green structure on suicide rate. Instead of considering only the area covered by green spaces, it was found that other characteristics of green structures should also be considered when formulating greening policies.",

Of ∼10.2 million people with chronic HCV infection in Europe, 6.7 million live in Eastern Europe, 2.3 million in Western Europe and 1.2 million in Central Europe. HCV transmission continues to occur in parallel with an increasing HCV-related liver disease burden, the result of an ageing population infected during peak HCV epidemics decades earlier. In 2016, the World Health Organization set targets to eliminate HCV infection as a major public health threat by 2030. Across Europe, an estimated 36% of those living with chronic HCV infection have been diagnosed and ∼5% have been treated. A major barrier to enhancing HCV treatment uptake has been restrictions set by payers, including national governments and others, in response to the initially high list prices of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. The aims of this article are to discuss DAA restrictions in Europe, why DAA restrictions are still in place, what has facilitated the removal of DAA restrictions, and what challenges remain as we attempt to eliminate HCV as a major public health threat in the region by 2030.",

At the global level, cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality rates are increasing. These trends are not fully explained by a growing and ageing population: with marked regional and socioeconomic disparities, lifestyle factors, the resources dedicated to preventive medicine, and the occupational and environmental control of hazardous chemicals all playing a role. While it is difficult to establish the contribution of chemical exposure to the societal burden of cancer, a number of measures can be taken to better assess the carcinogenic properties of chemicals and manage their risks. This paper discusses how these measures can be informed not only by the traditional data streams of regulatory toxicology, but also by using new toxicological assessment methods, along with indicators of public health status based on biomonitoring. These diverse evidence streams have the potential to form the basis of an integrated and more effective approach to cancer prevention.",

abstract = "Background
Empirical evidence suggests that multimorbidity and disability are each significantly associated with out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures; however few efforts have been made to explore their joint association with OOP health expenditures.
Objectives
To estimate the association of multimorbidity and disability with OOP health expenditures in households with older adults in Mexico, as well as the potential interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability on OOP health expenditures.
Methods
Longitudinal study based on data collected as part of the Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2009) and Wave 2 (2014), a nationally representative study in Mexico with a sample of older adults aged 50 and older. The dependent variable was OOP health expenditures, and main exposure variables were multimorbidity and disability. Two-Part regression models were used to analyze the relation between multimorbidity, disability and OOP health expenditures.
Results
Multimorbidity was associated with the probability of incurring OOP health expenditures (OR = 1.28, CI95% 1.11–1.48), and also the tertiles of disability (2nd tertile: OR = 1.45, CI95% 1.23–1.70; 3rd tertile: OR = 2.19, CI95% 1.81–2.66). The presence of multimorbidity was associated with an increase of 13% in average OOP health costs (β = 0.13, CI95% 0.01–0.25), and 16% for the 3rd tertile of disability (β = 0.16, CI95% 0.01–0.31). We did not find significant interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability.
Conclusions
Multimorbidity and disability appear to be important determinants of OOP health expenditures. The economic implications for the households and the health system should be highlighted, particularly in low- and middle-income countries because of the rapid growth of their aging populations.",

abstract = "Before 1990, Germany was divided for more than 40 years. While divided, significant mortality disparities between the populations of East and West Germany emerged. In the years following reunification, East German mortality improved considerably, eventually converging with West German levels. In this study, we explore changes in the gender differences in health at ages 20–59 across the eastern and western regions of Germany using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the 1990–2013 period. We apply random-effects linear regressions to the SOEP data to identify trends in health, measured as self-assessed health satisfaction, after German reunification. The findings indicate that women were substantially less satisfied with their health than men in both West and East Germany, but that the gender gap was larger in East Germany than in West Germany. Furthermore, the results show that respondents’ satisfaction with their health decreased over time, and that the decline was steeper among men – and particularly among East German men – than among women. Thus, the initial male advantage in health in East and West Germany in the years immediately after reunification diminished over time, and even reversed to become a female advantage in East Germany. One interpretation of this finding is that stress-inducing post-reunification changes in the political and social landscape of East Germany had lasting damaging consequences for men’s health. Ongoing risky health behaviors and high levels of economic insecurity due to unemployment could have had long-lasting effects on the health of the working-aged population. A partial explanation for our finding that health declined more sharply among East German men than among their female counterparts could be that women have better compensatory mechanisms than men for dealing with psychosocial stress.",

The data were retrieved from skeletal remains uncovered at 21 sites throughout the Middle Elbe-Saale region (MES), comprising a total of 494 individuals with preserved teeth. The data generated were examined for age- and sex-related differences in order to gain information about the dietary habits and socio-economic structures of the period with the goal of identifying potential diachronic changes. The results indicated that dietary habits changed over the course of the Neolithic period: the prevalence of caries significantly decreased between the Early and Late Neolithic. The adults from the Early Neolithic sample, particularly those from the LBK bore the highest rate of caries. This highlights the essential importance of cereals in the diet of the early farmers in the Middle Elbe-Saale region. As time went on, meat and dairy products became more and more important, which had a positive impact on dental health. The data also show sex-specific differences: women were more often affected by caries than men and female jaws also generally exhibited greater numbers of carious teeth than their male counterparts. Dental health is a reflection of both biological factors and of economic and sociocultural structures.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the hospitalization rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in a southern-european country and its associated charges over a period of 16 years.
Methods
We identified all discharges with a primary diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) between 2000 and 2015 in data provided by the Central Administration of Health Services (ACSS). National estimates of hospitalization rates were assessed and adjusted to gender, age, population, and hospitalizations. Hospitalization charges were also assessed.
Results
There were an estimated 31 358 and 16 669 discharges for CD and UC, respectively. From 2000 to 2015, hospitalization rates per 100000 habitants increased for CD (8.4–11.2) and remained stable for UC (4.4–4.9). The hospitalization rate for IBD increased slightly over time (12.8 per 100 000 habitants in 2000 and 16.1 in 2015). Annual total hospitalization charges amounted to 4.0M€ in 2000 and 5.7M€ in 2015. This increase was mainly due to a rise in the total expenses of CD-related hospitalizations.
Conclusion
CD hospitalization rates per 100000 inhabitants increased over time while remaining constant for UC. Hospitalization charges for IBD increased approximately 2.0M€ during the study period, representing an important burden in the national healthcare system.",

The relative percentage of older people is growing, while fewer young employees are entering the labour force. This phenomenon is directly connected with ageing of the workforce. Older workers constitute a special group with characteristics that require special attention from the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) point of view. The aim of this paper is to address what changes occur in ageing workers as a result of physical and psychological processes and the possible impacts of these at work in relation to OHS and the concept of sustainable work and workplaces. In addition, this paper discusses factors affecting work ability and worker’s performance in relation to the ageing phenomenon. Finally, based on the literature, the paper proposes measures to minimize age-related risks and increase awareness. These measures should be designed and adopted at the early stages of working life and continue until retirement. By reducing risk factors of employees, the rate of occupational accidents and occupational diseases may be decreased, thus saving costs for employers, health system and insurance costs, while simultaneously facilitating a healthier retirement for the working-age population.",

In the context of a rapidly ageing population, Singapore is anticipating a rise in multimorbidity, disability, and dependency, which are driven by physical frailty. Healthy Older People Everyday (HOPE) is an epidemiologic population-based study on community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older in Singapore.
Objective
To investigate the prevalence of frail and prefrail states and their association with polypharmacy, multimorbidity, cognitive and functional status, and perceived health status among community-dwelling older adults in Singapore.
Methods
Participants for HOPE were older adults aged 65 years and older recruited from a cohort study on the northwest region of Singapore. Analysis was performed on data collected from a combination of interviewer-administered questionnaires (including FRAIL scale, EQ-5D, Mini Mental State Examination, Barthel index, and Lawton IADL scale), clinical assessments, and physical measurements (including hand grip strength and Timed-Up-and-Go [TUG] test).
Results
A total of 1051 older adults (mean age 71.2 years) completed the study. More than half (57.2%) were female. The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty was 6.2% and 37%, respectively. Frailty was associated with older age, female gender, Indian (instead of Chinese) ethnicity, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment, weaker hand grip strength, longer TUG times, and poor perceived health status. Those with underlying cognitive impairment and frailty were at greater risk of adverse health outcome.
Conclusion
Frailty is a complex health state with multiple domains and dimensions. In our study in a multiethnic Asian population, we identified nonmodifiable factors and modifiable risk factors (multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment) that were associated with frailty. Interventions will have to be multipronged and will require a collaborated effort in order to effect change and improve the health span in rapidly ageing populations.",

The paper aims to explore effective measures and strategies for the promotion of ICT-enabled innovations for the elderly and people with special needs.
Methods
The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

We investigate whether higher regional employment levels are associated with better health over and above individual level employment. Individual level data (N = 23,078 aged 15–64 years) were taken from 16 countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) participating in the 2014 European Social Survey. Regional employment rates were extracted from Eurostat, corresponding with the start (2008) and end (2013) of the Great Recession. Health outcomes included self-reported heart or circulation problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, self-rated health, depression, obesity and allergies (as a falsification test). We calculated multilevel Poisson regression models, which included individuals nested within regions, controlling for potential confounding variables and country fixed effects. After adjustment for individual level socio-demographic factors, higher average regional employment rates (from 2008 to 2013) were associated with better health outcomes. Individual level worklessness was associated with worsened health outcomes, most strongly with poor self-rated health. In models including both individual worklessness and the average regional employment rate, regional employment remained associated with heart and circulation problems, depression and obesity. There was evidence of an interaction between individual worklessness and regional employment for poor self-rated health and depression. The findings suggest that across 16 European countries, for some key outcomes, higher levels of employment in the regional labour market may be beneficial for the health of the local population.",

abstract = "Background & Aims
Population growth and changes in demographic structure are linked to trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. The aim of this study is to estimate future CRC incidence in the ageing population, and compare trends across developing and developed regions.
Methods
Cancer and population data were extracted from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Annual incidence rates for the major types of cancer in 118 selected populations were extracted from 102 cancer registries in 39 countries worldwide. We selected 8 jurisdictions (from the United States, Europe, and Asia) that reported 20-year cancer incidence rates since 1988. Time series models were constructed to project cancer incidence, by sex and age, to 2030. Incidence rates for persons older than 65 years were combined and further adjusted for change of ageing population. We compared age-adjusted incidence rates among the jurisdictions.
Results
The total population older than 65 years old was 12,917,794 in 1988, and the number increased by almost 40% to 17,950,115 in 2007. In developed countries in the West CRC incidence is predicted to decrease by 16.3% in the United States, increase by 4.8% in the United Kingdom, and increase by 4.7% in Sweden by 2030. In developing countries, such as China (Shanghai), Croatia, and Costa Rica, CRC incidence is predicted to increase in a steep curve by 2030 because of the growing population and ageing effect; in 2030, the incidence increases were 60.5% for China, 47.0% for Croatia, and 18.5% for Costa Rica. We also predict CRC incidence will increase greatly by 2030 in Japan and Hong Kong, which are developed regions.
Conclusions
With the exception of the United States, the incidence of CRC is expected to continue to rise in most regions in the coming decades, due to population growth and changes in demographic structure. The predicted increases are more marked in developing regions with limited health care resources.",

abstract = "Background
Aging populations have led to increasing numbers of seniors presenting for emergency surgery. Older patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization, and increased institutionalization. We hypothesized that increased frailty would be a risk factor for increased health care costs in elderly surgical patients who have undergone emergency abdominal surgery.
Methods
A prospective cost analysis of emergency general surgery patients 65 years of age and older was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Preadmission Clinical Frailty Scale score and Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications were collected. Patients were followed for 6 months after discharge. Hospitalization costs were calculated using the Alberta Health Services (AHS) microcosting database; other costs were obtained from Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health databases. The primary outcome was total insured cost (2016 Can$). Multivariate generalized linear regression of log-transformed costs was conducted.
Results
Overall, 321 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 7.8), median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3, mean length of stay was 15.9 days (standard deviation 23.4), and 48% suffered a complication. Median total insured cost was Can$18,021 and median total cost was Can$26,739. Multivariate analysis found American Society of Anesthesiologists score (adjusted ratio [AR] = 1.24, P = .001), CFS (AR = 1.27, P < .001), major complications (AR = 2.11, P < .001), and minor complications (AR = 1.48, P < .001) lead to increased total insured costs.
Conclusion
Costs increased—after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and preadmission function as frailty—and American Society of Anesthesiologists score increased if minor or major complications occurred. The detection of frailty represents an opportunity to target risk-reduction strategies and interventions to improve outcomes and decrease cost.",

abstract = "Background
Few studies consider multiple pathways for explaining the gendered patterns of depression in Europe’s aged population, although ageing is often associated with an increased exposure to risk factors for depression, and the relevance of these risk factors is likely to differ between countries.
Methods
Based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we assess the relevance of gender inequalities in the exposure to psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors for explaining the gender gap in depression. Further, we investigate the association between depressive symptoms and these explanatory variables by gender and analyse whether their relevance differs between countries.
Results
Both the prevalence of depression by gender and the magnitude of the gender gap were low in Northern Europe and rather high in Southern Europe. Part of the gender gap was explained by psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors but significant gender differences remained. Health-related factors were of outstanding importance for explaining within-country variation in depressive symptoms for both women and men. With regard to psychosocial and socio-economic factors, the results were less clear.
Conclusion
The assessment of gender inequalities in depression and their determinants within different social policy contexts enables evidence-based interventions to reduce the gender gap and ensure high quality of life for older men and women. To that end, the reduction of health-related risk factors seems to be of utmost importance in all European countries, whereas interventions in the area of socio-economic and psychosocial risk factors should be gender- and context-specific.",

It results from an imbalance in the natural process of bone remodeling, a continuous cycle for bone formation and bone resorption. Though various drugs acting on different therapeutic targets of osteoporosis are available, focus is now shifting towards the natural alternatives to avoid side effects associated with the drug therapy. This review encompasses the spectrum of nutraceuticals such as minerals, herbs, phytochemicals and dairy products which can be included in the regime for osteoporotic patients to support bone health. Although scientific studies provide evidences of therapeutic efficacy of nutraceuticals, in-depth clinical investigation is need of the hour for its safe consumption by osteoporotic population. Furthermore, global regulatory requirements can be recommended for rational and safe use of nutraceuticals considering the tremendous growth of nutraceutical market in the near future.",

Although Israel is still young in years, with relatively high birth rates and older people (individuals aged 65 years or older) constituting only about 11% of its population, the absolute number of older people is growing rapidly. Life expectancy is high, and increasing numbers of people are living to advanced old age (older than 85 years). A wide spectrum of geriatric care is provided within a universal system providing health services to all citizens. Community and institutional care is available, and many innovative programmes are being developed. The unique demographic characteristics of the ageing society in Israel reflect cultural and multiethnic diversity, in addition to a high rate of immigration of older people. To meet the growing challenges, address disparities, and search for innovation will require planning and development of adequate services at the highest level.",

Given the aging population, it is predicted that admissions with heart failure will increase. Whilst pharmacological therapy has improved the associated morbidity and mortality, there is a need for additional therapies to improve the clinical outcome as the death rate remains high. Curcumin is a natural product derived from turmeric that appears to have cardiovascular benefit through a number of mechanisms. In this review, we have assessed the mechanisms by which curcumin may exert its effects in different models of heart failure and show that it has promise as a complementary treatment in heart failure.",

Moreover, the findings also revealed that age, income, income sufficiency, year of schooling and health condition had the positive influences on the opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement. Males had the higher opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement than females while married people had the higher opportunity than people with the other marital statuses. Private enterprise employees were found having the lower opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement than all other occupations and those who admitted that the economic preparation for retirement was necessary had the higher opportunity to have above average preparation than those who did not. In addition, those who lived as a head of household or a spouse of a head of household had the highest opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement. However, living with children under 18 years old lowered the opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement while indebtedness raised the opportunity to have it.",

These behaviors may put patients at risk for harm to self or others and lead to inefficient, ineffective, or inappropriate use of resources. This session aims to engage participants in considering varying definitions of patients with complex needs, and how VHA has worked to understand these needs, identify promising practices, and prepare a workforce capable of meeting these needs. In the first presentation, the presenter will discuss varying conceptualizations of “complex patients” and related challenges for targeted program development and dissemination. An overview of the development, activities, and plans for the VHA Care for Patients with Complex Problems Program will be presented. The audience will be engaged in discussing the challenges for providing geriatric behavioral care across inpatient mental health, nursing home, and rehabilitation care settings, and VHA efforts to develop guidance for teams wishing to enhance capacity to provide geriatric behavioral care in these settings will be shared. A unique program, the Behavioral Recovery Outreach (BRO) Team, that facilitates transitions of care for Veterans with complex behavioral needs from inpatient nursing care to community-based care settings will be described. A closing discussion with the audience will center around the next steps in policy and program development and evaluation needed to meet the needs of aging population with complex care needs.",

Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

Cloud computing along with the IoT concept is a novel trend, for an efficient management and online processing of sensor data, and its major problem is the protection of privacy. Normally, the data is acquired from the users (i.e. patients) by the healthcare service provider and distributes them with authorized clinics or healthcare experts and these details were distributed to both pharmaceutical and life health insurance companies. Additionally the hackers have susceptible about the data of the patient, at the time of synchronization or cloud transfer is happening with the devices that are interconnected. An efficient Elman Neural Network (ENN) classifier based data protection is given in this work, which forms the cryptography and authentication. This suggested work has two varieties of process namely client side and cloud side. In client side, initially, the EEG signal is obtained from human and is processed with the help of the Hyper analytic Wavelet Transform (HWT) with Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) method. Then, through the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) scheme, signal is safeguarded from forgery. The features were drawn-out from authenticated information in cloud side, and these details were divided as abnormal or not. The appropriateness of this work is validated by executing the technique called One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with IoT that drivens the ECG-dependent health monitoring system in the cloud on both experimental analysis and simulation.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

AAL technologies are used to prevent, cure and improve the wellness and health conditions of the elderly. However, their adoption and use by older adults is still a major challenge. User Experience (UX) evaluations aim at aiding on this task, by identifying the experience that a user has while interacting with an AAL technology under particular conditions. This may help designing better products and improve user engagement and adoption of AAL solutions. However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional UX evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results.",

While clinical solutions arrive, actions for improving the quality of the daily living of these patients are needed. Which solutions these can be is something experts can discuss and engineers can develop. To facilitate such discussion, and enabling a low cost experimentation of the alternatives, the paper proposes computer simulations reproducing the daily activities and the interplay of users and assisting solutions. This paper contributes with examples of such simulations and discusses how real solutions can be built upon them in the case of Alzheimer's. The work has been developed with the PHAT/SociAALML framework and the code is available online for interested researchers.",

abstract = "With frequent severe haze and smog episodes in Chinese cities, an increasing number of studies have focused on estimating the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on public health. However, the current use of national and provincial demographic data might mask regional differences and lead to inaccurate estimations of pollution-related health impacts across cities. We applied the Global Burden of Disease methodology to develop a dataset of premature deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5 in 129 Chinese cities in 2006, 2010 and 2015, based on the information of baseline mortality rates and population densities at the city level. Our results suggested that ambient PM2.5 pollution led to 631,230 (95% confidence interval: 281,460–873,800) premature deaths in those cities in 2015, which was similar to that in 2010, but 42.8% higher than that in 2006. The reduction of premature deaths was not as obvious as the improvement in air quality in recent years, primarily owing to the aging Chinese population. For large and medium/small cities, the effects of PM2.5 abatement on alleviating public health burdens were lower than those for megalopolises and metropolises; however, such large and medium/small cities are at risk of increasing future PM2.5 pollution levels due to rapid development. Significant differences in PM2.5-induced premature deaths indicated the need for specific policies to mitigate the health burden of air pollution in different types of Chinese cities.",

abstract = "The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.",

abstract = "The increase in the prevalence of heart disease has become a serious public health issue. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are two main modifiable health risk factors for heart disease. In a fast ageing society, proper preventive measures should be adopted, particularly to achieve healthy aging. The objective of the present study is to examine the factors affecting the use of two health tests, namely blood cholesterol and blood pressure screenings among adults aged 60 years and above in Malaysia. Nationally representative data collected through the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 (NHMS, 2011) by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia were analysed. The survey used a two-stage stratified sampling method. Enumeration Blocks were selected in the first stage, while the second stage involved selection of Living Quarters. The proportions of those not using the blood cholesterol (45.4%) and blood pressure (30.8%) tests are alarmingly high. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the determinants of the use of these two health screening tests. The results show that education, ethnicity, location of residence, employment status, health insurance and smoking significantly affect the decision of the aged population to undergo these tests. Key findings are, first, time is a more dominant factor than income in determining health screening behaviour among the aged population. Second, being covered by insurance increases the propensity to undergo health screening. Third, smokers have a lower likelihood of screening than non-smokers. The findings suggest that intervention programmes should be targeted at the less-educated, employed individuals, individuals not covered by health insurance and smokers.",

The growingly diverse aging population presents a challenge for the geriatric workforce, particularly its capacity to effectively respond to the sociocultural and linguistic needs of ethnic minority older adults. Informed by research on the importance of culturally-competent care in reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, this study sought to understand the meaning of healthy aging from the perspectives of Korean American, Vietnamese American, and Latino older adults.
Methods
Interviews were conducted with 30 participants recruited from community-based organizations in Southern California.
Results
Several dimensions emerged in the participants' understanding of healthy aging: (1) having good physical and mental health (2) optimism and acceptance; (3) social connectedness; (4) taking charge of one's health; and (5) independence and self-worth.
Conclusions
Results could inform the development of a culturally-responsive geriatric healthcare system that takes into account older adults' beliefs, preferences, and needs to promote successful aging.",

Data from three nation-wide community-based surveys, which were conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2015 were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed for 2015 data to identify factors associated with healthcare utilisation.
Results
Analysis noted increasing trends in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity from 1996 to 2015. Decreasing trends were noted in the prevalence of current smokers and drinkers over this 20-year period, whereas health service utilisation increased with age in all surveys. In 2015, both inpatient and outpatient care are significantly associated with increasing age and diabetes.
Conclusions
Increasing trends of health problems and healthcare utilisation were observed among older people in Malaysia. Policymakers should plan for appropriate resources to meet the challenges of an ageing population in Malaysia.",

abstract = "Three decades of rapid economic development in China have not only benefited millions of Chinese by improving their living standards but have also dramatically increased the number of people who are part of the country's aging population. However, economic growth has not been accompanied by sufficient attention given to important public health issues, including an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases and a decline in physical activity (PA) that comes with an aging population. The rapid growth in China's older population will soon exert an impact on the nation's economy, population health status, and health behaviors, and will increase stress on its healthcare system. This review article provides a broad perspective on the impact of rapid economic development, industrialization, and urbanization on health-related behaviors, with a specific focus on PA among older adults. Specifically, the article offers an overview of the demographic context, significant public health challenges, evidence on PA and exercise interventions, and knowledge gaps and future directions for research.",

The quality of life in aging and the cost for the health care system require actions to promote healthy aging. In this regard, several risk factors associated with the development of neurodegeneration can be identified, and programs to educate people on the key role of prevention could significantly ameliorate the future picture of the aging population. Here we describe the key role of the pre- and postnatal period of life during the first 1000 days of life, focusing on the importance of nutrition and a healthy lifestyle of mother and offspring for the prevention of neurodegeneration later in life. Environmental risk factors (i.e., nutrition, stress, xenobiotics, alcohol, drugs, smoking, etc.) mediate the genetic and epigenetic signature of offspring which may have long-term effects on the onset of neurodegeneration.",

Despite its public health importance, there is a significant lack of knowledge about PA in older Chinese adults that may hamper primary prevention efforts of health promotion in an increasingly aging population. To fill this gap, this article presents a narrative review of PA in the older Chinese adult population with a special focus on residential settings (i.e., urban and rural). Using existing studies, the review examines overall PA patterns and their correlates and discusses public health implications and future research. Although there are some preliminary indications of urban and rural differences in PA in the aging population in China, continued research efforts are needed to facilitate primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing noncommunicable diseases and promoting an active lifestyle among the largest population of older people in the world.",

Our empirical findings demonstrate that health care expenditure and its determinants are non-stationary, and revealed the existence of a long run relationship among variables. Furthermore, the estimation results suggest that income is not the only driver of health expenditure in the Arab world countries in the long run. Other variables such as medical progress and ageing population are also playing an important role in the increase of health care expenditure with major policy implications for the region in the long run. Furthermore, the results support that health care expenditure is a necessity good for the three income groups. Finally, the Pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test shows evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between health care expenditures and income for the full sample, as well as for the groups income.",

abstract = "Objectives
Patient portals have the potential to increase patient engagement. Older patients are of particular interest as they are likely to suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Yet, questions remain about how patient portals are perceived and deemed useful by older adults. This study explored attitudes toward, perceived utility of, and requirements of a patient portal from the perspective of older adults.
Methods
We used a mixed-method approach integrating online surveys, a review of existing portals, and participatory design workshops with 17 people who were 65 years old and over.
Results
The findings demonstrate that the participants used a patient portal primarily as one of the communication channels to interact with their providers, rather than as a tool for accessing and managing personal health information. Consequently, the perception of whether or not a provider would use the patient portal was a primary factor that older adults considered in determining the adoption and use of a portal.
Conclusions
It is important to understand that older adults would perceive a patient portal as one part of a larger communication system to interact with a provider. This finding will help researchers and practitioners to advance the design and use of a patient portal to effectively incorporate it into older adults’ health care and better serve the unique needs of the ageing population.",

But how can countries make this a reality in the face of a limited budget and an aging population? Since 2008, China has been rolling out an ambitious reform program, which aims to achieve affordable health insurance coverage for all Chinese citizens. Under this reform program, Chinese living in rural areas are eligible to enroll in a subsidized scheme called the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS). Using a three stage game model involving a government, a private fund manager and population, we explore the impact of population aging on NCMS. Our model highlights the role of government regulation and subsidy in ensuring operation efficiency of the system. We show that at optimality the government sets the operating framework for the fund manager to constrain the potential for monopoly profits. The Government subsidizes the scheme to prevent an adverse selection death spiral. However, the effectiveness of the subsidy in achieving this goal is moderated by the age structure of the population. Our model gives insights into the strengths of the NCMS framework and also can be used to support decisions about resource allocation and understand how scheme dynamics may unfold as the Chinese population ages further.",

This study is to longitudinally investigate the association between grip strength and mental health disorders in middle aged and aged population from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging.
Methods
Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) from 2006 to 2016 was assessed using longitudinal data analysis and out of the 9279 research subjects gathered 1549 (16.7%) participants were reported as Q1 group and 2074 (22.4%) participants were reported as Q5 group. To analyze the association between grip strength and mental health disorders, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used.
Results
The association between grip strength and cognitive decline was statistically significant, with the following Odds ratio (OR) predicting decreased cognitive decline: OR = 4.99 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. The association between grip strength and MMSE and CESD was also statistically significant, with the following estimate (B) predicting decreased MMSE score: B = −0.12 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. In terms of CESD, CESD score was higher for Q1 group (B = 0.34, p < .0001) compared to Q5 group.
Conclusion
This study shows a significant association between grip strength and risk of mental illness in Korean middle aged and aged population. Therefore, grip strength should be given more focus in terms of resistance training programs.",

abstract = "Background
The ageing population and growing burden of chronic disease has increased demands for primary health care services, necessitating growth of this nursing workforce. Studies have explored strategies in retaining nurses, employment conditions in primary health care, and transitioning of acute care nurses to primary health care employment. Few studies have explored how undergraduate nursing students perceive and are prepared to work in this sector.
Aim
This review synthesises evidence on the impact of undergraduate curriculum on nursing students’ attitudes, perceptions and preparedness to work in primary health care.
Design
An integrative literature review guided the synthesis of evidence.
Data sources
Scopus, ScienceDirect, CINAHL and MEDLINE were searched for relevant studies published between 2008 and 2018.
Review methods
491 studies were identified from the database searches. Following the removal of duplicates, review of abstracts and keywords against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 papers were subjected to full-text review. Twelve papers, including one thesis, met the inclusion criteria. Using an appraisal system, no paper was excluded based on methodological quality.
Results
Three themes were identified, namely: impact of curricula; knowledge and attitudes to primary health care; and students’ intention to work in primary health care. The preparation of undergraduate nursing students to work in this area is inconsistent as curricula remain acute-care focussed. Negative perceptions about the primary health care nursing role impact intentions of nursing students to work in primary health care.
Conclusion
This review highlights a need to implement strategies to improve the understanding of undergraduate nurses around the primary health care nursing role. In particular, providing students with skills, knowledge and an understanding of working in this area through curriculum content and structure may provide undergraduates with the desire and confidence to seek employment in primary health care following graduation.",

abstract = "This study explores longitudinal relationships between material, psycho-social and behavioural social determinants of health and multimorbidity of people aged 50 years or older in England. We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected biannually between 2002 and 2015. Apart from the basic measure of multimorbidity (two or more diseases within a person) we constructed two distinct measures of health in order to take into account the biology of ageing (complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations). We found that the likelihood of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations was consistently associated with the levels of household wealth, sense of control over one's life, physical activity and loneliness. Larger health inequalities were observed when health was measured as complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations than basic multimorbidity. Compared to the population group with the highest wealth, those with the lowest wealth had 47% higher odds of basic multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.34-1.61), 73% higher odds of complex multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.52-1.96) and 90% higher odds of having 10 or more functional limitations (95% C.I. 1.59-2.26). We did not find a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption, smoking and multimorbidity but rather evidence of people in ill health actively moderating their health behaviour. We suggest that materialist models of multimorbidity and functional limitation at older age can not, on their own, explain the health inequalities as the behavioural and psycho-social factors play an important role. Policies aiming to reduce the risk of multimorbidity and functional limitation should address the issue at these three levels simultaneously, using the existing national infrastructure of General Practices.",

abstract = "Objectives
Co-occurring chronic diseases are associated with functional limitations, particularly for the aging population ≥50 years old. Aging offenders (individual who are imprisoned) tend to have greater prevalence of chronic, mental health, and substance use disorders compared to non-imprisoned populations. Our primary aim was to determine patterns of co-occurring conditions associated with functional limitations among aging offenders.
Materials and methods
We included all male offenders from one correctional system who were ≥50 years old (n = 2270) and extracted diagnoses for chronic diseases, mental health, substance use disorders, and functional limitations from an electronic health record. We performed a principal factor analysis (PFA) to identify patterns and chi-square to determine if the multimorbid population (≥3 diagnoses) differed from peer groups in regard to functional limitations.
Results
Three patterns (chronic diseases, geriatric conditions, and mental health/substance use) emerged from PFA. Functional limitations were associated with the chronic disease pattern (p = .03) where the multimorbid group compared to non-multimorbid peers had 1.5 odds, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1], for having a physical impairment. The geriatric (p = .10) and mental health/substance use disorders (p = .07) patterns were not associated with having a functional limitation compared to the population without multiple diagnoses. Controlling for multimorbidity, functional limitations, and overlapping patterns, increasing age was the only significant factor (p = .02) associated with having a physical impairment.
Conclusion
The chronic disease pattern was consistent with investigations that included non-imprisoned populations. However, the geriatric pattern was not significant, which was unexpected.",

ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

Driving, being driven by a spouse/partner and taking public transport were independently associated with better indicators of social participation and psychosocial wellbeing versus relying on lifts from family/friends. Non-drivers and less frequent drivers had poorer outcomes versus current drivers. These results highlight the importance of being able to travel independently whether by car or public transport.

Complex adaptive systems of this kind have been shown to evolve into a precarious state between order and disorder in which remote triggers can lead to cascading failure. The healthcare stresses of ageing populations, emerging infectious diseases and treatment-resistant pathogens continue to grow. However, the economic drive for leaner systems and supply chains, and their increasing interdependencies (power, water, food, fuel etc.), all contribute to the growing fragility of public health. When systems are stressed (during emergencies or disasters), accountability for effective resource use requires that health decision making switch from optimal care of individuals to a resource-conserving mode designed to maximise outcomes for the population. Understanding when and how to operate under such conditions, demands that decision makers have a strong grasp of system capacities, limitations and the beneficial or deleterious effects of parameters they are able to manipulate. These difficulties lie behind a growing effort to model health systems to inform planning and (more aspirationally) support real-time decision making. However, modelling efforts to date have been less than optimally founded and structured. Our purpose in this paper is to reframe conceptual approaches to the strategic modelling of health systems and their dependencies in order to point the way to a more productive path for health sector decision-support modelling.",

abstract = "Objective
In aging populations, a growing number of individuals are affected by cancer. However, the relevance of the disease for mental health is still controversial, especially after treatment. We drew from a representative community sample to explore the link of cancer with mental health assessing different dimensions and different periods of time.
Methods
A cohort of 14,375 men and women (35–74 years) underwent medical assessments and was queried about cancer history, previous diagnoses of mental disorders, current mental distress symptoms, and current subjective health appraisal.
Results
1066 participants (7.4%) reported a diagnosis of cancer (survival time M = 9.79 (SD = 9.07) years). Most common were breast (24.3%), skin (20.9%), gynecological (13.8%), and prostate cancer (12.9%). Based on cut-off-scores of standardized self-report scales (PHQ-9, GAD-2), rates of depression (8.4%; 95%CI 6.90–10.30) and anxiety symptoms (7.8%; 95%CI 6.30–9.60) corresponded to those of participants without cancer. In men, cancer was related to a lifetime diagnosis of depression (OR = 2.15; 95%CI 1.25–3.64). At the time of assessment, cancer was associated with reduced subjective health in both sexes and with anxiety symptoms in men (OR = 2.43; 95%CI 1.13–4.98).
Conclusion
Findings indicate different relations of cancer in men and in women with different operationalizations of mental health. They underscore that a history of cancer is not universally linked to distress in the general population. The study points out that different ascertainments of the association of cancer and mental health might be traced back to different assessment strategies. It also notes potential targets for interventions to alleviate distress, e.g. by physical activity.",

To track the trends in general health indicators and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), high blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol in the middle-aged urban population in the Czech Republic in 1998–2010.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
The following data from the three-phase HELEN (HEalth – Lifestyle – ENvironment) study, a prevalence questionnaire survey, were analysed: data collected from 8214 subjects in phase I, 6107 subjects in phase II, and 4389 subjects in phase III. The study subjects were aged 45–54 years and the study period spanned from 1998 to 2010. The differences in the indicators between phases were evaluated by binary and ordinal logistic regression models at a significance level of 0.01.
Results
Over the study period, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of respondents who self-rated their health as very good or good: from 46.6% to 51.0% in males (P = 0.006) and from 45.5% to 49.9% in females (P < 0.001). At the same time, the rates of respondents under long-term medical follow-up rose significantly from 36.3% to 44.3% (P < 0.001) and from 46.4% to 56.2% (P < 0.001), respectively. CVD prevalence did not change although the percentage of males and females with high blood pressure (from 29.3% to 36.6% and from 26.0% to 31.2%, respectively) and elevated total cholesterol (from 29.0% to 36.6% and from 27.3% to 32.4%, respectively) increased significantly.
Conclusions
Self-rated health among the middle-aged population in the Czech Republic improved during the 1998–2010 period, but, at the same time, more people needed to be followed up for a disease. The proportions of respondents with hypertension and elevated blood cholesterol increased while the CVD rates did not vary significantly.",

abstract = "Given South Korea's rapidly aging population, mental health and quality of life (QoL) in older adults are increasingly becoming important. Self-compassion (SC), defined as extending compassion to oneself in times of suffering, has been found to have associations with positive mental health outcomes. This study was performed to examine associations between self-compassion and mental health symptoms, sleep disturbance, life satisfaction, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) among older Korean adults. The participants in this cross-sectional study included 203 older Korean adults aged 65 and over. Findings of this study suggest that self-compassion in older adults protects them from developing mental health and sleep disturbance symptoms while enhancing their life satisfaction, self-care, and usual activities. Therefore, interventions fostering self-compassion may benefit older adults’ mental health and quality of life.",

Energy efficiency improvements of homes may benefit health and access to affordable energy, yet better knowledge about contextual mechanisms and household practices is needed for the development of effective programs. This paper presents a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled retrofit trial targeting low-income older householders. Socio-technical systems thinking offered a useful approach to explore the construct of the engineering-dominated concept of residential energy efficiency in combination with the people-focused experience of housing and health. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain health, energy cost, temperature and psycho-social outcomes for winter. The findings showed that small retrofits may mitigate the growing energy demands of this ageing population group, provide better comfort and reduce energy costs, but that the effectiveness of the retrofits was reduced by socially shared heating and ventilation practices that contradicted engineering assumptions, the physiological capabilities of the householder and the modes of energy bill payments. A program that is framed around caring and safety and combines retrofits, tariff optimisations and householder practices could provide equitable climate change mitigation outcomes and co-benefits for health for this population group. The paper concludes with implications for the integration of equity and health as goals into low carbon transitions.",

The RHS was described as an opportunity to holistically care for a person across the care continuum, address social determinants of health, develop new models of care, and work with social and community partners. Challenges to RHS implementation included difficulties aligning the goals, values, and priorities of multiple actors, the need for better integration across clusters, differing care capabilities and capacities across partners, healthcare financing structures that may not reflect RHS goals, scalability and evaluation of pilot programmes, and disease-centricity, provider-centricity, and medicalisation in health and healthcare. Suggested ways forward included building relationships between actors to facilitate integration; exploring innovative new models of care; clear long-term/scale-up plans for successful pilots; healthcare financing reforms to meet changing patient and population needs; and developing evaluation systems reflective of RHS principles and priorities.",

The rapid increase in the aged population has resulted in a growing number of cases of chronic diseases. This increase is an important demographic change that low- and middle-income countries have to face and poses a new challenge to health services. One of the first steps to formulate public policies is to understand the reality of each country's aging population. This study describes the prevalence of anemia, hypertension and diabetes and the overall health status in pre-elderly and elderly subjects enrolled in two primary health care clinics, Eldorado and Piraporinha, in the city of Diadema, São Paulo.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 373 participants. Clinical data were collected from patient charts and the degree of disability and common mental disorders, as well as demographic data were obtained by interviews.
Results
The prevalence of anemia was approximately 11% and hypertension was 70% and 81% in Eldorado and Piraporinha, respectively. The frequency of diabetes was 52% in Eldorado and 30% in Piraporinha. The subjects of both health care clinics reported having difficulties in some of their daily physical and instrumental activities, with physical symptoms and emotional disorders.
Conclusion
Anemia, hypertension and diabetes are prevalent in the studied population, and patients showed degrees of dependency and impaired health status.",

The purpose of this research work is to explore the patients’ perceptions and experiences of self-management of diabetes in the rural area of Pakistan and to better understand differences in diabetes self-management among men and women living with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as the barriers and challenges of self-management of diabetes.
Methods
30 participants were recruited from a medical centre at Al-Rehman hospital at Abbottabad, Pakistan. Qualitative method was used to conduct interviews of n=30 patients with Type 2 diabetes using a semi-structured interview approach with audio recording to explore their perceptions and experiences of the self-management of type 2 diabetes and the factors that influence the management of diabetes.
Results
The qualitative analyses revealed six themes: stigma attached to the disease; self-management in context; patient-doctor relationship; adherence to diet and exercise; access to diabetes resources; and social support. Women were more adaptable to diabetic conditions, disclosed their diabetes more readily and are a lot more ready to integrate management into their daily lives, whereas men were more reluctant to tell friends and family about their diabetes due to the stigma attached to the disease and were less observant of self-management practices in social settings. Women used socially interactive resources such as internet access and education classes whereas men relied more on self-directed learning and wanted the guidance of health professionals. Finally, both men and women reported lack of support from the health care practitioners and families in managing their diabetes.
Conclusions
The results of this qualitative research highlighted the challenges of diabetes self-management among men and women in the rural area of Pakistan and barriers to self-management. These findings may help to inform gender-sensitive diabetes self-management approach, diabetes awareness in the population, counselling and support.",

This Series paper describes the current state of cancer control in Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs). PICTs are diverse but face common challenges of having small, geographically dispersed, isolated populations, with restricted resources, fragile ecological and economic systems, and overburdened health services. PICTs face a triple burden of infection-related cancers, rapid transition to lifestyle-related diseases, and ageing populations; additionally, PICTs are increasingly having to respond to natural disasters associated with climate change. In the Pacific region, cancer surveillance systems are generally weaker than those in high-income countries, and patients often present at advanced cancer stage. Many PICTs are unable to provide comprehensive cancer services, with some patients receiving cancer care in other countries where resources allow. Many PICTs do not have, or have poorly developed, cancer screening, pathology, oncology, surgical, and palliative care services, although some examples of innovative cancer planning, prevention, and treatment approaches have been developed in the region. To improve cancer outcomes, we recommend prioritising regional collaborative approaches, enhancing cervical cancer prevention, improving cancer surveillance and palliative care services, and developing targeted treatment capacity in the region.",

In Portugal, the cumulative effect of the reduction in mortality and birth rates has resulted in an ageing population. The ageing population will create in the medium term a new dynamic of recruitment in various sectors, including health. With increased life expectancy, the care of chronically ill has become an important area in the context of health services, since they need to be increasingly more focused on the need to provide palliative rather than curative care. Rationalization of resources must be a goal so that waste is minimized. The present model of palliative care ceases to respond to the pressing needs. What to do, to adapt to the changes brought by demographic change and by innovation? What models should be adopted for better resource optimization in palliative care? A literature review was carried out, including articles that compared the main differences between hospital and home care. Portugal has a multi-sectoral palliative care model, in light of what happens in reference countries, however, a better rationalization of resources will be required in order to ensure optimization in the distribution of patients. We also conclude that there is a gap between the patient's will and what is recommended. To respect the individual preferences of the patient, it is necessary to develop quality home-based palliative care services, focusing on training and the expansion of field teams.",

abstract = "Background
The human population is aging. A systematic summary of the epidemiology of skin diseases in the aged is lacking.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted including electronic database searches in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The eligibility criteria were primary incidence and prevalence studies or secondary data analysis, English or German language, subjects being 65+ years and reported skin problems or diseases. Data extraction was conducted using a standardized data collection form and the methodological quality of included studies was assessed.
Results
After screening of 1491 records, 74 records were included reporting data for more than 20 skin conditions. The majority of prevalence and incidence figures was identified for hospital and long-term care settings. The most prevalent skin diseases were fungal infections (14.3%–64%), dermatitis (1%–58.7%), xerosis (5.4%–85.5%) and benign skin tumors (1.7%–74.5%). Additionally, pressure ulcer prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 46% and incidence from 0.8% to 34%.
Conclusion
Skin conditions and diseases in aged populations are frequent. Health care practitioners should pay attention to those, although skin conditions might not be the primary reason for seeking care. Epidemiological data are lacking especially for home care and community settings although this can be regarded as the most important from a public health and prevention point of view. The methodological quality and reporting of epidemiological studies in the aged populations must be improved.

abstract = "Background and objectives
Detailed information about the current and future geographic distribution of Australia's frail population provides critical evidence to inform policy, resource allocation and planning initiatives that aim to treat and reverse frailty. Frailty is associated with poor health outcomes, including disability and death. It is also characterised by increased health care usage and costs. Understanding the distribution and growth of frailty is important for planning and budgeting service provision and health interventions aimed to support the needs of Australia's growing ageing population. The objective of this research is to provide baseline mapping and area level population estimates of Australia's current and future frail and pre-frail populations.
Research design and methods
Geospatial modelling was applied to national frailty prevalence rates to provide estimates of the size, distribution and potential growth of Australia's frail and pre-frail population.
Results
It is estimated that in 2016 approximately 415,769 people living in Australia aged 65 years or more are frail and almost 1.7 million people are pre-frail. In future years, as the population ages, these figures will increase rapidly, reaching 609,306 frail and 2,248,977 pre-frail by 2027, if prevalence continues at current levels. The geographic distribution of this projected growth is not uniform and while the largest frail populations will continue to be located in the major cities, the fastest growth will be in the outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas.
Discussion and implications
The projected growth of frail populations in outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas may be reduced by targeting health interventions in these areas and improving access to support services. Frailty is a dynamic condition that is amenable to intervention. Reducing frailty will lead to benefits in wellbeing for older Australians in addition to reductions in health care costs.",

Primary care-based preventive visits such as the Medicare annual wellness visit can be used with older adults to enhance health promotion efforts. A scoping review of studies was conducted to identify current evidence concerning the impact of this visit on preventive practices, risk reduction and lifestyle behavior changes for community-dwelling older adults.

However, the characteristics of green structures have been overlooked in previous studies, and the mediation effects of green structures on the suicide rate have not been analyzed. To evaluate the mediation impacts of green structures (patch area, fragmentation, and patch distance), this study explored the potential pathways and effects of green structures on the suicide rate using partial least squares modeling with data from Taiwan. Other factors influencing the suicide rate, such as economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were also considered in the model. The results revealed a negative association between the suicide rate and patch area (standardized total effect coefficient (STEC) = −0.42), but there were positive associations with fragmentation (STEC = 0.14), and patch distance (STEC = 0.35) of green structures. Therefore, maximizing the patch area, and minimizing fragmentation and patch distance can contribute to a reduction in the suicide rate. Fragmentation minimization was found to be crucial for both genders, while patch-area maximization and patch-distance minimization were only influential for females. Moreover, economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were influential for both genders. This is the first study to consider the direct and indirect pathways and effects of the green structure on suicide rate. Instead of considering only the area covered by green spaces, it was found that other characteristics of green structures should also be considered when formulating greening policies.",

Of ∼10.2 million people with chronic HCV infection in Europe, 6.7 million live in Eastern Europe, 2.3 million in Western Europe and 1.2 million in Central Europe. HCV transmission continues to occur in parallel with an increasing HCV-related liver disease burden, the result of an ageing population infected during peak HCV epidemics decades earlier. In 2016, the World Health Organization set targets to eliminate HCV infection as a major public health threat by 2030. Across Europe, an estimated 36% of those living with chronic HCV infection have been diagnosed and ∼5% have been treated. A major barrier to enhancing HCV treatment uptake has been restrictions set by payers, including national governments and others, in response to the initially high list prices of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. The aims of this article are to discuss DAA restrictions in Europe, why DAA restrictions are still in place, what has facilitated the removal of DAA restrictions, and what challenges remain as we attempt to eliminate HCV as a major public health threat in the region by 2030.",

At the global level, cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality rates are increasing. These trends are not fully explained by a growing and ageing population: with marked regional and socioeconomic disparities, lifestyle factors, the resources dedicated to preventive medicine, and the occupational and environmental control of hazardous chemicals all playing a role. While it is difficult to establish the contribution of chemical exposure to the societal burden of cancer, a number of measures can be taken to better assess the carcinogenic properties of chemicals and manage their risks. This paper discusses how these measures can be informed not only by the traditional data streams of regulatory toxicology, but also by using new toxicological assessment methods, along with indicators of public health status based on biomonitoring. These diverse evidence streams have the potential to form the basis of an integrated and more effective approach to cancer prevention.",

abstract = "Background
Empirical evidence suggests that multimorbidity and disability are each significantly associated with out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures; however few efforts have been made to explore their joint association with OOP health expenditures.
Objectives
To estimate the association of multimorbidity and disability with OOP health expenditures in households with older adults in Mexico, as well as the potential interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability on OOP health expenditures.
Methods
Longitudinal study based on data collected as part of the Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2009) and Wave 2 (2014), a nationally representative study in Mexico with a sample of older adults aged 50 and older. The dependent variable was OOP health expenditures, and main exposure variables were multimorbidity and disability. Two-Part regression models were used to analyze the relation between multimorbidity, disability and OOP health expenditures.
Results
Multimorbidity was associated with the probability of incurring OOP health expenditures (OR = 1.28, CI95% 1.11–1.48), and also the tertiles of disability (2nd tertile: OR = 1.45, CI95% 1.23–1.70; 3rd tertile: OR = 2.19, CI95% 1.81–2.66). The presence of multimorbidity was associated with an increase of 13% in average OOP health costs (β = 0.13, CI95% 0.01–0.25), and 16% for the 3rd tertile of disability (β = 0.16, CI95% 0.01–0.31). We did not find significant interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability.
Conclusions
Multimorbidity and disability appear to be important determinants of OOP health expenditures. The economic implications for the households and the health system should be highlighted, particularly in low- and middle-income countries because of the rapid growth of their aging populations.",

abstract = "Before 1990, Germany was divided for more than 40 years. While divided, significant mortality disparities between the populations of East and West Germany emerged. In the years following reunification, East German mortality improved considerably, eventually converging with West German levels. In this study, we explore changes in the gender differences in health at ages 20–59 across the eastern and western regions of Germany using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the 1990–2013 period. We apply random-effects linear regressions to the SOEP data to identify trends in health, measured as self-assessed health satisfaction, after German reunification. The findings indicate that women were substantially less satisfied with their health than men in both West and East Germany, but that the gender gap was larger in East Germany than in West Germany. Furthermore, the results show that respondents’ satisfaction with their health decreased over time, and that the decline was steeper among men – and particularly among East German men – than among women. Thus, the initial male advantage in health in East and West Germany in the years immediately after reunification diminished over time, and even reversed to become a female advantage in East Germany. One interpretation of this finding is that stress-inducing post-reunification changes in the political and social landscape of East Germany had lasting damaging consequences for men’s health. Ongoing risky health behaviors and high levels of economic insecurity due to unemployment could have had long-lasting effects on the health of the working-aged population. A partial explanation for our finding that health declined more sharply among East German men than among their female counterparts could be that women have better compensatory mechanisms than men for dealing with psychosocial stress.",

The data generated were examined for age- and sex-related differences in order to gain information about the dietary habits and socio-economic structures of the period with the goal of identifying potential diachronic changes. The results indicated that dietary habits changed over the course of the Neolithic period: the prevalence of caries significantly decreased between the Early and Late Neolithic. The adults from the Early Neolithic sample, particularly those from the LBK bore the highest rate of caries. This highlights the essential importance of cereals in the diet of the early farmers in the Middle Elbe-Saale region. As time went on, meat and dairy products became more and more important, which had a positive impact on dental health. The data also show sex-specific differences: women were more often affected by caries than men and female jaws also generally exhibited greater numbers of carious teeth than their male counterparts. Dental health is a reflection of both biological factors and of economic and sociocultural structures.",

There is no screening service for osteoporotic fractures in the UK and physicians must actively identify patients who are at risk of osteoporotic fractures as well as managing appropriately patients who have sustained osteoporotic fractures. Diagnosis of osteoporosis is done with Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure Bone Mineral Density (BMD). The World Health Organisation Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) score is used to identify patients who are at risk of fractures. Pharmacological treatment is recommended for those who obtain a risk score sufficient enough to warrant treatment. The treatment of osteoporosis includes calcium and vitamin D replacement, bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide and hormone replacement therapy in women. Potential therapies that are currently undergoing clinical trials include Abaloparatide and Romosozumab.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the hospitalization rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in a southern-european country and its associated charges over a period of 16 years.
Methods
We identified all discharges with a primary diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) between 2000 and 2015 in data provided by the Central Administration of Health Services (ACSS). National estimates of hospitalization rates were assessed and adjusted to gender, age, population, and hospitalizations. Hospitalization charges were also assessed.
Results
There were an estimated 31 358 and 16 669 discharges for CD and UC, respectively. From 2000 to 2015, hospitalization rates per 100000 habitants increased for CD (8.4–11.2) and remained stable for UC (4.4–4.9). The hospitalization rate for IBD increased slightly over time (12.8 per 100 000 habitants in 2000 and 16.1 in 2015). Annual total hospitalization charges amounted to 4.0M€ in 2000 and 5.7M€ in 2015. This increase was mainly due to a rise in the total expenses of CD-related hospitalizations.
Conclusion
CD hospitalization rates per 100000 inhabitants increased over time while remaining constant for UC. Hospitalization charges for IBD increased approximately 2.0M€ during the study period, representing an important burden in the national healthcare system.",

The relative percentage of older people is growing, while fewer young employees are entering the labour force. This phenomenon is directly connected with ageing of the workforce. Older workers constitute a special group with characteristics that require special attention from the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) point of view. The aim of this paper is to address what changes occur in ageing workers as a result of physical and psychological processes and the possible impacts of these at work in relation to OHS and the concept of sustainable work and workplaces. In addition, this paper discusses factors affecting work ability and worker’s performance in relation to the ageing phenomenon. Finally, based on the literature, the paper proposes measures to minimize age-related risks and increase awareness. These measures should be designed and adopted at the early stages of working life and continue until retirement. By reducing risk factors of employees, the rate of occupational accidents and occupational diseases may be decreased, thus saving costs for employers, health system and insurance costs, while simultaneously facilitating a healthier retirement for the working-age population.",

The possibility to reach high coverage with immunizations that can guarantee a fundamental improvement of health for adults and the elderly can only be achieved through a coordinated effort where all stakeholders, under the coordination of public health, contribute to issue recommendations; create a functioning database for vaccine coverage registration; promote formative courses for healthcare workers and continuous information for the public; increase vaccines uptake among healthcare workers, who need to give the first testimony on the relevance of immunization.",

abstract = "Background
In the context of a rapidly ageing population, Singapore is anticipating a rise in multimorbidity, disability, and dependency, which are driven by physical frailty. Healthy Older People Everyday (HOPE) is an epidemiologic population-based study on community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older in Singapore.
Objective
To investigate the prevalence of frail and prefrail states and their association with polypharmacy, multimorbidity, cognitive and functional status, and perceived health status among community-dwelling older adults in Singapore.
Methods
Participants for HOPE were older adults aged 65 years and older recruited from a cohort study on the northwest region of Singapore. Analysis was performed on data collected from a combination of interviewer-administered questionnaires (including FRAIL scale, EQ-5D, Mini Mental State Examination, Barthel index, and Lawton IADL scale), clinical assessments, and physical measurements (including hand grip strength and Timed-Up-and-Go [TUG] test).
Results
A total of 1051 older adults (mean age 71.2 years) completed the study. More than half (57.2%) were female. The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty was 6.2% and 37%, respectively. Frailty was associated with older age, female gender, Indian (instead of Chinese) ethnicity, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment, weaker hand grip strength, longer TUG times, and poor perceived health status. Those with underlying cognitive impairment and frailty were at greater risk of adverse health outcome.
Conclusion
Frailty is a complex health state with multiple domains and dimensions. In our study in a multiethnic Asian population, we identified nonmodifiable factors and modifiable risk factors (multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment) that were associated with frailty. Interventions will have to be multipronged and will require a collaborated effort in order to effect change and improve the health span in rapidly ageing populations.",

The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

We investigate whether higher regional employment levels are associated with better health over and above individual level employment. Individual level data (N = 23,078 aged 15–64 years) were taken from 16 countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) participating in the 2014 European Social Survey. Regional employment rates were extracted from Eurostat, corresponding with the start (2008) and end (2013) of the Great Recession. Health outcomes included self-reported heart or circulation problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, self-rated health, depression, obesity and allergies (as a falsification test). We calculated multilevel Poisson regression models, which included individuals nested within regions, controlling for potential confounding variables and country fixed effects. After adjustment for individual level socio-demographic factors, higher average regional employment rates (from 2008 to 2013) were associated with better health outcomes. Individual level worklessness was associated with worsened health outcomes, most strongly with poor self-rated health. In models including both individual worklessness and the average regional employment rate, regional employment remained associated with heart and circulation problems, depression and obesity. There was evidence of an interaction between individual worklessness and regional employment for poor self-rated health and depression. The findings suggest that across 16 European countries, for some key outcomes, higher levels of employment in the regional labour market may be beneficial for the health of the local population.",

abstract = "Background & Aims
Population growth and changes in demographic structure are linked to trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. The aim of this study is to estimate future CRC incidence in the ageing population, and compare trends across developing and developed regions.
Methods
Cancer and population data were extracted from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Annual incidence rates for the major types of cancer in 118 selected populations were extracted from 102 cancer registries in 39 countries worldwide. We selected 8 jurisdictions (from the United States, Europe, and Asia) that reported 20-year cancer incidence rates since 1988. Time series models were constructed to project cancer incidence, by sex and age, to 2030. Incidence rates for persons older than 65 years were combined and further adjusted for change of ageing population. We compared age-adjusted incidence rates among the jurisdictions.
Results
The total population older than 65 years old was 12,917,794 in 1988, and the number increased by almost 40% to 17,950,115 in 2007. In developed countries in the West CRC incidence is predicted to decrease by 16.3% in the United States, increase by 4.8% in the United Kingdom, and increase by 4.7% in Sweden by 2030. In developing countries, such as China (Shanghai), Croatia, and Costa Rica, CRC incidence is predicted to increase in a steep curve by 2030 because of the growing population and ageing effect; in 2030, the incidence increases were 60.5% for China, 47.0% for Croatia, and 18.5% for Costa Rica. We also predict CRC incidence will increase greatly by 2030 in Japan and Hong Kong, which are developed regions.
Conclusions
With the exception of the United States, the incidence of CRC is expected to continue to rise in most regions in the coming decades, due to population growth and changes in demographic structure. The predicted increases are more marked in developing regions with limited health care resources.",

abstract = "Background
Aging populations have led to increasing numbers of seniors presenting for emergency surgery. Older patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization, and increased institutionalization. We hypothesized that increased frailty would be a risk factor for increased health care costs in elderly surgical patients who have undergone emergency abdominal surgery.
Methods
A prospective cost analysis of emergency general surgery patients 65 years of age and older was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Preadmission Clinical Frailty Scale score and Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications were collected. Patients were followed for 6 months after discharge. Hospitalization costs were calculated using the Alberta Health Services (AHS) microcosting database; other costs were obtained from Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health databases. The primary outcome was total insured cost (2016 Can$). Multivariate generalized linear regression of log-transformed costs was conducted.
Results
Overall, 321 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 7.8), median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3, mean length of stay was 15.9 days (standard deviation 23.4), and 48% suffered a complication. Median total insured cost was Can$18,021 and median total cost was Can$26,739. Multivariate analysis found American Society of Anesthesiologists score (adjusted ratio [AR] = 1.24, P = .001), CFS (AR = 1.27, P < .001), major complications (AR = 2.11, P < .001), and minor complications (AR = 1.48, P < .001) lead to increased total insured costs.
Conclusion
Costs increased—after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and preadmission function as frailty—and American Society of Anesthesiologists score increased if minor or major complications occurred. The detection of frailty represents an opportunity to target risk-reduction strategies and interventions to improve outcomes and decrease cost.",

abstract = "Background
Few studies consider multiple pathways for explaining the gendered patterns of depression in Europe’s aged population, although ageing is often associated with an increased exposure to risk factors for depression, and the relevance of these risk factors is likely to differ between countries.
Methods
Based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we assess the relevance of gender inequalities in the exposure to psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors for explaining the gender gap in depression. Further, we investigate the association between depressive symptoms and these explanatory variables by gender and analyse whether their relevance differs between countries.
Results
Both the prevalence of depression by gender and the magnitude of the gender gap were low in Northern Europe and rather high in Southern Europe. Part of the gender gap was explained by psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors but significant gender differences remained. Health-related factors were of outstanding importance for explaining within-country variation in depressive symptoms for both women and men. With regard to psychosocial and socio-economic factors, the results were less clear.
Conclusion
The assessment of gender inequalities in depression and their determinants within different social policy contexts enables evidence-based interventions to reduce the gender gap and ensure high quality of life for older men and women. To that end, the reduction of health-related risk factors seems to be of utmost importance in all European countries, whereas interventions in the area of socio-economic and psychosocial risk factors should be gender- and context-specific.",

Although Israel is still young in years, with relatively high birth rates and older people (individuals aged 65 years or older) constituting only about 11% of its population, the absolute number of older people is growing rapidly. Life expectancy is high, and increasing numbers of people are living to advanced old age (older than 85 years). A wide spectrum of geriatric care is provided within a universal system providing health services to all citizens. Community and institutional care is available, and many innovative programmes are being developed. The unique demographic characteristics of the ageing society in Israel reflect cultural and multiethnic diversity, in addition to a high rate of immigration of older people. To meet the growing challenges, address disparities, and search for innovation will require planning and development of adequate services at the highest level.",

Whilst pharmacological therapy has improved the associated morbidity and mortality, there is a need for additional therapies to improve the clinical outcome as the death rate remains high.

These behaviors may put patients at risk for harm to self or others and lead to inefficient, ineffective, or inappropriate use of resources. This session aims to engage participants in considering varying definitions of patients with complex needs, and how VHA has worked to understand these needs, identify promising practices, and prepare a workforce capable of meeting these needs. In the first presentation, the presenter will discuss varying conceptualizations of “complex patients” and related challenges for targeted program development and dissemination. An overview of the development, activities, and plans for the VHA Care for Patients with Complex Problems Program will be presented. The audience will be engaged in discussing the challenges for providing geriatric behavioral care across inpatient mental health, nursing home, and rehabilitation care settings, and VHA efforts to develop guidance for teams wishing to enhance capacity to provide geriatric behavioral care in these settings will be shared. A unique program, the Behavioral Recovery Outreach (BRO) Team, that facilitates transitions of care for Veterans with complex behavioral needs from inpatient nursing care to community-based care settings will be described. A closing discussion with the audience will center around the next steps in policy and program development and evaluation needed to meet the needs of aging population with complex care needs.",

Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies and services might be a solution to address those challenges. Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

abstract = "To improve the strain on healthcare systems which happens through an aging population and a rise in chronic illness, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has attracted much attention in recent years. Cloud computing along with the IoT concept is a novel trend, for an efficient management and online processing of sensor data, and its major problem is the protection of privacy. Normally, the data is acquired from the users (i.e. patients) by the healthcare service provider and distributes them with authorized clinics or healthcare experts and these details were distributed to both pharmaceutical and life health insurance companies. Additionally the hackers have susceptible about the data of the patient, at the time of synchronization or cloud transfer is happening with the devices that are interconnected. An efficient Elman Neural Network (ENN) classifier based data protection is given in this work, which forms the cryptography and authentication. This suggested work has two varieties of process namely client side and cloud side. In client side, initially, the EEG signal is obtained from human and is processed with the help of the Hyper analytic Wavelet Transform (HWT) with Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) method. Then, through the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) scheme, signal is safeguarded from forgery. The features were drawn-out from authenticated information in cloud side, and these details were divided as abnormal or not. The appropriateness of this work is validated by executing the technique called One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with IoT that drivens the ECG-dependent health monitoring system in the cloud on both experimental analysis and simulation.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

AAL technologies are used to prevent, cure and improve the wellness and health conditions of the elderly. However, their adoption and use by older adults is still a major challenge. User Experience (UX) evaluations aim at aiding on this task, by identifying the experience that a user has while interacting with an AAL technology under particular conditions. This may help designing better products and improve user engagement and adoption of AAL solutions. However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional UX evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results.",

However, the current use of national and provincial demographic data might mask regional differences and lead to inaccurate estimations of pollution-related health impacts across cities. We applied the Global Burden of Disease methodology to develop a dataset of premature deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5 in 129 Chinese cities in 2006, 2010 and 2015, based on the information of baseline mortality rates and population densities at the city level. Our results suggested that ambient PM2.5 pollution led to 631,230 (95% confidence interval: 281,460–873,800) premature deaths in those cities in 2015, which was similar to that in 2010, but 42.8% higher than that in 2006. The reduction of premature deaths was not as obvious as the improvement in air quality in recent years, primarily owing to the aging Chinese population. For large and medium/small cities, the effects of PM2.5 abatement on alleviating public health burdens were lower than those for megalopolises and metropolises; however, such large and medium/small cities are at risk of increasing future PM2.5 pollution levels due to rapid development. Significant differences in PM2.5-induced premature deaths indicated the need for specific policies to mitigate the health burden of air pollution in different types of Chinese cities.",

abstract = "The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.",

abstract = "The increase in the prevalence of heart disease has become a serious public health issue. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are two main modifiable health risk factors for heart disease. In a fast ageing society, proper preventive measures should be adopted, particularly to achieve healthy aging. The objective of the present study is to examine the factors affecting the use of two health tests, namely blood cholesterol and blood pressure screenings among adults aged 60 years and above in Malaysia. Nationally representative data collected through the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 (NHMS, 2011) by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia were analysed. The survey used a two-stage stratified sampling method. Enumeration Blocks were selected in the first stage, while the second stage involved selection of Living Quarters. The proportions of those not using the blood cholesterol (45.4%) and blood pressure (30.8%) tests are alarmingly high. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the determinants of the use of these two health screening tests. The results show that education, ethnicity, location of residence, employment status, health insurance and smoking significantly affect the decision of the aged population to undergo these tests. Key findings are, first, time is a more dominant factor than income in determining health screening behaviour among the aged population. Second, being covered by insurance increases the propensity to undergo health screening. Third, smokers have a lower likelihood of screening than non-smokers. The findings suggest that intervention programmes should be targeted at the less-educated, employed individuals, individuals not covered by health insurance and smokers.",

The association between depressive symptom during a week and center for epidemiological studies depression (CESD) on cognitive decline was statistically significant, respectively with the following Odds ratio (OR) predicting decreased MMSE score: OR = 0.89 (p < .0001) for 5–7 days vs. less than a day and B = 0.91 (p < .0001) for depression (8–10) vs. healthy (zero). In terms of cognitive decline, depressive symptom was higher for 5–7 days (OR = 3.79, p < .0001) compared to less than a day. This study shows a statistically significant association between depressive disorder and cognitive decline in a Korean middle aged and aged population.

The growingly diverse aging population presents a challenge for the geriatric workforce, particularly its capacity to effectively respond to the sociocultural and linguistic needs of ethnic minority older adults. Informed by research on the importance of culturally-competent care in reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, this study sought to understand the meaning of healthy aging from the perspectives of Korean American, Vietnamese American, and Latino older adults.
Methods
Interviews were conducted with 30 participants recruited from community-based organizations in Southern California.
Results
Several dimensions emerged in the participants' understanding of healthy aging: (1) having good physical and mental health (2) optimism and acceptance; (3) social connectedness; (4) taking charge of one's health; and (5) independence and self-worth.
Conclusions
Results could inform the development of a culturally-responsive geriatric healthcare system that takes into account older adults' beliefs, preferences, and needs to promote successful aging.",

Methods
Data from three nation-wide community-based surveys, which were conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2015 were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed for 2015 data to identify factors associated with healthcare utilisation.
Results
Analysis noted increasing trends in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity from 1996 to 2015. Decreasing trends were noted in the prevalence of current smokers and drinkers over this 20-year period, whereas health service utilisation increased with age in all surveys. In 2015, both inpatient and outpatient care are significantly associated with increasing age and diabetes.
Conclusions
Increasing trends of health problems and healthcare utilisation were observed among older people in Malaysia. Policymakers should plan for appropriate resources to meet the challenges of an ageing population in Malaysia.",

However, economic growth has not been accompanied by sufficient attention given to important public health issues, including an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases and a decline in physical activity (PA) that comes with an aging population. The rapid growth in China's older population will soon exert an impact on the nation's economy, population health status, and health behaviors, and will increase stress on its healthcare system. This review article provides a broad perspective on the impact of rapid economic development, industrialization, and urbanization on health-related behaviors, with a specific focus on PA among older adults.

In this regard, several risk factors associated with the development of neurodegeneration can be identified, and programs to educate people on the key role of prevention could significantly ameliorate the future picture of the aging population. Here we describe the key role of the pre- and postnatal period of life during the first 1000 days of life, focusing on the importance of nutrition and a healthy lifestyle of mother and offspring for the prevention of neurodegeneration later in life. Environmental risk factors (i.e., nutrition, stress, xenobiotics, alcohol, drugs, smoking, etc.) mediate the genetic and epigenetic signature of offspring which may have long-term effects on the onset of neurodegeneration.",

Despite its public health importance, there is a significant lack of knowledge about PA in older Chinese adults that may hamper primary prevention efforts of health promotion in an increasingly aging population. To fill this gap, this article presents a narrative review of PA in the older Chinese adult population with a special focus on residential settings (i.e., urban and rural). Using existing studies, the review examines overall PA patterns and their correlates and discusses public health implications and future research. Although there are some preliminary indications of urban and rural differences in PA in the aging population in China, continued research efforts are needed to facilitate primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing noncommunicable diseases and promoting an active lifestyle among the largest population of older people in the world.",

Our empirical findings demonstrate that health care expenditure and its determinants are non-stationary, and revealed the existence of a long run relationship among variables. Furthermore, the estimation results suggest that income is not the only driver of health expenditure in the Arab world countries in the long run. Other variables such as medical progress and ageing population are also playing an important role in the increase of health care expenditure with major policy implications for the region in the long run. Furthermore, the results support that health care expenditure is a necessity good for the three income groups. Finally, the Pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test shows evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between health care expenditures and income for the full sample, as well as for the groups income.",

This study explored attitudes toward, perceived utility of, and requirements of a patient portal from the perspective of older adults.
Methods
We used a mixed-method approach integrating online surveys, a review of existing portals, and participatory design workshops with 17 people who were 65 years old and over.
Results
The findings demonstrate that the participants used a patient portal primarily as one of the communication channels to interact with their providers, rather than as a tool for accessing and managing personal health information. Consequently, the perception of whether or not a provider would use the patient portal was a primary factor that older adults considered in determining the adoption and use of a portal.
Conclusions
It is important to understand that older adults would perceive a patient portal as one part of a larger communication system to interact with a provider. This finding will help researchers and practitioners to advance the design and use of a patient portal to effectively incorporate it into older adults’ health care and better serve the unique needs of the ageing population.",

But how can countries make this a reality in the face of a limited budget and an aging population? Since 2008, China has been rolling out an ambitious reform program, which aims to achieve affordable health insurance coverage for all Chinese citizens. Under this reform program, Chinese living in rural areas are eligible to enroll in a subsidized scheme called the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS). Using a three stage game model involving a government, a private fund manager and population, we explore the impact of population aging on NCMS. Our model highlights the role of government regulation and subsidy in ensuring operation efficiency of the system. We show that at optimality the government sets the operating framework for the fund manager to constrain the potential for monopoly profits. The Government subsidizes the scheme to prevent an adverse selection death spiral. However, the effectiveness of the subsidy in achieving this goal is moderated by the age structure of the population. Our model gives insights into the strengths of the NCMS framework and also can be used to support decisions about resource allocation and understand how scheme dynamics may unfold as the Chinese population ages further.",

This study is to longitudinally investigate the association between grip strength and mental health disorders in middle aged and aged population from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging.
Methods
Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) from 2006 to 2016 was assessed using longitudinal data analysis and out of the 9279 research subjects gathered 1549 (16.7%) participants were reported as Q1 group and 2074 (22.4%) participants were reported as Q5 group. To analyze the association between grip strength and mental health disorders, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used.
Results
The association between grip strength and cognitive decline was statistically significant, with the following Odds ratio (OR) predicting decreased cognitive decline: OR = 4.99 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. The association between grip strength and MMSE and CESD was also statistically significant, with the following estimate (B) predicting decreased MMSE score: B = −0.12 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. In terms of CESD, CESD score was higher for Q1 group (B = 0.34, p < .0001) compared to Q5 group.
Conclusion
This study shows a significant association between grip strength and risk of mental illness in Korean middle aged and aged population. Therefore, grip strength should be given more focus in terms of resistance training programs.",

abstract = "Background
The ageing population and growing burden of chronic disease has increased demands for primary health care services, necessitating growth of this nursing workforce. Studies have explored strategies in retaining nurses, employment conditions in primary health care, and transitioning of acute care nurses to primary health care employment. Few studies have explored how undergraduate nursing students perceive and are prepared to work in this sector.
Aim
This review synthesises evidence on the impact of undergraduate curriculum on nursing students’ attitudes, perceptions and preparedness to work in primary health care.
Design
An integrative literature review guided the synthesis of evidence.
Data sources
Scopus, ScienceDirect, CINAHL and MEDLINE were searched for relevant studies published between 2008 and 2018.
Review methods
491 studies were identified from the database searches. Following the removal of duplicates, review of abstracts and keywords against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 papers were subjected to full-text review. Twelve papers, including one thesis, met the inclusion criteria. Using an appraisal system, no paper was excluded based on methodological quality.
Results
Three themes were identified, namely: impact of curricula; knowledge and attitudes to primary health care; and students’ intention to work in primary health care. The preparation of undergraduate nursing students to work in this area is inconsistent as curricula remain acute-care focussed. Negative perceptions about the primary health care nursing role impact intentions of nursing students to work in primary health care.
Conclusion
This review highlights a need to implement strategies to improve the understanding of undergraduate nurses around the primary health care nursing role. In particular, providing students with skills, knowledge and an understanding of working in this area through curriculum content and structure may provide undergraduates with the desire and confidence to seek employment in primary health care following graduation.",

We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected biannually between 2002 and 2015. Apart from the basic measure of multimorbidity (two or more diseases within a person) we constructed two distinct measures of health in order to take into account the biology of ageing (complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations). We found that the likelihood of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations was consistently associated with the levels of household wealth, sense of control over one's life, physical activity and loneliness. Larger health inequalities were observed when health was measured as complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations than basic multimorbidity. Compared to the population group with the highest wealth, those with the lowest wealth had 47% higher odds of basic multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.34-1.61), 73% higher odds of complex multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.52-1.96) and 90% higher odds of having 10 or more functional limitations (95% C.I. 1.59-2.26). We did not find a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption, smoking and multimorbidity but rather evidence of people in ill health actively moderating their health behaviour. We suggest that materialist models of multimorbidity and functional limitation at older age can not, on their own, explain the health inequalities as the behavioural and psycho-social factors play an important role. Policies aiming to reduce the risk of multimorbidity and functional limitation should address the issue at these three levels simultaneously, using the existing national infrastructure of General Practices.",

Co-occurring chronic diseases are associated with functional limitations, particularly for the aging population ≥50 years old. Aging offenders (individual who are imprisoned) tend to have greater prevalence of chronic, mental health, and substance use disorders compared to non-imprisoned populations. Our primary aim was to determine patterns of co-occurring conditions associated with functional limitations among aging offenders.
Materials and methods
We included all male offenders from one correctional system who were ≥50 years old (n = 2270) and extracted diagnoses for chronic diseases, mental health, substance use disorders, and functional limitations from an electronic health record. We performed a principal factor analysis (PFA) to identify patterns and chi-square to determine if the multimorbid population (≥3 diagnoses) differed from peer groups in regard to functional limitations.
Results
Three patterns (chronic diseases, geriatric conditions, and mental health/substance use) emerged from PFA. Functional limitations were associated with the chronic disease pattern (p = .03) where the multimorbid group compared to non-multimorbid peers had 1.5 odds, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1], for having a physical impairment. The geriatric (p = .10) and mental health/substance use disorders (p = .07) patterns were not associated with having a functional limitation compared to the population without multiple diagnoses. Controlling for multimorbidity, functional limitations, and overlapping patterns, increasing age was the only significant factor (p = .02) associated with having a physical impairment.
Conclusion
The chronic disease pattern was consistent with investigations that included non-imprisoned populations. However, the geriatric pattern was not significant, which was unexpected.",

ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

abstract = "Like many other critical infrastructures, the public health systems of most countries have grown to high complexity and broad interdependence. Complex adaptive systems of this kind have been shown to evolve into a precarious state between order and disorder in which remote triggers can lead to cascading failure. The healthcare stresses of ageing populations, emerging infectious diseases and treatment-resistant pathogens continue to grow. However, the economic drive for leaner systems and supply chains, and their increasing interdependencies (power, water, food, fuel etc.), all contribute to the growing fragility of public health. When systems are stressed (during emergencies or disasters), accountability for effective resource use requires that health decision making switch from optimal care of individuals to a resource-conserving mode designed to maximise outcomes for the population. Understanding when and how to operate under such conditions, demands that decision makers have a strong grasp of system capacities, limitations and the beneficial or deleterious effects of parameters they are able to manipulate. These difficulties lie behind a growing effort to model health systems to inform planning and (more aspirationally) support real-time decision making. However, modelling efforts to date have been less than optimally founded and structured. Our purpose in this paper is to reframe conceptual approaches to the strategic modelling of health systems and their dependencies in order to point the way to a more productive path for health sector decision-support modelling.",

abstract = "Objective
In aging populations, a growing number of individuals are affected by cancer. However, the relevance of the disease for mental health is still controversial, especially after treatment. We drew from a representative community sample to explore the link of cancer with mental health assessing different dimensions and different periods of time.
Methods
A cohort of 14,375 men and women (35–74 years) underwent medical assessments and was queried about cancer history, previous diagnoses of mental disorders, current mental distress symptoms, and current subjective health appraisal.
Results
1066 participants (7.4%) reported a diagnosis of cancer (survival time M = 9.79 (SD = 9.07) years). Most common were breast (24.3%), skin (20.9%), gynecological (13.8%), and prostate cancer (12.9%). Based on cut-off-scores of standardized self-report scales (PHQ-9, GAD-2), rates of depression (8.4%; 95%CI 6.90–10.30) and anxiety symptoms (7.8%; 95%CI 6.30–9.60) corresponded to those of participants without cancer. In men, cancer was related to a lifetime diagnosis of depression (OR = 2.15; 95%CI 1.25–3.64). At the time of assessment, cancer was associated with reduced subjective health in both sexes and with anxiety symptoms in men (OR = 2.43; 95%CI 1.13–4.98).
Conclusion
Findings indicate different relations of cancer in men and in women with different operationalizations of mental health. They underscore that a history of cancer is not universally linked to distress in the general population. The study points out that different ascertainments of the association of cancer and mental health might be traced back to different assessment strategies. It also notes potential targets for interventions to alleviate distress, e.g. by physical activity.",

abstract = "Objectives
To track the trends in general health indicators and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), high blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol in the middle-aged urban population in the Czech Republic in 1998–2010.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
The following data from the three-phase HELEN (HEalth – Lifestyle – ENvironment) study, a prevalence questionnaire survey, were analysed: data collected from 8214 subjects in phase I, 6107 subjects in phase II, and 4389 subjects in phase III. The study subjects were aged 45–54 years and the study period spanned from 1998 to 2010. The differences in the indicators between phases were evaluated by binary and ordinal logistic regression models at a significance level of 0.01.
Results
Over the study period, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of respondents who self-rated their health as very good or good: from 46.6% to 51.0% in males (P = 0.006) and from 45.5% to 49.9% in females (P < 0.001). At the same time, the rates of respondents under long-term medical follow-up rose significantly from 36.3% to 44.3% (P < 0.001) and from 46.4% to 56.2% (P < 0.001), respectively. CVD prevalence did not change although the percentage of males and females with high blood pressure (from 29.3% to 36.6% and from 26.0% to 31.2%, respectively) and elevated total cholesterol (from 29.0% to 36.6% and from 27.3% to 32.4%, respectively) increased significantly.
Conclusions
Self-rated health among the middle-aged population in the Czech Republic improved during the 1998–2010 period, but, at the same time, more people needed to be followed up for a disease. The proportions of respondents with hypertension and elevated blood cholesterol increased while the CVD rates did not vary significantly.",

Energy efficiency improvements of homes may benefit health and access to affordable energy, yet better knowledge about contextual mechanisms and household practices is needed for the development of effective programs. This paper presents a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled retrofit trial targeting low-income older householders. Socio-technical systems thinking offered a useful approach to explore the construct of the engineering-dominated concept of residential energy efficiency in combination with the people-focused experience of housing and health. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain health, energy cost, temperature and psycho-social outcomes for winter. The findings showed that small retrofits may mitigate the growing energy demands of this ageing population group, provide better comfort and reduce energy costs, but that the effectiveness of the retrofits was reduced by socially shared heating and ventilation practices that contradicted engineering assumptions, the physiological capabilities of the householder and the modes of energy bill payments. A program that is framed around caring and safety and combines retrofits, tariff optimisations and householder practices could provide equitable climate change mitigation outcomes and co-benefits for health for this population group. The paper concludes with implications for the integration of equity and health as goals into low carbon transitions.",

This study describes the prevalence of anemia, hypertension and diabetes and the overall health status in pre-elderly and elderly subjects enrolled in two primary health care clinics, Eldorado and Piraporinha, in the city of Diadema, São Paulo.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 373 participants. Clinical data were collected from patient charts and the degree of disability and common mental disorders, as well as demographic data were obtained by interviews.
Results
The prevalence of anemia was approximately 11% and hypertension was 70% and 81% in Eldorado and Piraporinha, respectively. The frequency of diabetes was 52% in Eldorado and 30% in Piraporinha. The subjects of both health care clinics reported having difficulties in some of their daily physical and instrumental activities, with physical symptoms and emotional disorders.

The purpose of this research work is to explore the patients’ perceptions and experiences of self-management of diabetes in the rural area of Pakistan and to better understand differences in diabetes self-management among men and women living with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as the barriers and challenges of self-management of diabetes.
Methods
30 participants were recruited from a medical centre at Al-Rehman hospital at Abbottabad, Pakistan. Qualitative method was used to conduct interviews of n=30 patients with Type 2 diabetes using a semi-structured interview approach with audio recording to explore their perceptions and experiences of the self-management of type 2 diabetes and the factors that influence the management of diabetes.
Results
The qualitative analyses revealed six themes: stigma attached to the disease; self-management in context; patient-doctor relationship; adherence to diet and exercise; access to diabetes resources; and social support. Women were more adaptable to diabetic conditions, disclosed their diabetes more readily and are a lot more ready to integrate management into their daily lives, whereas men were more reluctant to tell friends and family about their diabetes due to the stigma attached to the disease and were less observant of self-management practices in social settings. Women used socially interactive resources such as internet access and education classes whereas men relied more on self-directed learning and wanted the guidance of health professionals. Finally, both men and women reported lack of support from the health care practitioners and families in managing their diabetes.
Conclusions
The results of this qualitative research highlighted the challenges of diabetes self-management among men and women in the rural area of Pakistan and barriers to self-management. These findings may help to inform gender-sensitive diabetes self-management approach, diabetes awareness in the population, counselling and support.",

The French healthcare insurance databases have proven to be valuable tools for the conduct of pharmaco-epidemiological studies with regards to the size of the population covered and that of the available information. Their wider use in the field of pediatric pharmacoepidemiology is of paramount importance given the existing gap of knowledge in the use and effects of many drugs in children and adolescents as well as the difficulties to conduct clinical research studies in this age population. However, because of the architectural complexity of these databases and their specificities, specific expertise should be developed in order to ensure the reliability of studies based on these data. To this purpose, it is important to facilitate knowledge sharing through national collaborative projects.",

This Series paper describes the current state of cancer control in Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs). PICTs are diverse but face common challenges of having small, geographically dispersed, isolated populations, with restricted resources, fragile ecological and economic systems, and overburdened health services. PICTs face a triple burden of infection-related cancers, rapid transition to lifestyle-related diseases, and ageing populations; additionally, PICTs are increasingly having to respond to natural disasters associated with climate change. In the Pacific region, cancer surveillance systems are generally weaker than those in high-income countries, and patients often present at advanced cancer stage. Many PICTs are unable to provide comprehensive cancer services, with some patients receiving cancer care in other countries where resources allow. Many PICTs do not have, or have poorly developed, cancer screening, pathology, oncology, surgical, and palliative care services, although some examples of innovative cancer planning, prevention, and treatment approaches have been developed in the region. To improve cancer outcomes, we recommend prioritising regional collaborative approaches, enhancing cervical cancer prevention, improving cancer surveillance and palliative care services, and developing targeted treatment capacity in the region.",

The ageing population will create in the medium term a new dynamic of recruitment in various sectors, including health. With increased life expectancy, the care of chronically ill has become an important area in the context of health services, since they need to be increasingly more focused on the need to provide palliative rather than curative care. Rationalization of resources must be a goal so that waste is minimized. The present model of palliative care ceases to respond to the pressing needs. What to do, to adapt to the changes brought by demographic change and by innovation? What models should be adopted for better resource optimization in palliative care? A literature review was carried out, including articles that compared the main differences between hospital and home care. Portugal has a multi-sectoral palliative care model, in light of what happens in reference countries, however, a better rationalization of resources will be required in order to ensure optimization in the distribution of patients. We also conclude that there is a gap between the patient's will and what is recommended. To respect the individual preferences of the patient, it is necessary to develop quality home-based palliative care services, focusing on training and the expansion of field teams.",

abstract = "Background
The human population is aging. A systematic summary of the epidemiology of skin diseases in the aged is lacking.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted including electronic database searches in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The eligibility criteria were primary incidence and prevalence studies or secondary data analysis, English or German language, subjects being 65+ years and reported skin problems or diseases. Data extraction was conducted using a standardized data collection form and the methodological quality of included studies was assessed.
Results
After screening of 1491 records, 74 records were included reporting data for more than 20 skin conditions. The majority of prevalence and incidence figures was identified for hospital and long-term care settings. The most prevalent skin diseases were fungal infections (14.3%–64%), dermatitis (1%–58.7%), xerosis (5.4%–85.5%) and benign skin tumors (1.7%–74.5%). Additionally, pressure ulcer prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 46% and incidence from 0.8% to 34%.
Conclusion
Skin conditions and diseases in aged populations are frequent. Health care practitioners should pay attention to those, although skin conditions might not be the primary reason for seeking care. Epidemiological data are lacking especially for home care and community settings although this can be regarded as the most important from a public health and prevention point of view. The methodological quality and reporting of epidemiological studies in the aged populations must be improved.

abstract = "Background and objectives
Detailed information about the current and future geographic distribution of Australia's frail population provides critical evidence to inform policy, resource allocation and planning initiatives that aim to treat and reverse frailty. Frailty is associated with poor health outcomes, including disability and death. It is also characterised by increased health care usage and costs. Understanding the distribution and growth of frailty is important for planning and budgeting service provision and health interventions aimed to support the needs of Australia's growing ageing population. The objective of this research is to provide baseline mapping and area level population estimates of Australia's current and future frail and pre-frail populations.
Research design and methods
Geospatial modelling was applied to national frailty prevalence rates to provide estimates of the size, distribution and potential growth of Australia's frail and pre-frail population.
Results
It is estimated that in 2016 approximately 415,769 people living in Australia aged 65 years or more are frail and almost 1.7 million people are pre-frail. In future years, as the population ages, these figures will increase rapidly, reaching 609,306 frail and 2,248,977 pre-frail by 2027, if prevalence continues at current levels. The geographic distribution of this projected growth is not uniform and while the largest frail populations will continue to be located in the major cities, the fastest growth will be in the outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas.
Discussion and implications
The projected growth of frail populations in outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas may be reduced by targeting health interventions in these areas and improving access to support services. Frailty is a dynamic condition that is amenable to intervention. Reducing frailty will lead to benefits in wellbeing for older Australians in addition to reductions in health care costs.",

However, the characteristics of green structures have been overlooked in previous studies, and the mediation effects of green structures on the suicide rate have not been analyzed. To evaluate the mediation impacts of green structures (patch area, fragmentation, and patch distance), this study explored the potential pathways and effects of green structures on the suicide rate using partial least squares modeling with data from Taiwan. Other factors influencing the suicide rate, such as economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were also considered in the model. The results revealed a negative association between the suicide rate and patch area (standardized total effect coefficient (STEC) = −0.42), but there were positive associations with fragmentation (STEC = 0.14), and patch distance (STEC = 0.35) of green structures. Therefore, maximizing the patch area, and minimizing fragmentation and patch distance can contribute to a reduction in the suicide rate. Fragmentation minimization was found to be crucial for both genders, while patch-area maximization and patch-distance minimization were only influential for females. Moreover, economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were influential for both genders. This is the first study to consider the direct and indirect pathways and effects of the green structure on suicide rate. Instead of considering only the area covered by green spaces, it was found that other characteristics of green structures should also be considered when formulating greening policies.",

Of ∼10.2 million people with chronic HCV infection in Europe, 6.7 million live in Eastern Europe, 2.3 million in Western Europe and 1.2 million in Central Europe. HCV transmission continues to occur in parallel with an increasing HCV-related liver disease burden, the result of an ageing population infected during peak HCV epidemics decades earlier. In 2016, the World Health Organization set targets to eliminate HCV infection as a major public health threat by 2030. Across Europe, an estimated 36% of those living with chronic HCV infection have been diagnosed and ∼5% have been treated. A major barrier to enhancing HCV treatment uptake has been restrictions set by payers, including national governments and others, in response to the initially high list prices of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. The aims of this article are to discuss DAA restrictions in Europe, why DAA restrictions are still in place, what has facilitated the removal of DAA restrictions, and what challenges remain as we attempt to eliminate HCV as a major public health threat in the region by 2030.",

At the global level, cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality rates are increasing. These trends are not fully explained by a growing and ageing population: with marked regional and socioeconomic disparities, lifestyle factors, the resources dedicated to preventive medicine, and the occupational and environmental control of hazardous chemicals all playing a role. While it is difficult to establish the contribution of chemical exposure to the societal burden of cancer, a number of measures can be taken to better assess the carcinogenic properties of chemicals and manage their risks. This paper discusses how these measures can be informed not only by the traditional data streams of regulatory toxicology, but also by using new toxicological assessment methods, along with indicators of public health status based on biomonitoring. These diverse evidence streams have the potential to form the basis of an integrated and more effective approach to cancer prevention.",

abstract = "Background
Empirical evidence suggests that multimorbidity and disability are each significantly associated with out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures; however few efforts have been made to explore their joint association with OOP health expenditures.
Objectives
To estimate the association of multimorbidity and disability with OOP health expenditures in households with older adults in Mexico, as well as the potential interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability on OOP health expenditures.
Methods
Longitudinal study based on data collected as part of the Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2009) and Wave 2 (2014), a nationally representative study in Mexico with a sample of older adults aged 50 and older. The dependent variable was OOP health expenditures, and main exposure variables were multimorbidity and disability. Two-Part regression models were used to analyze the relation between multimorbidity, disability and OOP health expenditures.
Results
Multimorbidity was associated with the probability of incurring OOP health expenditures (OR = 1.28, CI95% 1.11–1.48), and also the tertiles of disability (2nd tertile: OR = 1.45, CI95% 1.23–1.70; 3rd tertile: OR = 2.19, CI95% 1.81–2.66). The presence of multimorbidity was associated with an increase of 13% in average OOP health costs (β = 0.13, CI95% 0.01–0.25), and 16% for the 3rd tertile of disability (β = 0.16, CI95% 0.01–0.31). We did not find significant interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability.
Conclusions
Multimorbidity and disability appear to be important determinants of OOP health expenditures. The economic implications for the households and the health system should be highlighted, particularly in low- and middle-income countries because of the rapid growth of their aging populations.",

abstract = "Before 1990, Germany was divided for more than 40 years. While divided, significant mortality disparities between the populations of East and West Germany emerged. In the years following reunification, East German mortality improved considerably, eventually converging with West German levels. In this study, we explore changes in the gender differences in health at ages 20–59 across the eastern and western regions of Germany using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the 1990–2013 period. We apply random-effects linear regressions to the SOEP data to identify trends in health, measured as self-assessed health satisfaction, after German reunification. The findings indicate that women were substantially less satisfied with their health than men in both West and East Germany, but that the gender gap was larger in East Germany than in West Germany. Furthermore, the results show that respondents’ satisfaction with their health decreased over time, and that the decline was steeper among men – and particularly among East German men – than among women. Thus, the initial male advantage in health in East and West Germany in the years immediately after reunification diminished over time, and even reversed to become a female advantage in East Germany. One interpretation of this finding is that stress-inducing post-reunification changes in the political and social landscape of East Germany had lasting damaging consequences for men’s health. Ongoing risky health behaviors and high levels of economic insecurity due to unemployment could have had long-lasting effects on the health of the working-aged population. A partial explanation for our finding that health declined more sharply among East German men than among their female counterparts could be that women have better compensatory mechanisms than men for dealing with psychosocial stress.",

The data were retrieved from skeletal remains uncovered at 21 sites throughout the Middle Elbe-Saale region (MES), comprising a total of 494 individuals with preserved teeth. The data generated were examined for age- and sex-related differences in order to gain information about the dietary habits and socio-economic structures of the period with the goal of identifying potential diachronic changes. The results indicated that dietary habits changed over the course of the Neolithic period: the prevalence of caries significantly decreased between the Early and Late Neolithic. The adults from the Early Neolithic sample, particularly those from the LBK bore the highest rate of caries. This highlights the essential importance of cereals in the diet of the early farmers in the Middle Elbe-Saale region. As time went on, meat and dairy products became more and more important, which had a positive impact on dental health. The data also show sex-specific differences: women were more often affected by caries than men and female jaws also generally exhibited greater numbers of carious teeth than their male counterparts. Dental health is a reflection of both biological factors and of economic and sociocultural structures.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the hospitalization rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in a southern-european country and its associated charges over a period of 16 years.
Methods
We identified all discharges with a primary diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) between 2000 and 2015 in data provided by the Central Administration of Health Services (ACSS). National estimates of hospitalization rates were assessed and adjusted to gender, age, population, and hospitalizations. Hospitalization charges were also assessed.
Results
There were an estimated 31 358 and 16 669 discharges for CD and UC, respectively. From 2000 to 2015, hospitalization rates per 100000 habitants increased for CD (8.4–11.2) and remained stable for UC (4.4–4.9). The hospitalization rate for IBD increased slightly over time (12.8 per 100 000 habitants in 2000 and 16.1 in 2015). Annual total hospitalization charges amounted to 4.0M€ in 2000 and 5.7M€ in 2015. This increase was mainly due to a rise in the total expenses of CD-related hospitalizations.
Conclusion
CD hospitalization rates per 100000 inhabitants increased over time while remaining constant for UC. Hospitalization charges for IBD increased approximately 2.0M€ during the study period, representing an important burden in the national healthcare system.",

The relative percentage of older people is growing, while fewer young employees are entering the labour force. This phenomenon is directly connected with ageing of the workforce. Older workers constitute a special group with characteristics that require special attention from the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) point of view. The aim of this paper is to address what changes occur in ageing workers as a result of physical and psychological processes and the possible impacts of these at work in relation to OHS and the concept of sustainable work and workplaces. In addition, this paper discusses factors affecting work ability and worker’s performance in relation to the ageing phenomenon. Finally, based on the literature, the paper proposes measures to minimize age-related risks and increase awareness. These measures should be designed and adopted at the early stages of working life and continue until retirement. By reducing risk factors of employees, the rate of occupational accidents and occupational diseases may be decreased, thus saving costs for employers, health system and insurance costs, while simultaneously facilitating a healthier retirement for the working-age population.",

In the context of a rapidly ageing population, Singapore is anticipating a rise in multimorbidity, disability, and dependency, which are driven by physical frailty. Healthy Older People Everyday (HOPE) is an epidemiologic population-based study on community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older in Singapore.
Objective
To investigate the prevalence of frail and prefrail states and their association with polypharmacy, multimorbidity, cognitive and functional status, and perceived health status among community-dwelling older adults in Singapore.
Methods
Participants for HOPE were older adults aged 65 years and older recruited from a cohort study on the northwest region of Singapore. Analysis was performed on data collected from a combination of interviewer-administered questionnaires (including FRAIL scale, EQ-5D, Mini Mental State Examination, Barthel index, and Lawton IADL scale), clinical assessments, and physical measurements (including hand grip strength and Timed-Up-and-Go [TUG] test).
Results
A total of 1051 older adults (mean age 71.2 years) completed the study. More than half (57.2%) were female. The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty was 6.2% and 37%, respectively. Frailty was associated with older age, female gender, Indian (instead of Chinese) ethnicity, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment, weaker hand grip strength, longer TUG times, and poor perceived health status. Those with underlying cognitive impairment and frailty were at greater risk of adverse health outcome.
Conclusion
Frailty is a complex health state with multiple domains and dimensions. In our study in a multiethnic Asian population, we identified nonmodifiable factors and modifiable risk factors (multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment) that were associated with frailty. Interventions will have to be multipronged and will require a collaborated effort in order to effect change and improve the health span in rapidly ageing populations.",

The paper aims to explore effective measures and strategies for the promotion of ICT-enabled innovations for the elderly and people with special needs.
Methods
The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

The aim of this study is to strengthen the cross-national evidence base on the influence of regional employment levels and individual worklessness on health during the period of the Great Recession. We investigate whether higher regional employment levels are associated with better health over and above individual level employment. Individual level data (N = 23,078 aged 15–64 years) were taken from 16 countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) participating in the 2014 European Social Survey. Regional employment rates were extracted from Eurostat, corresponding with the start (2008) and end (2013) of the Great Recession. Health outcomes included self-reported heart or circulation problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, self-rated health, depression, obesity and allergies (as a falsification test). We calculated multilevel Poisson regression models, which included individuals nested within regions, controlling for potential confounding variables and country fixed effects. After adjustment for individual level socio-demographic factors, higher average regional employment rates (from 2008 to 2013) were associated with better health outcomes. Individual level worklessness was associated with worsened health outcomes, most strongly with poor self-rated health. In models including both individual worklessness and the average regional employment rate, regional employment remained associated with heart and circulation problems, depression and obesity. There was evidence of an interaction between individual worklessness and regional employment for poor self-rated health and depression. The findings suggest that across 16 European countries, for some key outcomes, higher levels of employment in the regional labour market may be beneficial for the health of the local population.",

abstract = "Background & Aims
Population growth and changes in demographic structure are linked to trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. The aim of this study is to estimate future CRC incidence in the ageing population, and compare trends across developing and developed regions.
Methods
Cancer and population data were extracted from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Annual incidence rates for the major types of cancer in 118 selected populations were extracted from 102 cancer registries in 39 countries worldwide. We selected 8 jurisdictions (from the United States, Europe, and Asia) that reported 20-year cancer incidence rates since 1988. Time series models were constructed to project cancer incidence, by sex and age, to 2030. Incidence rates for persons older than 65 years were combined and further adjusted for change of ageing population. We compared age-adjusted incidence rates among the jurisdictions.
Results
The total population older than 65 years old was 12,917,794 in 1988, and the number increased by almost 40% to 17,950,115 in 2007. In developed countries in the West CRC incidence is predicted to decrease by 16.3% in the United States, increase by 4.8% in the United Kingdom, and increase by 4.7% in Sweden by 2030. In developing countries, such as China (Shanghai), Croatia, and Costa Rica, CRC incidence is predicted to increase in a steep curve by 2030 because of the growing population and ageing effect; in 2030, the incidence increases were 60.5% for China, 47.0% for Croatia, and 18.5% for Costa Rica. We also predict CRC incidence will increase greatly by 2030 in Japan and Hong Kong, which are developed regions.
Conclusions
With the exception of the United States, the incidence of CRC is expected to continue to rise in most regions in the coming decades, due to population growth and changes in demographic structure. The predicted increases are more marked in developing regions with limited health care resources.",

abstract = "Background
Aging populations have led to increasing numbers of seniors presenting for emergency surgery. Older patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization, and increased institutionalization. We hypothesized that increased frailty would be a risk factor for increased health care costs in elderly surgical patients who have undergone emergency abdominal surgery.
Methods
A prospective cost analysis of emergency general surgery patients 65 years of age and older was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Preadmission Clinical Frailty Scale score and Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications were collected. Patients were followed for 6 months after discharge. Hospitalization costs were calculated using the Alberta Health Services (AHS) microcosting database; other costs were obtained from Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health databases. The primary outcome was total insured cost (2016 Can$). Multivariate generalized linear regression of log-transformed costs was conducted.
Results
Overall, 321 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 7.8), median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3, mean length of stay was 15.9 days (standard deviation 23.4), and 48% suffered a complication. Median total insured cost was Can$18,021 and median total cost was Can$26,739. Multivariate analysis found American Society of Anesthesiologists score (adjusted ratio [AR] = 1.24, P = .001), CFS (AR = 1.27, P < .001), major complications (AR = 2.11, P < .001), and minor complications (AR = 1.48, P < .001) lead to increased total insured costs.
Conclusion
Costs increased—after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and preadmission function as frailty—and American Society of Anesthesiologists score increased if minor or major complications occurred. The detection of frailty represents an opportunity to target risk-reduction strategies and interventions to improve outcomes and decrease cost.",

abstract = "Background
Few studies consider multiple pathways for explaining the gendered patterns of depression in Europe’s aged population, although ageing is often associated with an increased exposure to risk factors for depression, and the relevance of these risk factors is likely to differ between countries.
Methods
Based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we assess the relevance of gender inequalities in the exposure to psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors for explaining the gender gap in depression. Further, we investigate the association between depressive symptoms and these explanatory variables by gender and analyse whether their relevance differs between countries.
Results
Both the prevalence of depression by gender and the magnitude of the gender gap were low in Northern Europe and rather high in Southern Europe. Part of the gender gap was explained by psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors but significant gender differences remained. Health-related factors were of outstanding importance for explaining within-country variation in depressive symptoms for both women and men. With regard to psychosocial and socio-economic factors, the results were less clear.
Conclusion
The assessment of gender inequalities in depression and their determinants within different social policy contexts enables evidence-based interventions to reduce the gender gap and ensure high quality of life for older men and women. To that end, the reduction of health-related risk factors seems to be of utmost importance in all European countries, whereas interventions in the area of socio-economic and psychosocial risk factors should be gender- and context-specific.",

abstract = "Osteoporosis is a common bone disorder observed particularly in aging population and post-menopausal women. It results from an imbalance in the natural process of bone remodeling, a continuous cycle for bone formation and bone resorption. Though various drugs acting on different therapeutic targets of osteoporosis are available, focus is now shifting towards the natural alternatives to avoid side effects associated with the drug therapy. This review encompasses the spectrum of nutraceuticals such as minerals, herbs, phytochemicals and dairy products which can be included in the regime for osteoporotic patients to support bone health. Although scientific studies provide evidences of therapeutic efficacy of nutraceuticals, in-depth clinical investigation is need of the hour for its safe consumption by osteoporotic population. Furthermore, global regulatory requirements can be recommended for rational and safe use of nutraceuticals considering the tremendous growth of nutraceutical market in the near future.",

Although Israel is still young in years, with relatively high birth rates and older people (individuals aged 65 years or older) constituting only about 11% of its population, the absolute number of older people is growing rapidly. Life expectancy is high, and increasing numbers of people are living to advanced old age (older than 85 years). A wide spectrum of geriatric care is provided within a universal system providing health services to all citizens. Community and institutional care is available, and many innovative programmes are being developed. The unique demographic characteristics of the ageing society in Israel reflect cultural and multiethnic diversity, in addition to a high rate of immigration of older people. To meet the growing challenges, address disparities, and search for innovation will require planning and development of adequate services at the highest level.",

Given the aging population, it is predicted that admissions with heart failure will increase. Whilst pharmacological therapy has improved the associated morbidity and mortality, there is a need for additional therapies to improve the clinical outcome as the death rate remains high. Curcumin is a natural product derived from turmeric that appears to have cardiovascular benefit through a number of mechanisms. In this review, we have assessed the mechanisms by which curcumin may exert its effects in different models of heart failure and show that it has promise as a complementary treatment in heart failure.",

Moreover, the findings also revealed that age, income, income sufficiency, year of schooling and health condition had the positive influences on the opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement. Males had the higher opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement than females while married people had the higher opportunity than people with the other marital statuses. Private enterprise employees were found having the lower opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement than all other occupations and those who admitted that the economic preparation for retirement was necessary had the higher opportunity to have above average preparation than those who did not. In addition, those who lived as a head of household or a spouse of a head of household had the highest opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement. However, living with children under 18 years old lowered the opportunity to have above average economic preparation for retirement while indebtedness raised the opportunity to have it.",

These behaviors may put patients at risk for harm to self or others and lead to inefficient, ineffective, or inappropriate use of resources. This session aims to engage participants in considering varying definitions of patients with complex needs, and how VHA has worked to understand these needs, identify promising practices, and prepare a workforce capable of meeting these needs. In the first presentation, the presenter will discuss varying conceptualizations of “complex patients” and related challenges for targeted program development and dissemination. An overview of the development, activities, and plans for the VHA Care for Patients with Complex Problems Program will be presented. The audience will be engaged in discussing the challenges for providing geriatric behavioral care across inpatient mental health, nursing home, and rehabilitation care settings, and VHA efforts to develop guidance for teams wishing to enhance capacity to provide geriatric behavioral care in these settings will be shared. A unique program, the Behavioral Recovery Outreach (BRO) Team, that facilitates transitions of care for Veterans with complex behavioral needs from inpatient nursing care to community-based care settings will be described. A closing discussion with the audience will center around the next steps in policy and program development and evaluation needed to meet the needs of aging population with complex care needs.",

Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

Cloud computing along with the IoT concept is a novel trend, for an efficient management and online processing of sensor data, and its major problem is the protection of privacy. Normally, the data is acquired from the users (i.e. patients) by the healthcare service provider and distributes them with authorized clinics or healthcare experts and these details were distributed to both pharmaceutical and life health insurance companies. Additionally the hackers have susceptible about the data of the patient, at the time of synchronization or cloud transfer is happening with the devices that are interconnected. An efficient Elman Neural Network (ENN) classifier based data protection is given in this work, which forms the cryptography and authentication. This suggested work has two varieties of process namely client side and cloud side. In client side, initially, the EEG signal is obtained from human and is processed with the help of the Hyper analytic Wavelet Transform (HWT) with Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) method. Then, through the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) scheme, signal is safeguarded from forgery. The features were drawn-out from authenticated information in cloud side, and these details were divided as abnormal or not. The appropriateness of this work is validated by executing the technique called One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with IoT that drivens the ECG-dependent health monitoring system in the cloud on both experimental analysis and simulation.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

AAL technologies are used to prevent, cure and improve the wellness and health conditions of the elderly. However, their adoption and use by older adults is still a major challenge. User Experience (UX) evaluations aim at aiding on this task, by identifying the experience that a user has while interacting with an AAL technology under particular conditions. This may help designing better products and improve user engagement and adoption of AAL solutions. However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional UX evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results.",

This paper describes the development of ICT, which may drastically change solutions, with emphasis on the real-world nature. Next, three effective solutions for the era of falling birthrate and aging population are described. In addition, Nakashima's innovative approach for enabling, for the first time, the creation of a new social system by bringing IoT and FinTech into the world of Mobility is described. Finally, Mobility as a Service, which can be realized by integrating traffic modes with ICT, is discussed from the viewpoint of the systems innovation theory including the platform theory.

abstract = "With frequent severe haze and smog episodes in Chinese cities, an increasing number of studies have focused on estimating the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on public health. However, the current use of national and provincial demographic data might mask regional differences and lead to inaccurate estimations of pollution-related health impacts across cities. We applied the Global Burden of Disease methodology to develop a dataset of premature deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5 in 129 Chinese cities in 2006, 2010 and 2015, based on the information of baseline mortality rates and population densities at the city level. Our results suggested that ambient PM2.5 pollution led to 631,230 (95% confidence interval: 281,460–873,800) premature deaths in those cities in 2015, which was similar to that in 2010, but 42.8% higher than that in 2006. The reduction of premature deaths was not as obvious as the improvement in air quality in recent years, primarily owing to the aging Chinese population. For large and medium/small cities, the effects of PM2.5 abatement on alleviating public health burdens were lower than those for megalopolises and metropolises; however, such large and medium/small cities are at risk of increasing future PM2.5 pollution levels due to rapid development. Significant differences in PM2.5-induced premature deaths indicated the need for specific policies to mitigate the health burden of air pollution in different types of Chinese cities.",

abstract = "The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.",

abstract = "The increase in the prevalence of heart disease has become a serious public health issue. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are two main modifiable health risk factors for heart disease. In a fast ageing society, proper preventive measures should be adopted, particularly to achieve healthy aging. The objective of the present study is to examine the factors affecting the use of two health tests, namely blood cholesterol and blood pressure screenings among adults aged 60 years and above in Malaysia. Nationally representative data collected through the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 (NHMS, 2011) by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia were analysed. The survey used a two-stage stratified sampling method. Enumeration Blocks were selected in the first stage, while the second stage involved selection of Living Quarters. The proportions of those not using the blood cholesterol (45.4%) and blood pressure (30.8%) tests are alarmingly high. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the determinants of the use of these two health screening tests. The results show that education, ethnicity, location of residence, employment status, health insurance and smoking significantly affect the decision of the aged population to undergo these tests. Key findings are, first, time is a more dominant factor than income in determining health screening behaviour among the aged population. Second, being covered by insurance increases the propensity to undergo health screening. Third, smokers have a lower likelihood of screening than non-smokers. The findings suggest that intervention programmes should be targeted at the less-educated, employed individuals, individuals not covered by health insurance and smokers.",

The growingly diverse aging population presents a challenge for the geriatric workforce, particularly its capacity to effectively respond to the sociocultural and linguistic needs of ethnic minority older adults. Informed by research on the importance of culturally-competent care in reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, this study sought to understand the meaning of healthy aging from the perspectives of Korean American, Vietnamese American, and Latino older adults.
Methods
Interviews were conducted with 30 participants recruited from community-based organizations in Southern California.
Results
Several dimensions emerged in the participants' understanding of healthy aging: (1) having good physical and mental health (2) optimism and acceptance; (3) social connectedness; (4) taking charge of one's health; and (5) independence and self-worth.
Conclusions
Results could inform the development of a culturally-responsive geriatric healthcare system that takes into account older adults' beliefs, preferences, and needs to promote successful aging.",

Data from three nation-wide community-based surveys, which were conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2015 were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed for 2015 data to identify factors associated with healthcare utilisation.
Results
Analysis noted increasing trends in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity from 1996 to 2015. Decreasing trends were noted in the prevalence of current smokers and drinkers over this 20-year period, whereas health service utilisation increased with age in all surveys. In 2015, both inpatient and outpatient care are significantly associated with increasing age and diabetes.
Conclusions
Increasing trends of health problems and healthcare utilisation were observed among older people in Malaysia. Policymakers should plan for appropriate resources to meet the challenges of an ageing population in Malaysia.",

However, economic growth has not been accompanied by sufficient attention given to important public health issues, including an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases and a decline in physical activity (PA) that comes with an aging population. The rapid growth in China's older population will soon exert an impact on the nation's economy, population health status, and health behaviors, and will increase stress on its healthcare system. This review article provides a broad perspective on the impact of rapid economic development, industrialization, and urbanization on health-related behaviors, with a specific focus on PA among older adults. Specifically, the article offers an overview of the demographic context, significant public health challenges, evidence on PA and exercise interventions, and knowledge gaps and future directions for research.",

The quality of life in aging and the cost for the health care system require actions to promote healthy aging. In this regard, several risk factors associated with the development of neurodegeneration can be identified, and programs to educate people on the key role of prevention could significantly ameliorate the future picture of the aging population. Here we describe the key role of the pre- and postnatal period of life during the first 1000 days of life, focusing on the importance of nutrition and a healthy lifestyle of mother and offspring for the prevention of neurodegeneration later in life. Environmental risk factors (i.e., nutrition, stress, xenobiotics, alcohol, drugs, smoking, etc.) mediate the genetic and epigenetic signature of offspring which may have long-term effects on the onset of neurodegeneration.",

Despite its public health importance, there is a significant lack of knowledge about PA in older Chinese adults that may hamper primary prevention efforts of health promotion in an increasingly aging population. To fill this gap, this article presents a narrative review of PA in the older Chinese adult population with a special focus on residential settings (i.e., urban and rural). Using existing studies, the review examines overall PA patterns and their correlates and discusses public health implications and future research. Although there are some preliminary indications of urban and rural differences in PA in the aging population in China, continued research efforts are needed to facilitate primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing noncommunicable diseases and promoting an active lifestyle among the largest population of older people in the world.",

Our empirical findings demonstrate that health care expenditure and its determinants are non-stationary, and revealed the existence of a long run relationship among variables. Furthermore, the estimation results suggest that income is not the only driver of health expenditure in the Arab world countries in the long run. Other variables such as medical progress and ageing population are also playing an important role in the increase of health care expenditure with major policy implications for the region in the long run. Furthermore, the results support that health care expenditure is a necessity good for the three income groups. Finally, the Pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test shows evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between health care expenditures and income for the full sample, as well as for the groups income.",

Patient portals have the potential to increase patient engagement. Older patients are of particular interest as they are likely to suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Yet, questions remain about how patient portals are perceived and deemed useful by older adults. This study explored attitudes toward, perceived utility of, and requirements of a patient portal from the perspective of older adults.
Methods
We used a mixed-method approach integrating online surveys, a review of existing portals, and participatory design workshops with 17 people who were 65 years old and over.
Results
The findings demonstrate that the participants used a patient portal primarily as one of the communication channels to interact with their providers, rather than as a tool for accessing and managing personal health information. Consequently, the perception of whether or not a provider would use the patient portal was a primary factor that older adults considered in determining the adoption and use of a portal.
Conclusions
It is important to understand that older adults would perceive a patient portal as one part of a larger communication system to interact with a provider. This finding will help researchers and practitioners to advance the design and use of a patient portal to effectively incorporate it into older adults’ health care and better serve the unique needs of the ageing population.",

Since 2008, China has been rolling out an ambitious reform program, which aims to achieve affordable health insurance coverage for all Chinese citizens. Under this reform program, Chinese living in rural areas are eligible to enroll in a subsidized scheme called the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS). Using a three stage game model involving a government, a private fund manager and population, we explore the impact of population aging on NCMS. Our model highlights the role of government regulation and subsidy in ensuring operation efficiency of the system. We show that at optimality the government sets the operating framework for the fund manager to constrain the potential for monopoly profits. The Government subsidizes the scheme to prevent an adverse selection death spiral. However, the effectiveness of the subsidy in achieving this goal is moderated by the age structure of the population. Our model gives insights into the strengths of the NCMS framework and also can be used to support decisions about resource allocation and understand how scheme dynamics may unfold as the Chinese population ages further.",

This study is to longitudinally investigate the association between grip strength and mental health disorders in middle aged and aged population from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging.
Methods
Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) from 2006 to 2016 was assessed using longitudinal data analysis and out of the 9279 research subjects gathered 1549 (16.7%) participants were reported as Q1 group and 2074 (22.4%) participants were reported as Q5 group. To analyze the association between grip strength and mental health disorders, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used.
Results
The association between grip strength and cognitive decline was statistically significant, with the following Odds ratio (OR) predicting decreased cognitive decline: OR = 4.99 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. The association between grip strength and MMSE and CESD was also statistically significant, with the following estimate (B) predicting decreased MMSE score: B = −0.12 (p < .0001) for Q1 group vs. Q5 group. In terms of CESD, CESD score was higher for Q1 group (B = 0.34, p < .0001) compared to Q5 group.
Conclusion
This study shows a significant association between grip strength and risk of mental illness in Korean middle aged and aged population. Therefore, grip strength should be given more focus in terms of resistance training programs.",

abstract = "Background
The ageing population and growing burden of chronic disease has increased demands for primary health care services, necessitating growth of this nursing workforce. Studies have explored strategies in retaining nurses, employment conditions in primary health care, and transitioning of acute care nurses to primary health care employment. Few studies have explored how undergraduate nursing students perceive and are prepared to work in this sector.
Aim
This review synthesises evidence on the impact of undergraduate curriculum on nursing students’ attitudes, perceptions and preparedness to work in primary health care.
Design
An integrative literature review guided the synthesis of evidence.
Data sources
Scopus, ScienceDirect, CINAHL and MEDLINE were searched for relevant studies published between 2008 and 2018.
Review methods
491 studies were identified from the database searches. Following the removal of duplicates, review of abstracts and keywords against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 papers were subjected to full-text review. Twelve papers, including one thesis, met the inclusion criteria. Using an appraisal system, no paper was excluded based on methodological quality.
Results
Three themes were identified, namely: impact of curricula; knowledge and attitudes to primary health care; and students’ intention to work in primary health care. The preparation of undergraduate nursing students to work in this area is inconsistent as curricula remain acute-care focussed. Negative perceptions about the primary health care nursing role impact intentions of nursing students to work in primary health care.
Conclusion
This review highlights a need to implement strategies to improve the understanding of undergraduate nurses around the primary health care nursing role. In particular, providing students with skills, knowledge and an understanding of working in this area through curriculum content and structure may provide undergraduates with the desire and confidence to seek employment in primary health care following graduation.",

abstract = "This study explores longitudinal relationships between material, psycho-social and behavioural social determinants of health and multimorbidity of people aged 50 years or older in England. We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected biannually between 2002 and 2015. Apart from the basic measure of multimorbidity (two or more diseases within a person) we constructed two distinct measures of health in order to take into account the biology of ageing (complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations). We found that the likelihood of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations was consistently associated with the levels of household wealth, sense of control over one's life, physical activity and loneliness. Larger health inequalities were observed when health was measured as complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations than basic multimorbidity. Compared to the population group with the highest wealth, those with the lowest wealth had 47% higher odds of basic multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.34-1.61), 73% higher odds of complex multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.52-1.96) and 90% higher odds of having 10 or more functional limitations (95% C.I. 1.59-2.26). We did not find a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption, smoking and multimorbidity but rather evidence of people in ill health actively moderating their health behaviour. We suggest that materialist models of multimorbidity and functional limitation at older age can not, on their own, explain the health inequalities as the behavioural and psycho-social factors play an important role. Policies aiming to reduce the risk of multimorbidity and functional limitation should address the issue at these three levels simultaneously, using the existing national infrastructure of General Practices.",

abstract = "Objectives
Co-occurring chronic diseases are associated with functional limitations, particularly for the aging population ≥50 years old. Aging offenders (individual who are imprisoned) tend to have greater prevalence of chronic, mental health, and substance use disorders compared to non-imprisoned populations. Our primary aim was to determine patterns of co-occurring conditions associated with functional limitations among aging offenders.
Materials and methods
We included all male offenders from one correctional system who were ≥50 years old (n = 2270) and extracted diagnoses for chronic diseases, mental health, substance use disorders, and functional limitations from an electronic health record. We performed a principal factor analysis (PFA) to identify patterns and chi-square to determine if the multimorbid population (≥3 diagnoses) differed from peer groups in regard to functional limitations.
Results
Three patterns (chronic diseases, geriatric conditions, and mental health/substance use) emerged from PFA. Functional limitations were associated with the chronic disease pattern (p = .03) where the multimorbid group compared to non-multimorbid peers had 1.5 odds, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1], for having a physical impairment. The geriatric (p = .10) and mental health/substance use disorders (p = .07) patterns were not associated with having a functional limitation compared to the population without multiple diagnoses. Controlling for multimorbidity, functional limitations, and overlapping patterns, increasing age was the only significant factor (p = .02) associated with having a physical impairment.
Conclusion
The chronic disease pattern was consistent with investigations that included non-imprisoned populations. However, the geriatric pattern was not significant, which was unexpected.",

ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

Driving, being driven by a spouse/partner and taking public transport were independently associated with better indicators of social participation and psychosocial wellbeing versus relying on lifts from family/friends. Non-drivers and less frequent drivers had poorer outcomes versus current drivers. These results highlight the importance of being able to travel independently whether by car or public transport.

Complex adaptive systems of this kind have been shown to evolve into a precarious state between order and disorder in which remote triggers can lead to cascading failure. The healthcare stresses of ageing populations, emerging infectious diseases and treatment-resistant pathogens continue to grow. However, the economic drive for leaner systems and supply chains, and their increasing interdependencies (power, water, food, fuel etc.), all contribute to the growing fragility of public health. When systems are stressed (during emergencies or disasters), accountability for effective resource use requires that health decision making switch from optimal care of individuals to a resource-conserving mode designed to maximise outcomes for the population. Understanding when and how to operate under such conditions, demands that decision makers have a strong grasp of system capacities, limitations and the beneficial or deleterious effects of parameters they are able to manipulate. These difficulties lie behind a growing effort to model health systems to inform planning and (more aspirationally) support real-time decision making. However, modelling efforts to date have been less than optimally founded and structured. Our purpose in this paper is to reframe conceptual approaches to the strategic modelling of health systems and their dependencies in order to point the way to a more productive path for health sector decision-support modelling.",

abstract = "Objective
In aging populations, a growing number of individuals are affected by cancer. However, the relevance of the disease for mental health is still controversial, especially after treatment. We drew from a representative community sample to explore the link of cancer with mental health assessing different dimensions and different periods of time.
Methods
A cohort of 14,375 men and women (35–74 years) underwent medical assessments and was queried about cancer history, previous diagnoses of mental disorders, current mental distress symptoms, and current subjective health appraisal.
Results
1066 participants (7.4%) reported a diagnosis of cancer (survival time M = 9.79 (SD = 9.07) years). Most common were breast (24.3%), skin (20.9%), gynecological (13.8%), and prostate cancer (12.9%). Based on cut-off-scores of standardized self-report scales (PHQ-9, GAD-2), rates of depression (8.4%; 95%CI 6.90–10.30) and anxiety symptoms (7.8%; 95%CI 6.30–9.60) corresponded to those of participants without cancer. In men, cancer was related to a lifetime diagnosis of depression (OR = 2.15; 95%CI 1.25–3.64). At the time of assessment, cancer was associated with reduced subjective health in both sexes and with anxiety symptoms in men (OR = 2.43; 95%CI 1.13–4.98).
Conclusion
Findings indicate different relations of cancer in men and in women with different operationalizations of mental health. They underscore that a history of cancer is not universally linked to distress in the general population. The study points out that different ascertainments of the association of cancer and mental health might be traced back to different assessment strategies. It also notes potential targets for interventions to alleviate distress, e.g. by physical activity.",

To track the trends in general health indicators and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), high blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol in the middle-aged urban population in the Czech Republic in 1998–2010.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
The following data from the three-phase HELEN (HEalth – Lifestyle – ENvironment) study, a prevalence questionnaire survey, were analysed: data collected from 8214 subjects in phase I, 6107 subjects in phase II, and 4389 subjects in phase III. The study subjects were aged 45–54 years and the study period spanned from 1998 to 2010. The differences in the indicators between phases were evaluated by binary and ordinal logistic regression models at a significance level of 0.01.
Results
Over the study period, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of respondents who self-rated their health as very good or good: from 46.6% to 51.0% in males (P = 0.006) and from 45.5% to 49.9% in females (P < 0.001). At the same time, the rates of respondents under long-term medical follow-up rose significantly from 36.3% to 44.3% (P < 0.001) and from 46.4% to 56.2% (P < 0.001), respectively. CVD prevalence did not change although the percentage of males and females with high blood pressure (from 29.3% to 36.6% and from 26.0% to 31.2%, respectively) and elevated total cholesterol (from 29.0% to 36.6% and from 27.3% to 32.4%, respectively) increased significantly.
Conclusions
Self-rated health among the middle-aged population in the Czech Republic improved during the 1998–2010 period, but, at the same time, more people needed to be followed up for a disease. The proportions of respondents with hypertension and elevated blood cholesterol increased while the CVD rates did not vary significantly.",

The participants in this cross-sectional study included 203 older Korean adults aged 65 and over. Findings of this study suggest that self-compassion in older adults protects them from developing mental health and sleep disturbance symptoms while enhancing their life satisfaction, self-care, and usual activities. Therefore, interventions fostering self-compassion may benefit older adults’ mental health and quality of life.",

Energy efficiency improvements of homes may benefit health and access to affordable energy, yet better knowledge about contextual mechanisms and household practices is needed for the development of effective programs. This paper presents a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled retrofit trial targeting low-income older householders. Socio-technical systems thinking offered a useful approach to explore the construct of the engineering-dominated concept of residential energy efficiency in combination with the people-focused experience of housing and health. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain health, energy cost, temperature and psycho-social outcomes for winter. The findings showed that small retrofits may mitigate the growing energy demands of this ageing population group, provide better comfort and reduce energy costs, but that the effectiveness of the retrofits was reduced by socially shared heating and ventilation practices that contradicted engineering assumptions, the physiological capabilities of the householder and the modes of energy bill payments. A program that is framed around caring and safety and combines retrofits, tariff optimisations and householder practices could provide equitable climate change mitigation outcomes and co-benefits for health for this population group. The paper concludes with implications for the integration of equity and health as goals into low carbon transitions.",

The RHS was described as an opportunity to holistically care for a person across the care continuum, address social determinants of health, develop new models of care, and work with social and community partners. Challenges to RHS implementation included difficulties aligning the goals, values, and priorities of multiple actors, the need for better integration across clusters, differing care capabilities and capacities across partners, healthcare financing structures that may not reflect RHS goals, scalability and evaluation of pilot programmes, and disease-centricity, provider-centricity, and medicalisation in health and healthcare. Suggested ways forward included building relationships between actors to facilitate integration; exploring innovative new models of care; clear long-term/scale-up plans for successful pilots; healthcare financing reforms to meet changing patient and population needs; and developing evaluation systems reflective of RHS principles and priorities.",

The rapid increase in the aged population has resulted in a growing number of cases of chronic diseases. This increase is an important demographic change that low- and middle-income countries have to face and poses a new challenge to health services. One of the first steps to formulate public policies is to understand the reality of each country's aging population. This study describes the prevalence of anemia, hypertension and diabetes and the overall health status in pre-elderly and elderly subjects enrolled in two primary health care clinics, Eldorado and Piraporinha, in the city of Diadema, São Paulo.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 373 participants. Clinical data were collected from patient charts and the degree of disability and common mental disorders, as well as demographic data were obtained by interviews.
Results
The prevalence of anemia was approximately 11% and hypertension was 70% and 81% in Eldorado and Piraporinha, respectively. The frequency of diabetes was 52% in Eldorado and 30% in Piraporinha. The subjects of both health care clinics reported having difficulties in some of their daily physical and instrumental activities, with physical symptoms and emotional disorders.
Conclusion
Anemia, hypertension and diabetes are prevalent in the studied population, and patients showed degrees of dependency and impaired health status.",

The purpose of this research work is to explore the patients’ perceptions and experiences of self-management of diabetes in the rural area of Pakistan and to better understand differences in diabetes self-management among men and women living with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as the barriers and challenges of self-management of diabetes.
Methods
30 participants were recruited from a medical centre at Al-Rehman hospital at Abbottabad, Pakistan. Qualitative method was used to conduct interviews of n=30 patients with Type 2 diabetes using a semi-structured interview approach with audio recording to explore their perceptions and experiences of the self-management of type 2 diabetes and the factors that influence the management of diabetes.
Results
The qualitative analyses revealed six themes: stigma attached to the disease; self-management in context; patient-doctor relationship; adherence to diet and exercise; access to diabetes resources; and social support. Women were more adaptable to diabetic conditions, disclosed their diabetes more readily and are a lot more ready to integrate management into their daily lives, whereas men were more reluctant to tell friends and family about their diabetes due to the stigma attached to the disease and were less observant of self-management practices in social settings. Women used socially interactive resources such as internet access and education classes whereas men relied more on self-directed learning and wanted the guidance of health professionals. Finally, both men and women reported lack of support from the health care practitioners and families in managing their diabetes.
Conclusions
The results of this qualitative research highlighted the challenges of diabetes self-management among men and women in the rural area of Pakistan and barriers to self-management. These findings may help to inform gender-sensitive diabetes self-management approach, diabetes awareness in the population, counselling and support.",

This Series paper describes the current state of cancer control in Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs). PICTs are diverse but face common challenges of having small, geographically dispersed, isolated populations, with restricted resources, fragile ecological and economic systems, and overburdened health services. PICTs face a triple burden of infection-related cancers, rapid transition to lifestyle-related diseases, and ageing populations; additionally, PICTs are increasingly having to respond to natural disasters associated with climate change. In the Pacific region, cancer surveillance systems are generally weaker than those in high-income countries, and patients often present at advanced cancer stage. Many PICTs are unable to provide comprehensive cancer services, with some patients receiving cancer care in other countries where resources allow. Many PICTs do not have, or have poorly developed, cancer screening, pathology, oncology, surgical, and palliative care services, although some examples of innovative cancer planning, prevention, and treatment approaches have been developed in the region. To improve cancer outcomes, we recommend prioritising regional collaborative approaches, enhancing cervical cancer prevention, improving cancer surveillance and palliative care services, and developing targeted treatment capacity in the region.",

The ageing population will create in the medium term a new dynamic of recruitment in various sectors, including health. With increased life expectancy, the care of chronically ill has become an important area in the context of health services, since they need to be increasingly more focused on the need to provide palliative rather than curative care. Rationalization of resources must be a goal so that waste is minimized. The present model of palliative care ceases to respond to the pressing needs. What to do, to adapt to the changes brought by demographic change and by innovation? What models should be adopted for better resource optimization in palliative care? A literature review was carried out, including articles that compared the main differences between hospital and home care. Portugal has a multi-sectoral palliative care model, in light of what happens in reference countries, however, a better rationalization of resources will be required in order to ensure optimization in the distribution of patients. We also conclude that there is a gap between the patient's will and what is recommended. To respect the individual preferences of the patient, it is necessary to develop quality home-based palliative care services, focusing on training and the expansion of field teams.",

abstract = "Background
The human population is aging. A systematic summary of the epidemiology of skin diseases in the aged is lacking.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted including electronic database searches in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The eligibility criteria were primary incidence and prevalence studies or secondary data analysis, English or German language, subjects being 65+ years and reported skin problems or diseases. Data extraction was conducted using a standardized data collection form and the methodological quality of included studies was assessed.
Results
After screening of 1491 records, 74 records were included reporting data for more than 20 skin conditions. The majority of prevalence and incidence figures was identified for hospital and long-term care settings. The most prevalent skin diseases were fungal infections (14.3%–64%), dermatitis (1%–58.7%), xerosis (5.4%–85.5%) and benign skin tumors (1.7%–74.5%). Additionally, pressure ulcer prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 46% and incidence from 0.8% to 34%.
Conclusion
Skin conditions and diseases in aged populations are frequent. Health care practitioners should pay attention to those, although skin conditions might not be the primary reason for seeking care. Epidemiological data are lacking especially for home care and community settings although this can be regarded as the most important from a public health and prevention point of view. The methodological quality and reporting of epidemiological studies in the aged populations must be improved.

Detailed information about the current and future geographic distribution of Australia's frail population provides critical evidence to inform policy, resource allocation and planning initiatives that aim to treat and reverse frailty.

Understanding the distribution and growth of frailty is important for planning and budgeting service provision and health interventions aimed to support the needs of Australia's growing ageing population. The objective of this research is to provide baseline mapping and area level population estimates of Australia's current and future frail and pre-frail populations.
Research design and methods
Geospatial modelling was applied to national frailty prevalence rates to provide estimates of the size, distribution and potential growth of Australia's frail and pre-frail population.
Results
It is estimated that in 2016 approximately 415,769 people living in Australia aged 65 years or more are frail and almost 1.7 million people are pre-frail. In future years, as the population ages, these figures will increase rapidly, reaching 609,306 frail and 2,248,977 pre-frail by 2027, if prevalence continues at current levels. The geographic distribution of this projected growth is not uniform and while the largest frail populations will continue to be located in the major cities, the fastest growth will be in the outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas.
Discussion and implications
The projected growth of frail populations in outer metropolitan, regional and remote areas may be reduced by targeting health interventions in these areas and improving access to support services. Frailty is a dynamic condition that is amenable to intervention. Reducing frailty will lead to benefits in wellbeing for older Australians in addition to reductions in health care costs.",

Maximization of well-being and quality of life of older adults can occur if determinants of health are addressed and preventive behaviors are supported. Primary care-based preventive visits such as the Medicare annual wellness visit can be used with older adults to enhance health promotion efforts. A scoping review of studies was conducted to identify current evidence concerning the impact of this visit on preventive practices, risk reduction and lifestyle behavior changes for community-dwelling older adults. A total of 11 studies were included in this review. Preventive services use outcomes including vaccinations and screenings were most frequently reported.

However, the characteristics of green structures have been overlooked in previous studies, and the mediation effects of green structures on the suicide rate have not been analyzed. To evaluate the mediation impacts of green structures (patch area, fragmentation, and patch distance), this study explored the potential pathways and effects of green structures on the suicide rate using partial least squares modeling with data from Taiwan. Other factors influencing the suicide rate, such as economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were also considered in the model. The results revealed a negative association between the suicide rate and patch area (standardized total effect coefficient (STEC) = −0.42), but there were positive associations with fragmentation (STEC = 0.14), and patch distance (STEC = 0.35) of green structures. Therefore, maximizing the patch area, and minimizing fragmentation and patch distance can contribute to a reduction in the suicide rate. Fragmentation minimization was found to be crucial for both genders, while patch-area maximization and patch-distance minimization were only influential for females. Moreover, economic status, an aging population, population density, and temperature were influential for both genders. This is the first study to consider the direct and indirect pathways and effects of the green structure on suicide rate. Instead of considering only the area covered by green spaces, it was found that other characteristics of green structures should also be considered when formulating greening policies.",

Of ∼10.2 million people with chronic HCV infection in Europe, 6.7 million live in Eastern Europe, 2.3 million in Western Europe and 1.2 million in Central Europe. HCV transmission continues to occur in parallel with an increasing HCV-related liver disease burden, the result of an ageing population infected during peak HCV epidemics decades earlier. In 2016, the World Health Organization set targets to eliminate HCV infection as a major public health threat by 2030. Across Europe, an estimated 36% of those living with chronic HCV infection have been diagnosed and ∼5% have been treated. A major barrier to enhancing HCV treatment uptake has been restrictions set by payers, including national governments and others, in response to the initially high list prices of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. The aims of this article are to discuss DAA restrictions in Europe, why DAA restrictions are still in place, what has facilitated the removal of DAA restrictions, and what challenges remain as we attempt to eliminate HCV as a major public health threat in the region by 2030.",

At the global level, cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality rates are increasing.

While it is difficult to establish the contribution of chemical exposure to the societal burden of cancer, a number of measures can be taken to better assess the carcinogenic properties of chemicals and manage their risks. This paper discusses how these measures can be informed not only by the traditional data streams of regulatory toxicology, but also by using new toxicological assessment methods, along with indicators of public health status based on biomonitoring. These diverse evidence streams have the potential to form the basis of an integrated and more effective approach to cancer prevention.",

abstract = "Background
Empirical evidence suggests that multimorbidity and disability are each significantly associated with out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures; however few efforts have been made to explore their joint association with OOP health expenditures.
Objectives
To estimate the association of multimorbidity and disability with OOP health expenditures in households with older adults in Mexico, as well as the potential interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability on OOP health expenditures.
Methods
Longitudinal study based on data collected as part of the Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2009) and Wave 2 (2014), a nationally representative study in Mexico with a sample of older adults aged 50 and older. The dependent variable was OOP health expenditures, and main exposure variables were multimorbidity and disability. Two-Part regression models were used to analyze the relation between multimorbidity, disability and OOP health expenditures.
Results
Multimorbidity was associated with the probability of incurring OOP health expenditures (OR = 1.28, CI95% 1.11–1.48), and also the tertiles of disability (2nd tertile: OR = 1.45, CI95% 1.23–1.70; 3rd tertile: OR = 2.19, CI95% 1.81–2.66). The presence of multimorbidity was associated with an increase of 13% in average OOP health costs (β = 0.13, CI95% 0.01–0.25), and 16% for the 3rd tertile of disability (β = 0.16, CI95% 0.01–0.31). We did not find significant interaction effects of multimorbidity and disability.
Conclusions
Multimorbidity and disability appear to be important determinants of OOP health expenditures. The economic implications for the households and the health system should be highlighted, particularly in low- and middle-income countries because of the rapid growth of their aging populations.",

abstract = "Before 1990, Germany was divided for more than 40 years. While divided, significant mortality disparities between the populations of East and West Germany emerged. In the years following reunification, East German mortality improved considerably, eventually converging with West German levels. In this study, we explore changes in the gender differences in health at ages 20–59 across the eastern and western regions of Germany using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the 1990–2013 period. We apply random-effects linear regressions to the SOEP data to identify trends in health, measured as self-assessed health satisfaction, after German reunification. The findings indicate that women were substantially less satisfied with their health than men in both West and East Germany, but that the gender gap was larger in East Germany than in West Germany. Furthermore, the results show that respondents’ satisfaction with their health decreased over time, and that the decline was steeper among men – and particularly among East German men – than among women. Thus, the initial male advantage in health in East and West Germany in the years immediately after reunification diminished over time, and even reversed to become a female advantage in East Germany. One interpretation of this finding is that stress-inducing post-reunification changes in the political and social landscape of East Germany had lasting damaging consequences for men’s health. Ongoing risky health behaviors and high levels of economic insecurity due to unemployment could have had long-lasting effects on the health of the working-aged population. A partial explanation for our finding that health declined more sharply among East German men than among their female counterparts could be that women have better compensatory mechanisms than men for dealing with psychosocial stress.",

The data generated were examined for age- and sex-related differences in order to gain information about the dietary habits and socio-economic structures of the period with the goal of identifying potential diachronic changes. The results indicated that dietary habits changed over the course of the Neolithic period: the prevalence of caries significantly decreased between the Early and Late Neolithic. The adults from the Early Neolithic sample, particularly those from the LBK bore the highest rate of caries. This highlights the essential importance of cereals in the diet of the early farmers in the Middle Elbe-Saale region. As time went on, meat and dairy products became more and more important, which had a positive impact on dental health. The data also show sex-specific differences: women were more often affected by caries than men and female jaws also generally exhibited greater numbers of carious teeth than their male counterparts. Dental health is a reflection of both biological factors and of economic and sociocultural structures.",

With an ageing population the incidence of osteoporosis is growing. Osteoporotic fractures have significant individual morbidity but also strain Healthcare services. There is no screening service for osteoporotic fractures in the UK and physicians must actively identify patients who are at risk of osteoporotic fractures as well as managing appropriately patients who have sustained osteoporotic fractures. Diagnosis of osteoporosis is done with Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure Bone Mineral Density (BMD). The World Health Organisation Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) score is used to identify patients who are at risk of fractures. Pharmacological treatment is recommended for those who obtain a risk score sufficient enough to warrant treatment. The treatment of osteoporosis includes calcium and vitamin D replacement, bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide and hormone replacement therapy in women. Potential therapies that are currently undergoing clinical trials include Abaloparatide and Romosozumab.",

abstract = "Introduction
In this study, we aimed to determine the hospitalization rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in a southern-european country and its associated charges over a period of 16 years.
Methods
We identified all discharges with a primary diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) between 2000 and 2015 in data provided by the Central Administration of Health Services (ACSS). National estimates of hospitalization rates were assessed and adjusted to gender, age, population, and hospitalizations. Hospitalization charges were also assessed.
Results
There were an estimated 31 358 and 16 669 discharges for CD and UC, respectively. From 2000 to 2015, hospitalization rates per 100000 habitants increased for CD (8.4–11.2) and remained stable for UC (4.4–4.9). The hospitalization rate for IBD increased slightly over time (12.8 per 100 000 habitants in 2000 and 16.1 in 2015). Annual total hospitalization charges amounted to 4.0M€ in 2000 and 5.7M€ in 2015. This increase was mainly due to a rise in the total expenses of CD-related hospitalizations.
Conclusion
CD hospitalization rates per 100000 inhabitants increased over time while remaining constant for UC. Hospitalization charges for IBD increased approximately 2.0M€ during the study period, representing an important burden in the national healthcare system.",

The relative percentage of older people is growing, while fewer young employees are entering the labour force. This phenomenon is directly connected with ageing of the workforce. Older workers constitute a special group with characteristics that require special attention from the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) point of view. The aim of this paper is to address what changes occur in ageing workers as a result of physical and psychological processes and the possible impacts of these at work in relation to OHS and the concept of sustainable work and workplaces. In addition, this paper discusses factors affecting work ability and worker’s performance in relation to the ageing phenomenon. Finally, based on the literature, the paper proposes measures to minimize age-related risks and increase awareness. These measures should be designed and adopted at the early stages of working life and continue until retirement. By reducing risk factors of employees, the rate of occupational accidents and occupational diseases may be decreased, thus saving costs for employers, health system and insurance costs, while simultaneously facilitating a healthier retirement for the working-age population.",

The possibility to reach high coverage with immunizations that can guarantee a fundamental improvement of health for adults and the elderly can only be achieved through a coordinated effort where all stakeholders, under the coordination of public health, contribute to issue recommendations; create a functioning database for vaccine coverage registration; promote formative courses for healthcare workers and continuous information for the public; increase vaccines uptake among healthcare workers, who need to give the first testimony on the relevance of immunization.",

abstract = "Background
In the context of a rapidly ageing population, Singapore is anticipating a rise in multimorbidity, disability, and dependency, which are driven by physical frailty. Healthy Older People Everyday (HOPE) is an epidemiologic population-based study on community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older in Singapore.
Objective
To investigate the prevalence of frail and prefrail states and their association with polypharmacy, multimorbidity, cognitive and functional status, and perceived health status among community-dwelling older adults in Singapore.
Methods
Participants for HOPE were older adults aged 65 years and older recruited from a cohort study on the northwest region of Singapore. Analysis was performed on data collected from a combination of interviewer-administered questionnaires (including FRAIL scale, EQ-5D, Mini Mental State Examination, Barthel index, and Lawton IADL scale), clinical assessments, and physical measurements (including hand grip strength and Timed-Up-and-Go [TUG] test).
Results
A total of 1051 older adults (mean age 71.2 years) completed the study. More than half (57.2%) were female. The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty was 6.2% and 37%, respectively. Frailty was associated with older age, female gender, Indian (instead of Chinese) ethnicity, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment, weaker hand grip strength, longer TUG times, and poor perceived health status. Those with underlying cognitive impairment and frailty were at greater risk of adverse health outcome.
Conclusion
Frailty is a complex health state with multiple domains and dimensions. In our study in a multiethnic Asian population, we identified nonmodifiable factors and modifiable risk factors (multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive and functional impairment) that were associated with frailty. Interventions will have to be multipronged and will require a collaborated effort in order to effect change and improve the health span in rapidly ageing populations.",

Methods
The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

We investigate whether higher regional employment levels are associated with better health over and above individual level employment. Individual level data (N = 23,078 aged 15–64 years) were taken from 16 countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) participating in the 2014 European Social Survey. Regional employment rates were extracted from Eurostat, corresponding with the start (2008) and end (2013) of the Great Recession. Health outcomes included self-reported heart or circulation problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, self-rated health, depression, obesity and allergies (as a falsification test). We calculated multilevel Poisson regression models, which included individuals nested within regions, controlling for potential confounding variables and country fixed effects. After adjustment for individual level socio-demographic factors, higher average regional employment rates (from 2008 to 2013) were associated with better health outcomes. Individual level worklessness was associated with worsened health outcomes, most strongly with poor self-rated health. In models including both individual worklessness and the average regional employment rate, regional employment remained associated with heart and circulation problems, depression and obesity. There was evidence of an interaction between individual worklessness and regional employment for poor self-rated health and depression. The findings suggest that across 16 European countries, for some key outcomes, higher levels of employment in the regional labour market may be beneficial for the health of the local population.",

abstract = "Background & Aims
Population growth and changes in demographic structure are linked to trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. The aim of this study is to estimate future CRC incidence in the ageing population, and compare trends across developing and developed regions.
Methods
Cancer and population data were extracted from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Annual incidence rates for the major types of cancer in 118 selected populations were extracted from 102 cancer registries in 39 countries worldwide. We selected 8 jurisdictions (from the United States, Europe, and Asia) that reported 20-year cancer incidence rates since 1988. Time series models were constructed to project cancer incidence, by sex and age, to 2030. Incidence rates for persons older than 65 years were combined and further adjusted for change of ageing population. We compared age-adjusted incidence rates among the jurisdictions.
Results
The total population older than 65 years old was 12,917,794 in 1988, and the number increased by almost 40% to 17,950,115 in 2007. In developed countries in the West CRC incidence is predicted to decrease by 16.3% in the United States, increase by 4.8% in the United Kingdom, and increase by 4.7% in Sweden by 2030. In developing countries, such as China (Shanghai), Croatia, and Costa Rica, CRC incidence is predicted to increase in a steep curve by 2030 because of the growing population and ageing effect; in 2030, the incidence increases were 60.5% for China, 47.0% for Croatia, and 18.5% for Costa Rica. We also predict CRC incidence will increase greatly by 2030 in Japan and Hong Kong, which are developed regions.
Conclusions
With the exception of the United States, the incidence of CRC is expected to continue to rise in most regions in the coming decades, due to population growth and changes in demographic structure. The predicted increases are more marked in developing regions with limited health care resources.",

abstract = "Background
Aging populations have led to increasing numbers of seniors presenting for emergency surgery. Older patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization, and increased institutionalization. We hypothesized that increased frailty would be a risk factor for increased health care costs in elderly surgical patients who have undergone emergency abdominal surgery.
Methods
A prospective cost analysis of emergency general surgery patients 65 years of age and older was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Preadmission Clinical Frailty Scale score and Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications were collected. Patients were followed for 6 months after discharge. Hospitalization costs were calculated using the Alberta Health Services (AHS) microcosting database; other costs were obtained from Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health databases. The primary outcome was total insured cost (2016 Can$). Multivariate generalized linear regression of log-transformed costs was conducted.
Results
Overall, 321 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 7.8), median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3, mean length of stay was 15.9 days (standard deviation 23.4), and 48% suffered a complication. Median total insured cost was Can$18,021 and median total cost was Can$26,739. Multivariate analysis found American Society of Anesthesiologists score (adjusted ratio [AR] = 1.24, P = .001), CFS (AR = 1.27, P < .001), major complications (AR = 2.11, P < .001), and minor complications (AR = 1.48, P < .001) lead to increased total insured costs.
Conclusion
Costs increased—after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and preadmission function as frailty—and American Society of Anesthesiologists score increased if minor or major complications occurred. The detection of frailty represents an opportunity to target risk-reduction strategies and interventions to improve outcomes and decrease cost.",

abstract = "Background
Few studies consider multiple pathways for explaining the gendered patterns of depression in Europe’s aged population, although ageing is often associated with an increased exposure to risk factors for depression, and the relevance of these risk factors is likely to differ between countries.
Methods
Based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we assess the relevance of gender inequalities in the exposure to psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors for explaining the gender gap in depression. Further, we investigate the association between depressive symptoms and these explanatory variables by gender and analyse whether their relevance differs between countries.
Results
Both the prevalence of depression by gender and the magnitude of the gender gap were low in Northern Europe and rather high in Southern Europe. Part of the gender gap was explained by psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors but significant gender differences remained. Health-related factors were of outstanding importance for explaining within-country variation in depressive symptoms for both women and men. With regard to psychosocial and socio-economic factors, the results were less clear.
Conclusion
The assessment of gender inequalities in depression and their determinants within different social policy contexts enables evidence-based interventions to reduce the gender gap and ensure high quality of life for older men and women. To that end, the reduction of health-related risk factors seems to be of utmost importance in all European countries, whereas interventions in the area of socio-economic and psychosocial risk factors should be gender- and context-specific.",

Although Israel is still young in years, with relatively high birth rates and older people (individuals aged 65 years or older) constituting only about 11% of its population, the absolute number of older people is growing rapidly. Life expectancy is high, and increasing numbers of people are living to advanced old age (older than 85 years). A wide spectrum of geriatric care is provided within a universal system providing health services to all citizens. Community and institutional care is available, and many innovative programmes are being developed. The unique demographic characteristics of the ageing society in Israel reflect cultural and multiethnic diversity, in addition to a high rate of immigration of older people. To meet the growing challenges, address disparities, and search for innovation will require planning and development of adequate services at the highest level.",

Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

abstract = "Objectives
This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

Considering patient satisfaction in the relationship aspect of helping and communication can contribute to improving nursing care. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement.

It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

abstract = "Advances in technology have made it possible for many standard diagnostic and health monitoring procedures, traditionally carried out by qualified personnel within medical facilities, to be reliably undertaken by patients or carers in their own homes with a minimum of basic training. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

Despite relatively good vaccination rates in childhood in many parts of the world, vaccines to prevent diseases are underused in the adult population and adult vaccination rates are still far below the target.

Adult vaccination is a good example of a public health initiative aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, but awareness of the need for adult vaccination and uptake of the programs across Europe is variable. The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’. Hence, we consider ADVICE a very timely and very valuable initiative to draw a roadmap to improve adult vaccination rates in Europe.",

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition.

The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide.

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

Currently available combinations of estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators moderately increase BMD without causing the extra-skeletal adverse effects of each compound alone. The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has recently been shown to decrease vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fracture rates and is nearing approval. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile.

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%.

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

abstract = "Hip fractures rank in the top ten disabling conditions worldwide. With an ageing population, this public health problem is expected to increase. Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

abstract = "Background
With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

abstract = "The rising numbers in the aging population will undoubtedly lead to a corresponding increase in percutaneous endovascular procedures to address their cardiovascular health issues. With a constant drive to develop innovative treatment methods to achieve improved treatment outcomes while reducing procedural-related complications, endovascular interventionalists have focused on technologies to provide efficient hemostatic control of femoral artery access following percutaneous diagnostic or therapeutic angiographic procedures. Compared with the traditional hemostatic method using manual compression, several arterial closure devices (ACD) have been shown to reduce time of hemostasis, enable early patient ambulation, reduce hospitalization staff use, and improve patient outcome. However, these ACDs have their shortcomings as the interventionalists need to be familiar with these technologies as well as their potential complications. This article provides a comprehensive review of current closure device technologies as well as clinical experiences with these devices. The adjunctive role of these technologies in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair is also discussed.",

abstract = "Objectives
The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

abstract = "Background
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

A further challenge is the infertility of the European populations. The consequent burden to our health system means that there has to be a far closer understanding between patients and the pharmaceutical industry about the medicines that are produced, side effects, adverse effects and how necessary it is for these patient reported outcomes to be fed back to the industry. For too long, the industry and patients have been kept apart by clinicians and certainly, in more recent times, by the media. This is having a very adverse effect upon our health economy and should be rectified wherever possible. Partnership and constant dialogue between industry and patients using the well established Dr/Patient relationship is essential for the joint responsibility of managing health.",

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

Using three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (N = 10,923), we find that rural elderly women are the most vulnerable to social exclusion (17.28%) and cognitive impairment (18.52%) among the Chinese elderly. After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

When comparing the scores of cognitive status of the participants who were non-frail (n = 12,729, 47.4%) versus pre-frail (n = 11,559, 43.2%) and non-frail versus frail (n = 2452, 9.4%) subgroups, significant statistical differences were found for both comparisons (M ± SD = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.50-0.62, p < 0.001 and M ± SD = 3.43, 95%CI: 2.26–4.60, p < 0.001, respectively). It is clear that poor cognitive function is strongly closed associated with pre-frailty and frailty subgroups in older populations around the world.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

abstract = "Background
In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.",

A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women.

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

abstract = "This paper investigates how the demand for residential real estate depends on age and other demographic characteristics at the household level. Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

abstract = "Objectives
This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

Considering patient satisfaction in the relationship aspect of helping and communication can contribute to improving nursing care. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement.

It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

abstract = "Bronchiectasis is clinically defined as irreversible airways dilatation associated with chronic inflammation and infection. It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy.

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

abstract = "Advances in technology have made it possible for many standard diagnostic and health monitoring procedures, traditionally carried out by qualified personnel within medical facilities, to be reliably undertaken by patients or carers in their own homes with a minimum of basic training. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

Adult vaccination is a good example of a public health initiative aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, but awareness of the need for adult vaccination and uptake of the programs across Europe is variable. The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’. Hence, we consider ADVICE a very timely and very valuable initiative to draw a roadmap to improve adult vaccination rates in Europe.",

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

abstract = "In the elderly population, ageing frequently impacts on the different aspects of oral physiology that play a key role in eating behavior. In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition. To meet this challenge, we looked for the concept of “oral comfort” when eating a food. The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

Currently available combinations of estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators moderately increase BMD without causing the extra-skeletal adverse effects of each compound alone. The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has recently been shown to decrease vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fracture rates and is nearing approval. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. Several other agents are currently in earlier clinical and preclinical phases of development, including dickkopf-1 antagonists, activin A antagonists, β-arrestin analogs, calcilytics, and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff.

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

Multi-stakeholder collaborations, government commitment, inclusion of older persons and policies that tackled both the physical and social environments were key factors that contributed towards approaches and interventions used to create age-friendly cities and communities. The characteristics of age-friendly initiatives identified provide a promising basis for the development of ageing policy and planning globally to make cities more supportive of older people.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

abstract = "Hip fractures rank in the top ten disabling conditions worldwide. With an ageing population, this public health problem is expected to increase. Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

Several studies show that cellular senescence is tightly interconnected to aging and AD, while the role of telomere dynamic and stability in AD pathogenesis is still unclear.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

The consequent burden to our health system means that there has to be a far closer understanding between patients and the pharmaceutical industry about the medicines that are produced, side effects, adverse effects and how necessary it is for these patient reported outcomes to be fed back to the industry. For too long, the industry and patients have been kept apart by clinicians and certainly, in more recent times, by the media.

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

abstract = "Background
In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.",

A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women.

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

Considering patient satisfaction in the relationship aspect of helping and communication can contribute to improving nursing care. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement.

It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.

We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy.

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

Adult vaccination is a good example of a public health initiative aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, but awareness of the need for adult vaccination and uptake of the programs across Europe is variable. The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’.

abstract = "Summary
The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition. To meet this challenge, we looked for the concept of “oral comfort” when eating a food. The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

abstract = "The morbidity and mortality associated with fractures due to osteoporosis or “porous bone” contributes significantly to global healthcare costs and will increase exponentially with ageing populations. In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%.

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

The consequent burden to our health system means that there has to be a far closer understanding between patients and the pharmaceutical industry about the medicines that are produced, side effects, adverse effects and how necessary it is for these patient reported outcomes to be fed back to the industry. For too long, the industry and patients have been kept apart by clinicians and certainly, in more recent times, by the media. This is having a very adverse effect upon our health economy and should be rectified wherever possible.

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding
None.",

A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects.

A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women.

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

abstract = "Objectives:
To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

abstract = "Objectives
This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

Considering patient satisfaction in the relationship aspect of helping and communication can contribute to improving nursing care. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

We develop a lifecycle general equilibrium model with endogenous retirement that embeds Social Security legislation and Medicare. Individuals are ex ante heterogeneous with respect to their preferences for leisure and face uncertainty about labor productivity, health status and out-of-pocket medical expenses. The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement.",

abstract = "Background
It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy.

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition. To meet this challenge, we looked for the concept of “oral comfort” when eating a food. The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%.

abstract = "Purpose
Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

abstract = "Hip fractures rank in the top ten disabling conditions worldwide. With an ageing population, this public health problem is expected to increase. Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

abstract = "Background
With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects.

Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

Longer elderly walking duration (per week) was associated with whether the elderly is working and the elderly's perceived availability of social interaction areas and shops.

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

This pressure can be alleviated by focusing on community-based healthcare and empowering people to proactively manage their own general wellness. To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.",

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

abstract = "Objectives:
To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

abstract = "Objectives
This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

We develop a lifecycle general equilibrium model with endogenous retirement that embeds Social Security legislation and Medicare. Individuals are ex ante heterogeneous with respect to their preferences for leisure and face uncertainty about labor productivity, health status and out-of-pocket medical expenses. The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement.",

abstract = "Background
It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy.

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily.

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition. To meet this challenge, we looked for the concept of “oral comfort” when eating a food. The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

abstract = "The morbidity and mortality associated with fractures due to osteoporosis or “porous bone” contributes significantly to global healthcare costs and will increase exponentially with ageing populations. In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

abstract = "As our elderly population increases in proportion with respect to the rest of society, age-related driving impairments are increasing in importance as a public health concern. In this context, health professionals play an important role in identifying impaired drivers. This situation is complicated for two reasons: discussion of driving cessation is a sensitive topic for both health professionals and the elderly, and physicians have limited familiarity with the current American Medical Association (AMA) screening guidelines or mandated reporting laws. To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%. Fully 92% stated they had developed a better understanding of California's mandated reporting laws. Similarly, 92% said they had developed a better understanding of the medical conditions and medications that may impair older adults’ ability to drive safely. Furthermore, 91% said mandated-reporting laws helped protect the safety of patients and others, and 59% said it was easier to discuss and justify driving cessation with patients. In-person training of health professionals on age-related driving impairments was well received and resulted in increased self-reported knowledge, confidence to screen, and intent to screen. Physicians were supportive of mandatory reporting laws.",

abstract = "Purpose
Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

abstract = "Hip fractures rank in the top ten disabling conditions worldwide. With an ageing population, this public health problem is expected to increase. Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

abstract = "Rapidly aging society is a global phenomenon with serious societal impact. With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

Aim
To explore care needs of Chinese empty-nest elderly people and to provide reference information for relevant authorities in making care-supporting policies.
Method
A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

abstract = "Purpose
Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

Longer elderly walking duration (per week) was associated with whether the elderly is working and the elderly's perceived availability of social interaction areas and shops.

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

This pressure can be alleviated by focusing on community-based healthcare and empowering people to proactively manage their own general wellness. To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

A combination of actions is needed, including educational programs, such as those developed by the American Academy of Home Care Physicians (AAHCP), changes in financial incentives, and changes in the culture and practice of health care, to make the home the primary focus of care for these vulnerable, underserved individuals rather than an afterthought.",

A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.",

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

abstract = "Objectives
This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

Econ. 11 (6), 925–985.], estimate that improvements in health have no impact on growth or any factors of growth; in particular, they find no impact of life expectancy increases on education. We argue that their pessimistic results with respect to schooling investment is due to the use of an imprecise proxy. Indeed, when life expectancy increases at time t, only the cohort born at t should increase its human capital investment. On the contrary, [Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., 2006. Disease and Development: The Effect of Life Expectancy on Economic Growth. Technical Report. National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.] look at the impact of life expectancy improvements on the average education of the whole working age population, which evolves much slower. We have reproduced their estimations with a cohort-based measure of education11The updated Cohen-Soto data and those used in this paper are available on: http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/cohen-daniel/international-educational-attainment-database/ and find a positive and significant impact of life expectancy on education, of 20%–50%, which is in line with the expected magnitude of the Ben-Porath effect according to the theoretical literature.",

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement.",

abstract = "Background
It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs.

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images.

Close surveillance of outbreaks and herd immunity are also at the forefront, even in industrialized countries, where previously eradicated viruses are now at risk of re-emergence due to instances of strain recombination, contractions in viral vector geographies, and from their potential use as agents of bioterrorism. There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

Adult vaccination is a good example of a public health initiative aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, but awareness of the need for adult vaccination and uptake of the programs across Europe is variable. The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’.

However, the impact of age is of more concern given that cost increases are concentrated in the last few years of life and there may be cohort effects as the “Baby-Boom” generation ages. There is an urgent need to better understand the exact mechanisms driving health expenditure increases given that time accounts for approximately two-thirds of health expenditure increases and that its effect is non-linear.",

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition. To meet this challenge, we looked for the concept of “oral comfort” when eating a food. The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

In addition, it considers critical areas of an effective public health response including heat response plans, the use of remote sensing and GIS methodologies, and the importance of effective communications strategies.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

abstract = "The morbidity and mortality associated with fractures due to osteoporosis or “porous bone” contributes significantly to global healthcare costs and will increase exponentially with ageing populations. In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

One of the identified ways of achieving this was to provide professional development that was also personal development for each individual in the organization. This personal /professional development involved the creation and implementation of a program in personal leadership for all front-line staff of the organization. This learning, it was believed, would lead to the transformation of the work environment and, subsequently, the culture of the workplace. This article describes the development and implementation of a pilot program in personal leadership within Interior Health. Results to date demonstrate the promise of this program to effect profound cultural change through the development of personal mastery and personal leadership…for everyone.",

In this context, health professionals play an important role in identifying impaired drivers. This situation is complicated for two reasons: discussion of driving cessation is a sensitive topic for both health professionals and the elderly, and physicians have limited familiarity with the current American Medical Association (AMA) screening guidelines or mandated reporting laws. To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%. Fully 92% stated they had developed a better understanding of California's mandated reporting laws. Similarly, 92% said they had developed a better understanding of the medical conditions and medications that may impair older adults’ ability to drive safely. Furthermore, 91% said mandated-reporting laws helped protect the safety of patients and others, and 59% said it was easier to discuss and justify driving cessation with patients. In-person training of health professionals on age-related driving impairments was well received and resulted in increased self-reported knowledge, confidence to screen, and intent to screen. Physicians were supportive of mandatory reporting laws.",

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

abstract = "Hip fractures rank in the top ten disabling conditions worldwide. With an ageing population, this public health problem is expected to increase. Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).

Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

Using three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (N = 10,923), we find that rural elderly women are the most vulnerable to social exclusion (17.28%) and cognitive impairment (18.52%) among the Chinese elderly. After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects.

Aim
To explore care needs of Chinese empty-nest elderly people and to provide reference information for relevant authorities in making care-supporting policies.
Method
A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

abstract = "Purpose
Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

This pressure can be alleviated by focusing on community-based healthcare and empowering people to proactively manage their own general wellness. To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

This article discusses workforce development, which is a critical issue for future planning, as recently highlighted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Key aspects of recruitment, training, and retention of home care workers are discussed, including those who provide basic support for activities of daily living as well as a variety of skilled professionals: therapists, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. Although the geriatric workforce shortage affects all care settings, it is especially critical in home health care, in part because we are starting with far too few clinicians to meet the medical needs of homebound elderly. A combination of actions is needed, including educational programs, such as those developed by the American Academy of Home Care Physicians (AAHCP), changes in financial incentives, and changes in the culture and practice of health care, to make the home the primary focus of care for these vulnerable, underserved individuals rather than an afterthought.",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.",

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

abstract = "In healthy adults microbial communities that colonise different regions of the human colon contribute nutrients and energy to the host via the fermentation of non-digestible dietary components in the large intestine. A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

We describe lessons learned in Asia from recent HF registries and clinical trial databases and outline strategies to improve the potential for success in future trials.

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement.",

abstract = "Background
It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy.

With the average life expectancy continuing to climb, understanding patterns of morbidity in aging populations has become progressively more important. Cancer is an age-related disease, whose risk has been proven to increase with age. Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection.

abstract = "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading cause of visual impairments in the working age population in the developed world. It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

The European Federation of Internal Medicine (EFIM), declared that ‘internal medicine must focus on better care for individuals, better health care for populations and lower costs’. Adult vaccination is a good example of a public health initiative aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, but awareness of the need for adult vaccination and uptake of the programs across Europe is variable. The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’. Hence, we consider ADVICE a very timely and very valuable initiative to draw a roadmap to improve adult vaccination rates in Europe.",

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition.

The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

abstract = "The morbidity and mortality associated with fractures due to osteoporosis or “porous bone” contributes significantly to global healthcare costs and will increase exponentially with ageing populations. In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

Currently available combinations of estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators moderately increase BMD without causing the extra-skeletal adverse effects of each compound alone. The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has recently been shown to decrease vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fracture rates and is nearing approval. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile.

An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

In this context, health professionals play an important role in identifying impaired drivers. This situation is complicated for two reasons: discussion of driving cessation is a sensitive topic for both health professionals and the elderly, and physicians have limited familiarity with the current American Medical Association (AMA) screening guidelines or mandated reporting laws. To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%. Fully 92% stated they had developed a better understanding of California's mandated reporting laws. Similarly, 92% said they had developed a better understanding of the medical conditions and medications that may impair older adults’ ability to drive safely. Furthermore, 91% said mandated-reporting laws helped protect the safety of patients and others, and 59% said it was easier to discuss and justify driving cessation with patients. In-person training of health professionals on age-related driving impairments was well received and resulted in increased self-reported knowledge, confidence to screen, and intent to screen. Physicians were supportive of mandatory reporting laws.",

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

abstract = "Hip fractures rank in the top ten disabling conditions worldwide. With an ageing population, this public health problem is expected to increase. Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013.

Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

abstract = "Objectives
The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

Despite this long-standing interest, a consensus definition has proven to be a difficult task, due to the inherent challenge involved in defining such a complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon. The lack of a clear set of defining characteristics for the construct of successful aging has made comparison of findings across studies difficult and has limited advances in aging research. A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.",

Empty-nest elders have considerable needs for daily living, health care, and social support in China. The growing need for care of an aging population requires to be met through adequate policy decision making by government.
Aim
To explore care needs of Chinese empty-nest elderly people and to provide reference information for relevant authorities in making care-supporting policies.
Method
A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

abstract = "Purpose
Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

abstract = "Publicly provided healthcare systems are coming under increasing pressure worldwide because of aging populations, increased prevalence of chronic disease and spiralling healthcare costs. This pressure can be alleviated by focusing on community-based healthcare and empowering people to proactively manage their own general wellness. To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.",

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household’s human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

abstract = "With regards to home care, primary care nurses should carry out their activities and performance with an emphasis on health education. Considering patient satisfaction in the relationship aspect of helping and communication can contribute to improving nursing care. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

abstract = "In healthy adults microbial communities that colonise different regions of the human colon contribute nutrients and energy to the host via the fermentation of non-digestible dietary components in the large intestine. A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement.",

abstract = "Background
It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

abstract = "Background and aims
The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

abstract = "Both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and osteoporosis are major public health problems associated with an aging population. Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mineral density, while CKD results in qualitative changes in bone structure; both conditions increase the predisposition to fragility fractures. There is a significant coprevalence of osteoporotic fractures and CKD, particularly in the elderly population. Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of osteoporosis, the impact of CKD on bone strength, and the role of novel imaging techniques and biomarkers in predicting underlying renal osteodystrophy on bone histomorphometry in the context of CKD.",

With the average life expectancy continuing to climb, understanding patterns of morbidity in aging populations has become progressively more important. Cancer is an age-related disease, whose risk has been proven to increase with age. Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

abstract = "Background
A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

abstract = "The increasing prevalence of heart disease and diabetes among aging populations in low and middle income countries leads to questions regarding the degree to which endogenous early life exposures (exposures in utero) are important determinants of these health conditions. We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

Despite relatively good vaccination rates in childhood in many parts of the world, vaccines to prevent diseases are underused in the adult population and adult vaccination rates are still far below the target. The European Federation of Internal Medicine (EFIM), declared that ‘internal medicine must focus on better care for individuals, better health care for populations and lower costs’. Adult vaccination is a good example of a public health initiative aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, but awareness of the need for adult vaccination and uptake of the programs across Europe is variable. The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’. Hence, we consider ADVICE a very timely and very valuable initiative to draw a roadmap to improve adult vaccination rates in Europe.",

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

In the context of an aging population, it is crucial to develop a food supply tailored for the elderly people in order to prevent the onset of malnutrition.

The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

abstract = "Objective
To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

abstract = "The morbidity and mortality associated with fractures due to osteoporosis or “porous bone” contributes significantly to global healthcare costs and will increase exponentially with ageing populations. In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

abstract = "Since the identification of osteoporosis as a major health issue in aging populations and the subsequent development of the first treatment modalities for its management, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling bone turnover and disease pathophysiology, thus enabling the pinpointing of new targets for intervention. This progress, along with advances in biotechnology, has rendered possible the development of ever more sophisticated treatments employing novel mechanisms of action. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, approved for the treatment of postmenopausal and male osteoporosis, significantly and continuously increases bone mineral density (BMD) and maintains a low risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures for up to 8years. Currently available combinations of estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators moderately increase BMD without causing the extra-skeletal adverse effects of each compound alone. The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has recently been shown to decrease vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fracture rates and is nearing approval. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. Several other agents are currently in earlier clinical and preclinical phases of development, including dickkopf-1 antagonists, activin A antagonists, β-arrestin analogs, calcilytics, and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

abstract = "Objectives
An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

In this context, health professionals play an important role in identifying impaired drivers. This situation is complicated for two reasons: discussion of driving cessation is a sensitive topic for both health professionals and the elderly, and physicians have limited familiarity with the current American Medical Association (AMA) screening guidelines or mandated reporting laws. To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%. Fully 92% stated they had developed a better understanding of California's mandated reporting laws. Similarly, 92% said they had developed a better understanding of the medical conditions and medications that may impair older adults’ ability to drive safely. Furthermore, 91% said mandated-reporting laws helped protect the safety of patients and others, and 59% said it was easier to discuss and justify driving cessation with patients. In-person training of health professionals on age-related driving impairments was well received and resulted in increased self-reported knowledge, confidence to screen, and intent to screen. Physicians were supportive of mandatory reporting laws.",

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

abstract = "Objective
To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

abstract = "Background
Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

abstract = "We are in the ‘age of the old’ and should be celebrating this incredible achievement by the human race but like many things, an ageing population brings with it a number of social challenges: the importance of the carers - and in turn their health - plus the longer we live the more diseases we acquire. A further challenge is the infertility of the European populations. The consequent burden to our health system means that there has to be a far closer understanding between patients and the pharmaceutical industry about the medicines that are produced, side effects, adverse effects and how necessary it is for these patient reported outcomes to be fed back to the industry. For too long, the industry and patients have been kept apart by clinicians and certainly, in more recent times, by the media. This is having a very adverse effect upon our health economy and should be rectified wherever possible. Partnership and constant dialogue between industry and patients using the well established Dr/Patient relationship is essential for the joint responsibility of managing health.",

abstract = "Objectives
The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

abstract = "Background
In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.
Funding

abstract = "The concept of ‘successful aging’ has long intrigued the scientific community. Despite this long-standing interest, a consensus definition has proven to be a difficult task, due to the inherent challenge involved in defining such a complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon. The lack of a clear set of defining characteristics for the construct of successful aging has made comparison of findings across studies difficult and has limited advances in aging research. A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.",

Empty-nest elders have considerable needs for daily living, health care, and social support in China. The growing need for care of an aging population requires to be met through adequate policy decision making by government.
Aim
To explore care needs of Chinese empty-nest elderly people and to provide reference information for relevant authorities in making care-supporting policies.
Method
A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

abstract = "Summary
Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

This pressure can be alleviated by focusing on community-based healthcare and empowering people to proactively manage their own general wellness. To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.",

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",

abstract = "Background
Skin conditions and dermatological diseases associated with advanced age (e.g. fungal infection, dry skin and itch) receive increasingly attention in clinical practice and research. Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives
The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods
A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results
Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions
Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future.",

abstract = "Background
With an increasing ageing population, hip fractures have become a major public health issue in the elderly. It is important to examine the health status (HS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly faced with the epidemic of hip fractures.
Objective
To provide an overview of reported HS and HRQOL in elderly patients with a hip fracture.
Design
A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Google Scholar in July 2014. Studies which reported the HS or HRQOL based on standardised questionnaires in patients older than 65 years with a hip fracture were considered eligible for inclusion.
Results
After inspecting the 2725 potentially eligible studies, 49 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies were randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Patients’ functioning on the physical, social, and emotional domains were affected after a hip fracture. The HS and HRQOL of the majority of patients recovered in the first 6 months after fracture. However, their HS did not return to prefracture level. Mental state, prefracture functioning on physical and psychosocial domains, comorbidity, female gender, nutritional status, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and complications were factors associated with HS or HRQOL. Treatment with total hip arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty provided better HS than treatment with internal fixation with displaced femoral neck fractures. Supportive psychotherapy in “low-functioning” patients, (home) rehabilitation programmes and nutritional supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects on HS.
Conclusions
Optimizing nutrition intake, (home) rehabilitation programmes, and the possibility for psychological counselling in patients with difficulties in the psychosocial dimensions would be recommended after hip fracture surgery. Besides HS questionnaires like EQ-5D and SF-36, adequate measurements like the WHOQOL-Bref or ICECAP-O are warranted in future studies regarding hip fracture surgery and postoperative treatment options.",

This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance.
Methods
Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed.
Results
We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats.
Conclusions
Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.",

abstract = "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they “did age” in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting “older people” in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers.",

Considering patient satisfaction in the relationship aspect of helping and communication can contribute to improving nursing care. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, whose aim is to assess the degree of patient satisfaction in relation to nursing care provided at home, particularly in the dimensions of relationships, communication and health education. To conduct this research an intentional non-probabilistic sample, consisting of 44 dependent patients, belonging to the area of a health centre in the central region of Portugal, who receive nursing care at home was selected. The data collection instrument used was a form, consisting of two parts: the first part to characterise the sample with 10 questions, one of which is subdivided and the second part consisting of 16 Likert type scale questions to obtain the patients’ opinions. From our results we stress that our sample had a very aged population, mostly residing in urban areas. Satisfaction was evaluated in three dimensions: relationships, communication and health education. With regard to relationships, older males (age range 88-98 years), who are more highly dependent, married, uneducated and living in rural districts are more satisfied. Regarding communication, older males (88-98 years), with a greater degree of dependency, bachelors, educated and living in urban parishes are most satisfied. As for the health education dimension, younger men (68-78 years), who are less dependent, married, educated and living in urban environments are more satisfied. The main conclusions inferred are that, in the overall assessment of all of the dimensions, the classification is very good, and it is suggested that organizational investments are made and to equip health centres with human and material resources.",

A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000. Changes in Social Security policy – which became much more generous – and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement.",

abstract = "Background
It is unknown whether newer, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and older tricyclic antidepressants are used similarly regardless of the geographical area of residence and education.
Methods
We included four randomly sampled cohorts of the Finnish working aged population (n = 998,540–1,033,135). The sampling (Dec 31st in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2010) resulted in non-overlapping time windows where each participant was followed up for four years for the first antidepressant use. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined whether the hazard of antidepressant use differed between the capital area and three other areas (Southern, Western and Northern/Eastern Finland). Educational differences were examined using four sub-groups: capital area/high education (reference category); other areas/high education; capital area/low education; and other areas/low education.
Results
Hazard ratios for the use of newer antidepressants were significantly lower in all other areas compared to the capital area after adjustment for age, sex, marital status, employment status, education, income, and area-level unemployment. Findings remained consistent in all time windows, differences increasing slightly. In the sub-group analysis those with low education had the lowest level of use in all areas, also within the capital area. The results were opposite for older antidepressants in all but the last time window.
Limitations
Some degree of unmeasured confounding and exposure misclassification is likely to exist.
Conclusions
Newer antidepressants were more commonly used in the capital than in the other areas, and among those with high versus low education. These differences in antidepressant use suggest socioeconomic inequalities in the mental health treatment quality.",

It is a cause of chronic cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of diagnosed bronchiectasis is probably increasing as a result of an ageing population and the increased use of radiological investigations. The diagnosis is secured by high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which should prompt referral to a specialist unit to investigate for one of many underlying causes. These can be diagnosed in up to 65% of patients and when made can significantly alter management. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis is best understood as a vicious cycle of inflammation and infection. Although clinical trial data are often lacking, there are many treatment options that target each of the steps within this cycle. These include the use of airway clearance techniques, mucoactive agents, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for both exacerbation and prophylaxis. This intensive approach is necessary as there is a considerable associated morbidity, mortality and health economic cost. However, patient adherence to such complex and long-term treatment can be difficult. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.",

Determinants of public sector health expenditure, by contrast, are less well understood. This study examines a complex relationship across government health expenditure (GHE), sociopolitical risks, and international aid, while taking into account the impacts of national income, debt and tax financing and aging populations on health spending. We apply a fixed-effects two-stage least squares regression method to a panel dataset comprising 120 countries for the years 1995 through 2010. Our results show that democratic accountability has a diminishing positive correlation with GHE, and that levels of GHE are higher when government is more stable. Corruption is associated with less GHE in developing countries, but with higher GHE in developed countries. We also find that development assistance for health (DAH) is fungible with domestically financed government health expenditure (DGHE). For an average country, a 1% increase in DAH to government is associated with a 0.03–0.04% decrease in DGHE. Furthermore, the degree of fungibility of DAH to government is higher in countries where corruption or ethnic tensions are widespread. However, DAH to non-governmental organizations is not fungible with DGHE.",

An extensive survey of the opinions of Czech geriatricians performed in spring 2013 addressing all the 230 geriatricians registered in the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně was focused on the situation in ambulatory geriatric care, the experience with the demand for it, the approach of health insurance companies, and the cooperation with other physicians. The survey has identified that the major obstacle to the development of geriatrics is the persisting artificial separation of medical and social care. Its negative consequence is a breach of the complexity and consistency of care and the cooperation among specialists. A real threat to the development of ambulatory geriatric care is particularly the existing financing system of ambulatory geriatric services and the unofficial “stop state” of health insurance companies that prevent new contractual relationships. Another obstacle is the lack of readily available relevant information, so that the demand for specialist care remains on a low level. The phenomenon of the ageing population is still not perceived as a major challenge by the Czech society, and this situation is also reflected by the level of awareness and interest in these issues.",

The aim of this research was to examine the prevalence of diabetes in Italy over a 34-year period.
Methods and results
Self-reported diabetes was assessed in eight health interview surveys of representative samples of Italian population aged 20 years and over. Crude and standardised prevalence were calculated by age, sex, educational level and area of residence. Logistic models were fitted to calculate the contribution of age and BMI to the trend in prevalence. In 2013 nearly 3.4 million Italians had a diagnosis of diabetes, more than twice as many as in 1980. The crude prevalence of diabetes in men rose from 3.3% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2013 (+115%), and from 4.7% to 6.8% in women (+45%). The prevalence was almost stable during the eighties, and started to rise from the beginning of the nineties. One third of the increase in men and two thirds in women is due to the ageing of the population, since the age-standardised prevalence increased by 79% in men and 14% in women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased less steeply than diabetes, and their contribution to the trend in diabetes is less relevant than age. Prevalence rose more in the elderly, in low-educated men, and in high-educated women.
Conclusion
Given that the ageing population plays a considerable role in explaining the trend, and that the number of people in the oldest age groups will continue to grow, the rise in the number of individuals with diabetes will represent a severe challenge for the national health system.",

Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mineral density, while CKD results in qualitative changes in bone structure; both conditions increase the predisposition to fragility fractures. There is a significant coprevalence of osteoporotic fractures and CKD, particularly in the elderly population. Not only is the risk of fracture higher in the CKD population, but clinical outcomes are significantly worse, with substantial health care costs. Management of osteoporosis in the CKD population is particularly complex given the impact of renal osteodystrophy on bone quality and the limited safety and hard outcome data for current therapy in patients with severe CKD or on dialysis therapy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of osteoporosis, the impact of CKD on bone strength, and the role of novel imaging techniques and biomarkers in predicting underlying renal osteodystrophy on bone histomorphometry in the context of CKD.",

Limited information is published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011–2016) literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85–89, after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may “protect” from cancer in this age group.",

It is a complication of both types of diabetes mellitus, which affects the light perception part of the retina; and without timely treatment patients could lose their sight and eventually become blind. Automated methods for the detection and progression analysis of DR are considered as potential health-care need to stop disease propagation and to ensure improved management for DR. Aiming for the detection and progression analysis of DR, color fundus photography is considered as one of the best candidates for non-invasive imaging of the eye fundus. A list of methods has already been developed to analyse DR related changes in the retina using color fundus photographs. In this manuscript we review those automated methods. In order to accurately compare the evolution of DR over time, retinal images that are typically collected on an annual or biennial basis must be perfectly superimposed. However, in reality, for two separate photographic-eye examinations the patient is never in exactly the same position and also the camera may vary. Therefore, a registration method is applied prior to evolution computation. Knowing registration as a fundamental preprocessing step for longitudinal (over time) analysis, we also reviewed state-of-the art methods for the registration of color fundus images. The review summarizes the achievement so far and also identifies potential study areas for further improvement and future research toward more efficient and accurate DR progression analysis.",

(1) describe the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at risk for self-management non-adherence, and (2) examine the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden while controlling for sample socio-demographics.
Background
Chronic condition self-management is key to maintaining optimal health in the aging population of PLWH. Despite the efforts of providers, patients, and caregivers, self-management non-adherence is still a factor contributing to poor chronic condition self-management and subsequent poor health outcomes. Recent research has identified treatment burden as a risk factor of poor chronic disease self-management adherence.
Method
Cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a sub-sample of 103 community dwelling, men and women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS derived from a larger parent study examining physical activity patterns in PLWH.
Results
Participants reported an overall low level of treatment burden (M = 22.84; SD = 24.57), although 16% (n = 16) of the sample indicated experiencing high treatment burden. The number of chronic conditions (r = 0.25; p ≤ .01) and social capital (r = −0.19; p = .03) were significantly correlated with treatment burden. Multivariate analysis testing known antecedent correlates of treatment burden was statistically significant (p < .05), but only explained 8% of treatment burden's variance.
Conclusion
Findings have implications for nursing care of PLWH demonstrating a subset of PLWH experience high treatment burden related to chronic condition self-management. Findings also identify characteristics of PLWH who may be at high risk for treatment burden and subsequent self-management non-adherence.",

Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.",

abstract = "Background
An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual health checks, incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap.
Methods
We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual health checks with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3·5%. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters.
Findings
Annual health checks led to a mean QALY gain of 0·072 (95% CI 0·069–0·113) and mean incremental costs of £4911 (4897–5133). For a threshold of £30 000, annual health checks were not cost effective (mean ICER £89 200, 95% CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £258 to under £100 per year for annual health checks to be cost effective.
Interpretation
Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual health checks is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to health checks and health itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to ‘empower’ patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.",

With the aging population and improved cancer care, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. Planning for their care requires an understanding of the impact of cancer and chronic conditions on quality of life. We sought to determine chronic conditions and health status in older cancer survivors compared to controls.
Methods
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used survey data from 18,133 cancer survivors and 94,407 controls age 65 and older who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2009 telephonic survey. Our main measures were chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and arthritis) and poor health status (poor or fair self-rated health).
Results
Cancer survivors were older, more likely white, had higher education, and slightly more likely to have a healthcare provider and higher levels of emotional support. More survivors reported having 2 or more chronic conditions compared to controls (67.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Health status was lower for survivors, and was significantly different by racial/ethnic group. In a multivariable model for health status, having 2 or more chronic conditions was more strongly associated with poorer health status than cancer survivorship.
Conclusions
Cancer survivors had slightly higher numbers of chronic conditions and poorer health status than controls. However, chronic conditions were more strongly associated with poor health status than cancer. Monitoring for recurrence and second cancers is important in cancer survivors, but chronic conditions also need to be given priority due to their substantial impact on health status.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000–2009.
Methods
Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60–X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
Results
Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30–39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50–59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
Conclusion
Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.",

A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable.
Objectives
This paper examined the short-term mortality displacement (or “harvesting”) of heatwave, characterized the heatwave-mortality relationship, and estimated death burden and health costs attributable to heatwave among the elderly in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily data on the temperature and deaths of people aged ≥75 years in the five largest cities of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), totaling 368,767 deaths in different periods between 1988 and 2011. A total of 15-tiered heatwave definitions, based on intensity (95th to 99th percentiles of temperature distribution) and duration (two or more consecutive days), were used to quantify heatwave effects, using time-series regression and random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated attributable deaths for each city and by different types of heatwave. Potential economic benefits in monetary terms were also estimated, considering that heat-related deaths are avoidable.
Results
Among the Australian elderly population, we found significant associations between heatwave and deaths, with raised mortality immediately in the first few days followed by lower-than-expected mortality. In general, heatwave was associated with an average death increase of 28% (95% confidence interval: 15% to 42%), and greater increases were mostly observed for more intense heatwaves across multiple megacities. During the study period, there were dozens to hundreds of deaths attributable to heatwave for each city, equating to an economic loss of several million Australian dollars every year. Although the estimated attributable deaths varied by heatwave intensity and duration, the pattern was not consistent across cities.
Conclusions
Heatwave caused harvesting effects on mortality in the elderly population of Australia, and contributed to a substantial amount of death burden and indirect financial costs. To lessen the health impacts of heatwave in the affected regions, effective heatwave early warning systems and interventions targeted at the elderly population could be beneficial, both now and in the future.",

abstract = "The increasing prevalence of heart disease and diabetes among aging populations in low and middle income countries leads to questions regarding the degree to which endogenous early life exposures (exposures in utero) are important determinants of these health conditions. We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",

The Adult Vaccination Campaign in Europe (ADVICE) was developed with an aim to raise awareness for adult vaccination and to understand the dynamics of the vaccination practices and the possible barriers against achieving targeted vaccination rates in Europe. In order to reach vaccination targets, we need evidence based, up to date guidelines; recommendations at national and international levels; surveillance for vaccination rates; and opportunities to provide vaccines more readily. Leadership at a European level and a firm research and action agenda are crucial. The European Federation of Internal Medicine can take the lead as it declared its interest on ‘better care for individuals, better health care for populations’.

abstract = "Summary
The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing—but fragile and limited—health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.",

abstract = "Introduction
Frailty increases the risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization, and death in older adults and affects 7%–12% of the aging population. Secondary impacts of frailty on psychological health and socialization are significant negative contributors to poor outcomes for frail older adults.
Method
The My Active and Healthy Aging (My-AHA) consortium has developed an information and communications technology–based platform to support active and healthy aging through early detection of prefrailty and provision of individually tailored interventions, targeting multidomain risks for frailty across physical activity, cognitive activity, diet and nutrition, sleep, and psychosocial activities. Six hundred adults aged 60 years and older will be recruited to participate in a multinational, multisite 18-month randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the My-AHA platform to detect prefrailty and the efficacy of individually tailored interventions to prevent development of clinical frailty in this cohort. A total of 10 centers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, and Australia will participate in the randomized controlled trial.
Results
Pilot testing (Alpha Wave) of the My-AHA platform and all ancillary systems has been completed with a small group of older adults in Europe with the full randomized controlled trial scheduled to commence in 2018.
Discussion
The My-AHA study will expand the understanding of antecedent risk factors for clinical frailty so as to deliver targeted interventions to adults with prefrailty. Through the use of an information and communications technology platform that can connect with multiple devices within the older adult's own home, the My-AHA platform is designed to measure an individual's risk factors for frailty across multiple domains and then deliver personalized domain-specific interventions to the individual. The My-AHA platform is technology-agnostic, enabling the integration of new devices and sensor platforms as they emerge.",

The present study aimed at i) exploring the concept of oral comfort when eating according to elderly people in order to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the oral comfort when eating a food and ii) asking elderly people to evaluate various meat and cereal products using this questionnaire. Results of focus groups highlighted that oral comfort when eating a food is a multi-dimensional concept which includes dimensions related to food oral processing (ability to form and swallow food bolus), food sensory properties (texture and taste) and to a lesser extent pain sensations. Furthermore, the oral comfort questionnaire developed in the present study enabled a discrimination of products and highlighted the fact that some products supposed to fit with elderly people capacities and needs were not rated as the most comfortable foods by the elderly people. The concept of oral comfort when eating a food should be taken into account by those who are willing to design food products tailored to the elderly population. The questionnaire could be an interesting tool to assess oral comfort when eating a food in the elderly population.",

The main risk factor of these diseases is aging, and as the aging population in Western societies is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases is augmenting exponentially. Despite the great efforts to find a cure, current treatments remain ineffective or have low efficacy. Increasing lines of evidence point to exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation as common pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. We will address the role of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a potential target for the treatment of NDDs. The Nrf2–ARE pathway is an intrinsic mechanism of defence against oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a great number of cytoprotective and detoxificant genes. There are many evidences that highlight the protective role of the Nrf2–ARE pathway in neurodegenerative conditions, as it reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the Nrf2 pathway is being increasingly considered a therapeutic target for NDDs. Herein we will review the deregulation of the Nrf2 pathway in different NDDs and the recent studies with Nrf2 inducers as “proof-of-concept” for the treatment of those devastating pathologies.",

Background
Recent reviews indicate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with better cognitive functioning. In assessing these relationships in older individuals, previous studies have not taken into account medication usage that may support or compromise cognitive functioning.
Objective
To investigate the association between adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, cognition and medication usage in cognitively healthy older individuals.
Design
Data were assessed from individuals aged 60–90 years (mean = 77.8 years, SD = 6.7) from 15 independent living aged care villages around Melbourne, Australia. Participants' diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Cognition was assessed using reaction times from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Prescribed medications were recorded and analysed using binary measures. Cluster analyses were used to group participants in terms of cognitive measures and medications taken. Analyses controlled for age, gender, average daily kilojoule (kJ) intake and medication cluster.
Results
The relationship between cognitive speed clusters and medication clusters was significant (Chi-squared = 10.63, df = 3, p = 0.014). The odds ratio of 1.533 for average daily food intake suggested that for each additional kilojoule of average daily intake, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster increased by 53% and odds ratio of 0.573 for Mediterranean diet score suggested that for every additional unit, the odds of belonging to the slower reaction time cluster declined by 43%. The relationship between Mediterranean diet score and cognition was only significant when medication use was taken into account.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that when medications are considered, a higher Mediterranean diet score is associated with a faster response on cognitive function tests. The present findings also indicate that it is pertinent to take into account medication use when investigating relationships between dietary status and cognitive performance.",

The growing aging population and the increasingly healthcare costs demand a new paradigm for the healthcare system, which must focus on patient and emphasize mainly prevention, not only treatment. In this context, and with the wide availability of mobile technology, we here propose a patient monitoring system based on wearable sensors, and connected to a medical datacenter through a mobile device. Patients with bipolar disorder can benefit from this remote monitoring system, as warning signs can be detected early, preventing a hospitalization. Studies have reported that great part of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder do not report recognizing any early warning signs. Thus, to prevent relapses, in our system, predictive information associated with warning signs are sent to the patient's doctor. This paper proposes a continuous monitoring system of the patients movement amount, including quality of sleep, through a system composed of wearable device, patient's smartphone and a web application.",

abstract = "Objective
To map the health effects of interventions which aim to alter the psychosocial work environment, with a particular focus on differential impacts by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, or age.
Methods
A systematic approach was used to identify, appraise and summarise existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) that examined the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work environment. Electronic databases, websites, and bibliographies, were searched from 2000–2007. Experts were also contacted. Identified reviews were critically appraised and the results summarised taking into account methodological quality. The review was conducted in the UK between October 2006 and December 2007.
Results
Seven systematic reviews were identified. Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health. Importantly, five reviews suggested that organisational level psychosocial workplace interventions may have the potential to reduce health inequalities amongst employees.
Conclusion
Policy makers should consider organisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment when seeking to improve the health of the working age population.",

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in the ageing population. The estimated Indian population, who would be affected by osteoporosis by 2015, would be 25 million. This would be associated with enormous costs and considerable consumption of health resources. Hence prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is of paramount importance. The existing drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are limited in scope, tolerability and antifracture efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the existing drugs and to develop newer ones. Long acting bisphosphonates, SERMs with less non-skeletal adverse effects and PTH are definitely milestone developments. Newer osteoclast targeted agents like inhibitors of RANK pathway; cathepsin K; c-src kinase; and integrins are under clinical development. Osteoblast targeted therapies include the agents acting through the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway like sclerostin antagonists and Dkk-1 inhibitors. The molecular targets and the emerging drugs for treatment of osteoporosis are discussed.",

Although physical activity has been shown to play a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, much less is known about the relationship between physical activity and multimorbidity. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and multimorbidity in male and female adults after adjusting for key demographic, geographical, and lifestyle factors. The study drew data from a prospective cohort in Atlantic Canada (2009–2015). The sample included 18,709 participants between the ages of 35–69. Eighteen chronic diseases were identified. Physical activity levels were estimated based on the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that multimorbid individuals were significantly more likely to be physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.10, 1.44) after adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Additional stratified analyses suggest that the magnitude of the effect between multimorbidity and physical activity was stronger for men (OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.12, 1.79) than women (OR=1.18; CI 1.00, 1.39) and those living in rural (OR=1.43; CI 1.10, 1.85) versus urban (OR=1.20; CI 1.02, 141) areas. Given the generally low levels of physical activity across populations and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity, there is a need for a prospective study to explore causal associations between physical activity, multimorbidity, and health outcomes.",

abstract = "The morbidity and mortality associated with fractures due to osteoporosis or “porous bone” contributes significantly to global healthcare costs and will increase exponentially with ageing populations. In menopausal women, the onset of menopause and rapid estrogen withdrawal leads to osteoporotic fractures. Healthy bone requires the coordinated remodeling function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the basic bone multicellular unit, regulated by estrogen, RANKL/OPG, ROS, growth factors, and other kinase signaling pathways. Anti-osteoporotic drugs in current use such as hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and bisphosphonates are designed to target these pathways, but all have their limitations. Extracts of the dried aerial parts of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Epimedium (Berberidaceae) has long been used for bone health. Some nine Epimedium prenylflavonoid compounds have been reported to target estrogen signaling and other bone morphogenesis pathways in mesenchymal stem cell, osteoblast, and osteoclast cell lineages. Epimedium prenylflavonoids and enriched extracts can exert beneficial effects on bone health in estrogen-deficient and other osteoporosis animal models. The development of sensitive and rapid mass chromatographic techniques to quantify compounds extracted from Epimedium, including icariin and icaritin, has been used to standardize production and to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Epimedium in animal models and humans. Recent clinical trials have reported positive effects on bone health, suggesting that compounds or extracts of Epimedium have the potential to be developed as agents, alone or in combination with other drugs, to prevent or delay the onset of osteoporosis and reduce the risk of hip fractures.",

abstract = "Objectives
Since the ageing population demands a response to ensure older people remain healthy and active, we studied the dynamics of a recently proposed healthy ageing phenotype. We drew the phenotype’s trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.
Design and outcomes
The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype’s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.
Results
Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by −0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.352, −0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by −0.293 (CI: −0.403, −0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.
Conclusion
Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

abstract = "Background
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was established to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally the health of the work force.
Methods
From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7-day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff.
Results
By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42,112 participants, of whom 35,199 (83.6%) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71% of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).
Conclusion
The Airwave Health Monitoring Study is the only large-scale cohort study of police employees worldwide. The specificities of this sample, such as its well-defined job hierarchy, make it a particularly valuable occupational cohort. Participants have consented to the use of their data and samples for future, currently unspecified, research purposes.",

abstract = "Objective
Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to the project temperature-related burden of cardiovascular diseases using years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical subtropical climate.
Methods
A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
Results
The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual increase in heat-related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August. Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1–11.5 times for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering demographic changes, even with 30% adaptation taken into consideration.
Conclusions
Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future, heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The study uses primary data collected from 40 relocated households and compares them with 61 non-relocated households currently residing inside the core zone of STR. The study finds that the average share of income from agriculture, livestock and non-timber forest products are relatively higher in case of households residing inside the core area. Conversely, income derived from non-agricultural wage labour contributes maximum to the total income of the relocated households. Although access to educational facilities, transport and health care are reported to be some of the immediate benefits after relocation, food security of the displaced households is found to be adversely affected due to reduced crop diversity and output. The econometric results find that the working-age population and the literates in the region are more willing to relocate from the reserve. Particularly, the male members in the community are more desirous of participating in the relocation process and reaping the associated benefits as opposed to their female counterparts. The study gainsays the existing conservation paradigm via relocation and suggests that participatory capacity building of the affected community alongside consultation with all the stakeholders can go a long way in achieving the twin objectives of biodiversity conservation and local livelihood promotion.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify recommendations for determining patient panel/caseload size for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings.
Design
Scoping review of the international published and grey literature.
Data sources
The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data.
Results
We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9–15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores.
Discussion
The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size.
Conclusion
There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size. Decisions about panel/caseload size must take into account the effects of nurse practitioner activities on outcomes of care.",

abstract = "Background
With an ageing population the prevalence of burns in the elderly is increasing. The influence of increasing age on post-burn quality of life (QoL) is unquantified.
Aim
To examine the effect of ageing on QoL recovery after burn.
Methods
The Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) and Short Form Health Outcomes (SF-36), collected up to 24 months post-injury, for patients treated by the Royal Perth Hospital Burn Service were analysed. Multivariable analysis was adjusted for demographic and injury factors. The impact of ageing on rate of recovery was examined using BSHS-B normative data.
Results
The cohort (n=1051) was 79.6% male with mean TBSA of 8% and age of 37.3 years. The SF-36 showed advancing age predicted poorer outcomes in physical function, role physical, vitality and role emotional domains but reduced bodily pain. The BSHS-B was affected by injury factors, not ageing. The standardised rate of recovery after burn improved with advancing age. The provision of surgery positively affected most outcomes assessed.
Conclusion
This study quantified the impact of ageing on post-burn QoL recovery and confirmed that physical function suffered to the greatest degree. The results emphasise the importance of pro-active burn surgery and physical rehabilitation strategies with older patients.",

This progress, along with advances in biotechnology, has rendered possible the development of ever more sophisticated treatments employing novel mechanisms of action. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, approved for the treatment of postmenopausal and male osteoporosis, significantly and continuously increases bone mineral density (BMD) and maintains a low risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures for up to 8years. Currently available combinations of estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators moderately increase BMD without causing the extra-skeletal adverse effects of each compound alone. The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has recently been shown to decrease vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fracture rates and is nearing approval. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. Several other agents are currently in earlier clinical and preclinical phases of development, including dickkopf-1 antagonists, activin A antagonists, β-arrestin analogs, calcilytics, and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

abstract = "Objectives
An ageing population requires governments to keep older people working longer and delay early retirement. This paper investigates the extent to which common health problems and geographical location are associated with full and partial early retirement among mature-age Australians.
Study design
Cross sectional.
Methods
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of self-reported data of 21,719 women and 16,393 men from the 45 and Up Study. Outcome measure: retirement status.
Results
Women who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, osteoporosis, thrombosis, or anxiety were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had depression, breast cancer or osteoarthritis were more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had cancer, heart disease, anxiety or depression were more likely to be fully or partially retired due to ill-health than those without these health problems. Men who reported having had a stroke, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health compared to those without these health problems. Men and women living outside major cities were more likely to be fully retired due to ill-health. Men from outer regional areas were also more likely to be partially retired due to ill-health.
Conclusions
To reduce early retirement due to ill-health, health practitioners, governments and employers should address targeted health problems, particularly in areas outside capital cities.",

In this context, health professionals play an important role in identifying impaired drivers. This situation is complicated for two reasons: discussion of driving cessation is a sensitive topic for both health professionals and the elderly, and physicians have limited familiarity with the current American Medical Association (AMA) screening guidelines or mandated reporting laws. To assess curriculum that trains health professionals to increase their awareness, screening, management, and reporting of age-related driving impairments. Between 2009 and September 2011, 47 trainings were delivered to 1202 health professionals. The majority of trainings were seminars or lectures lasting 1h; all were conducted in southern California. The training curriculum was divided into four sections: introduction and background; screening and interpretation; managing outcomes and reporting; and referrals and resources. Videos addressed broaching the topic with patients and counseling on driving cessation. The curriculum was delivered by physicians with the support of public health-trained program staff. Pre- and post-testing was done with 641 of the participants; the majority were physicians. Post-training, participants’ confidence in ability to screen increased to 72% and intent to screen increased to 55%. Fully 92% stated they had developed a better understanding of California's mandated reporting laws. Similarly, 92% said they had developed a better understanding of the medical conditions and medications that may impair older adults’ ability to drive safely. Furthermore, 91% said mandated-reporting laws helped protect the safety of patients and others, and 59% said it was easier to discuss and justify driving cessation with patients. In-person training of health professionals on age-related driving impairments was well received and resulted in increased self-reported knowledge, confidence to screen, and intent to screen. Physicians were supportive of mandatory reporting laws.",

Dementia has been established as one of the major challenges of society. Dementia places an increasing burden on caregivers, and on health care and social welfare. The purpose was to determine the prevalence of dementia syndrome in an ageing rural population, and on the grounds of the results to discuss the development of the prevalence taking into consideration population ageing.
Population and method
A total population based clinico-epidemiological study was carried out covering all of the 1680 inhabitants aged 60+ in the rural municipality of Haapajärvi in Northern Finland. Registers of health and social welfare, and population interviews using Mini Mental State Examination followed by clinical examinations for those scoring less than 25 points, were used for screening and diagnosing dementia, which was made according to the DSM-IV criteria.
Results
Among all eligible subjects, 70.8% were participating in the study. The prevalence of dementia was 8.8% in a total population aged 60+. The prevalence was associated with advanced age giving the prevalence-rate of 43.8% among the people aged 90+.
Discussion
The systematic auditing for dementia among the total population of people aged 60+ discovered new cases yielding higher prevalence numbers than found earlier in Finnish or in European studies.
Conclusion
The results refer to the fact that active measures are needed in order to improve the access to diagnostics and care for the demented. Assuming no changes in mortality, and that no effective prevention strategies or curative treatment take place, the number of demented persons in the study area will increase due to the population development by 39% by the year 2020, and by 90% by the year 2030.",

abstract = "Objective
Olive oil is the main fat source in the Mediterranean diet and shows a protective role against aging and related diseases. Osteoporosis represents a serious health problem worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for fractures and mortality. Nutrition should be part of bone disease prevention strategies, especially in light of the aging population and the effect of diet on bone health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral supplementation with extra virgin olive oil (VOO) enriched with vitamins D3, K1, and B6 (VitVOO) is able to modify some physicochemical and functional plasma membrane properties and nitrosative stress markers status.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 postmenopausal women were administered either VitVOO or placebo (PlaVOO). After 1 y of oral supplementation, platelet membrane fluidity changes, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, serum nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite levels were determined in participants.
Results
After 1 y (time 1), women taking VitVOO showed lower nitric oxide levels than those taking PlaVOO; the same trend was found for peroxynitrite levels. As far as membrane fluidity was concerned, a significant decrease in anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene at time 1 in VitVOO participants compared with PlaVOO was found. Finally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed a significant increase after VitVOO supplementation.
Conclusion
The supplementation of VitVOO into the diet of postmenopausal women could represent a proper tool for platelet function and a useful strategy against nitrosative stress and related diseases, thus confirming the antioxidant role played by the added vitamins.",

Despite the success of surgery for hip fractures and the extensive health services utilisation, health outcomes are often poor. Considering the recovery process as multifactorial and intervening to address all relevant factors may improve recovery rates. However, we need first to fully understand the factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures, including psycho-cognitive and social factors. The purpose of this study was to identify future research priorities for understanding the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors in the recovery process for community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture and to survey world experts to confirm the identified priorities.
Methods
This was a two-stage process. First, a workshop of international experts in hip fracture care (researchers and clinician-scientists) was held in 2016 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Using Nominal Group Technique accompanied by Multi-voting Technique, workshop attendees identified the most important future research areas for psycho-cognitive and social factors contributing to recovery after hip fractures. Second, an online survey of the International Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), which includes researchers and clinicians interested in fragility fractures, followed the meeting. The survey respondents reviewed and added to priorities from the first stage and then ranked the top priorities.
Results
Twenty-three experts participated in the meeting (from five countries) and 152 participants (from 29 countries) responded to the survey. Top priorities for the psycho-cognitive domain were preventing and treating in-hospital delirium; comparing the effectiveness of targeted versus multifactorial interventions; studying interactions between psycho-cognitive, social, and environmental factors in the recovery process; and modifying the environment to enhance patients’ cognitive reserves. Top priorities for the social domain were understanding the role of social factors in the recovery process; understanding patients’ perspectives on important social factors; identifying components of social support relevant to recovery; understanding attitudes towards patients with hip fractures among all stakeholders; and understanding the social support needs for caregivers.
Conclusion
A set of future research priorities to understand the role of psycho-cognitive and social factors has been developed and confirmed through a rigorous international decision-making process. These priorities offer valuable guidance for researchers, scientific bodies, and funding agencies.",

With advancing age comes dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, disabilities, and mental problems. This study was conducted to epidemiologically describe the health status of the elderly population of Iran.
Material and Methods
People aged ≥60 were selected. Mini-nutritional assessment, activity of daily living, geriatric depression scale questionnaires were administered. Physical diseases and risk factors were also investigated. For the purpose of this study, 1350 elderly individuals were randomly selected.
Results
The mean age of sample was 69.1±7.3 and 65.9% were illiterate. From total, 727 (53.8%) had vision problems. The most common problem was cataracts with a prevalence of 305 (22.6%) patients who were either suffering from cataracts or had undergone a surgery for it. From 634 individuals who used dentures, 446 (70.3%) wore the same first denture for over 10 years, without being examined. 524 (38.8%) of our seniors spent their free time alone at home. 13.2% of women and 12.6% of men were dependent on others for at least one daily activity. In terms of nutrition, 70 (5.5%) of the elderly (46 women and 24 men) were severely malnourished with 554 (41.3%) (243 men and 311 women) at risk of malnutrition.
Conclusion
The health status of the elderly in Iran was similar to other countries in the world. However there continues to be room for improvement. Taking into account the rapidly aging population of Iran, health providers, and policy makers are required to take steps at a national level and direct more resources into supporting the elderly population.",

abstract = "Like many OECD countries New Zealand has experienced a large increase in the number of working-age people receiving incapacity benefits in the last 3 decades, despite apparent improvements in population health. This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid’s benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25–64 year olds by benefit receipt status. Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2% to 5% of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354/100 000 in the 1981–84 cohort to 1371/100 000 in the 2001–04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954/100 000 to 688/100 000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4.27 to 4.54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid’s benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.",

To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for primary episodes of severe lower leg cellulitis (LLC).
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort study using state-wide data linkage of adults presenting to Western Australian (WA) hospitals with a first ever LLC from January 2002 to December 2013. The study aimed at determining risk factors, medical records from the index patient, together with comparable data from controls matched by age, sex, postcode, and month of admission.
Results
During the period, 36 276 patients presented with their first episode of LLC. The incidence increased by 4.7% per annum, reaching 204.8 (95% CI 198.6–211.1) per 100 000 population by December 2013. Analysis of 29 062 case-control pairs showed several conditions with lower limb pathology were independently associated with LLC, including varicose veins (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 2.50–3.48, p < 0.001), lymphoedema (AOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.71–4.10, p < 0.001), tinea pedis (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.45–6.42, p 0.003), and saphenous vein harvest during coronary artery bypass grafting (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32–2.30, p < 0.001). Also associated with LLC was obesity (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82–2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001), rheumatologic conditions (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72–2.60, p < 0.001), hemiplegia/paraplegia (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13–1.52, p < 0.001), and liver disease (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51–2.06, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
LLC presents a major burden to the health sector and is increasing with an ageing population. Given the high rates of recurrence, long-term morbidity, and economic impact, efforts to reduce primary episodes should be incorporated into the infectious diseases and healthy ageing research agenda.",

abstract = "Background and Objective
Given the phenomenon of aging population, dementias arise as a complex health problem throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing patients with some type of dementia from healthy people. Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family. This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of dementia.
Methods
The experiments were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19 different attributes about patients with cognitive decline reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a text mining process. It was the result of clustering the patient's pathological history information stored in an unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms (naïve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees) were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets: one containing only the original structured data; the other containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
Results
The models’ accuracy metrics obtained from the two different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic prediction for the pathologies of interest.
Conclusions
When analysing the different methods of classification and clustering used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models with support of ensemble methods.",

abstract = "Background
Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing with an aging population and associated increasing comorbidities, and an expected concomitant increase in prescribed non-cardiac medications. The need to comply with clinical practice guidelines for multiple disease states often leads to polypharmacy; which in turn increases risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and nonadherence.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that polypharmacy due to non-HF related medications at discharge (following a HF exacerbation) increases the risk of all cause re-admission.
Methods
This was an a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from two hospitals in the Allegheny Health System, PA with a primary diagnosis of HF from 01/2017-12/2018 with at least 90 days follow-up. The data series were tested for difference in hospital readmission rates for HF at 30 and 90 days against the number of non-HF medications grouped into 8 incremental categories. The chi-square test was used to determine the significance of the observed readmission rates compared to random chance, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
Results
A total of 1367 patients were included in study analysis. There was a statistically significant association between increasing number of non-HF medications and 90 day readmission (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy of non-HF medications results in a consistently linear increases in HF readmission rate, incrementally dependent on the number of prescribed non-HF medications and is significantly associated with 90-day all-cause readmission.",

abstract = "Background
The effects of skeletal muscle mass on depressive symptoms remain poorly understood, especially in the middle-aged population. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms according to sex and menopausal status in the middle-aged Korean population.
Methods
Herein, 1,151 men and 2,176 women aged 30–64 years completed questionnaires and underwent health examinations in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for height squared (ASM/Ht2). Both continuous values and tertile groups of ASM/Ht2 were used for analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory-II (BDI), and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was determined as a BDI score ≥ 20.
Results
Multiple logistic regression analysis using a fully adjusted model showed that depressive symptoms were more frequently observed among men in the lower ASM/Ht2 tertile and middle ASM/Ht2 tertile than among those in the higher ASM/Ht2 tertile. Each 1-kg/m2 decrease in ASM/Ht2 was significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in men. Such significant association was not observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the study design, measurement of skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms only once, estimation of skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis, assessing depressive symptoms by self-reported questionnaire, and potential unknown confounding variables constitute the limitations of our study.
Conclusions
The independent association between low skeletal muscle mass and depressive symptoms was observed in men but not in women.",

Hip fracture risk is high in young people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been examined in an institutionalized aging population with MS.
Objective
We aimed to compare the hip fracture risk in nursing home (NH) residents with and without MS; and (2) examine risk factors for hip fracture in those with MS.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national NH clinical assessment and Medicare claims data. Participants included age-, sex- and race-matched NH residents with/without MS (2007–2008). Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare 2-year hip fracture risk, and to examine risk factors.
Results
A total of 5692 NH residents with MS were matched to 28,460 without MS. Approximately 80% of residents with MS vs. 50% of those without MS required extensive assistance in walking at NH admission. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fracture was 7.1 and 18.6 per 1000 person-years in those with or without MS, respectively. Wandering and anxiolytic exposure were the main hip fracture risk factors in transfer independent residents with MS; while pneumonia and antidepressant use were the main factors in dependent residents with MS.
Conclusions
In contrast to prior comparisons from non-NH populations, the incidence of hip fracture was lower in NH residents with MS as compared with matched controls. Residents with MS were much more functionally dependent, which likely explains these findings. Fracture prevention strategies should focus on fall prevention in independent residents; and possibly improvement of health status and facility quality of care in dependent residents.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of some dento-alveolar features (caries, dental calculus, tooth wear, enamel hypoplasia, abscesses, retraction of the alveolar bone, chipping, and ante mortem tooth loss) on an Iron Age sample from the Etruscan necropolis of Spina (North-Eastern Italy) and to make a relation with dietary evidence found in the archaeological records. These dental features were used to evaluate the oral health status and dietary habits with the aim of shedding light on the lifestyle and living conditions of this population.
Materials and methods
The sample analysed consisted of 680 permanent teeth from 80 burials.
Results
Overall, individuals at Spina exhibited a low incidence of caries, abscesses and ante mortem tooth loss, high calculus rates and severe attrition, suggesting a subsistence pattern based on a mixture of fishing, pastoralism and agriculture. The low incidence of hypoplasia was probably related to their good nutritional conditions and weak metabolic stresses during early childhood.
Conclusions
These findings, quite similar to those of Etruscans from other parts of Italy, are very different from those of other populations living in the same territory during the same time. This pattern is indicative of a general good health status in this Iron Age population and may be related, at least in part, to the Etruscan diet.",

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience lower levels of healthy behaviors as do older persons, making health promotion a key priority for these populations.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to review the two fields of developmental disability and aging health promotion research in order to understand strategies used by both and to identify emerging and innovative practices that disability researchers can learn from each other.
Methods
We conducted scoping reviews of health promotion intervention peer reviewed articles in English from 1991 to 2011 for intellectual and developmental disabilities and from 2007 to 2011 for the more extensive gerontological literature. Two reviewers extracted data.
Results
The disability review identified 34 studies and three main types of interventions: exercise, multi-component, and health screens. The aging review identified 176 articles which had a wider variety of intervention topics and techniques, with more articles including innovative approaches to bringing interventions to community settings across a wider variety of populations.
Conclusions
As people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are living longer, disability health promotion can look to the aging literature for ideas to incorporate in future interventions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the gerontological research can learn from the research in intellectual and developmental disabilities on ways to adapt health promotion interventions to people with cognitive and physical limitations. Use of universal design principles could enable greater inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion interventions for the general aging population.",

Rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide health concern because excess weight gain within populations forecasts an increased burden from several diseases, most notably cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. In this report, we used a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences in the next two decades from a continued rise in obesity in two ageing populations—the USA and the UK. These trends project 65 million more obese adults in the USA and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by 2030, consequently accruing an additional 6–8·5 million cases of diabetes, 5·7–7·3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, 492 000–669 000 additional cases of cancer, and 26–55 million quality-adjusted life years forgone for USA and UK combined. The combined medical costs associated with treatment of these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48–66 billion/year in the USA and by £1·9–2 billion/year in the UK by 2030. Hence, effective policies to promote healthier weight also have economic benefits.",

abstract = "Purpose
To determine the extent to which aspects of public health policy have been incorporated into the antibullying statutes enacted in the United States.
Methods
We reviewed all the state laws dealing with school bullying, harassment, and/or intimidation enacted in the United States as of June 2007. These laws were evaluated using an Antibullying Public Health Policy Criteria Index, designed for the purpose of this study. The criteria included presence of a bullying definition, a prohibition of bullying, a statutory recognition of bullying as a public health threat, and a call for prevention programs. As part of that evaluation, laws were examined to ascertain whether they evidenced essential elements of public health concerns and also the extent to which the U.S. school age population was protected by these laws.
Results
As of June 2007, 35 states have enacted antibullying legislation that aims to protect the safety of 77% of U.S. students enrolled in public schools. However, only 16 of those states have enacted statutes that incorporate comprehensive basic public health antibullying principles.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for implementation of school bullying prevention laws. Such laws should clearly define the problem of bullying in schools and its associated health risks, prohibit bullying, require implementation of prevention programs, provide funding for prevention activities, and confer adequate and appropriate jurisdiction.",

A further challenge is the infertility of the European populations. The consequent burden to our health system means that there has to be a far closer understanding between patients and the pharmaceutical industry about the medicines that are produced, side effects, adverse effects and how necessary it is for these patient reported outcomes to be fed back to the industry. For too long, the industry and patients have been kept apart by clinicians and certainly, in more recent times, by the media. This is having a very adverse effect upon our health economy and should be rectified wherever possible. Partnership and constant dialogue between industry and patients using the well established Dr/Patient relationship is essential for the joint responsibility of managing health.",

The objective of this study was to establish the extent to which frailty was associated with attrition and then compare estimates of frailty prevalence and progression estimated from the observed data to those estimated after imputation.
Design
Population-based cohort study.
Setting
The Health in Men Study (HIMS) with frailty estimated at Wave 2 (2001/2004) and Wave 3 (2008) and mortality follow-up to 2010.
Participants
Participants were 10,305 community-dwelling men aged 70 and older, followed for up to 10 years.
Measurements
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire covering functional activities and illnesses. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL Scale and a 32-item Frailty Index.
Results
Nonresponders at Wave 3 were more likely to have been frail at Wave 2. Imputed estimates of frailty prevalence were 8% to 10% higher than those derived from the observed data.
Conclusion
Epidemiological surveys may substantially underestimate the levels of frailty among older people in the general population. This selective nonresponse results in an overoptimistic view of aging populations, particularly for the very old.",

After addressing the methodological challenges of endogeneity and sample attrition due to mortality, and holding an array of demographic, lifestyle, and health variables constant, we find that social exclusion is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment. Rural elderly women suffering from severe or extreme social exclusion are 23 times more likely to be cognitively impaired as compared to their urban male counterparts who are not socially excluded. Lack of participation in social activity is the most common risk factor associated with cognitive impairment across groups, after controlling for relevant covariates.",

New and better instruments will be crucial to assess the disease severity and progression, as well as to improve its treatment, stimulation, and rehabilitation. With the purpose of detecting, assessing and quantifying cognitive impairments like MCI or AD, several methods are employed by clinical experts. Syndrom Kurztest neuropsychological battery (SKT) is a simple and short test to measure cognitive decline as it assesses memory, attention, and related cognitive functions, taking into account the speed of information processing. In this paper, we present a decision system to embed in a robot that can set up a productive interaction with a patient, and can be employed by the caregiver to motivate and support him while performing cognitive exercises as SKT. We propose two different interaction loops. First, the robot interacts with the caregiver in order to set up the mental and physical impairments of the patient and indicate a goal of the exercise. This is used to determine the desired robot behavior (human-centric or robot-centric, and preferred interaction modalities). Second, the robot interacts with the patient and adapts its actions to engage and assist him to complete the exercise. Two batches of experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the robot can take profit of the initial interaction with the caregiver to provide a quicker personalization, and also it can adapt to different user responses and provide support and assistance at different levels of interaction.",

With the rapid growth in the aging population in Hong Kong, it is foreseeable that every flat unit will accommodate one senior citizen. To address this looming problem, the Hong Kong Government has introduced several aged friendly home design elements and care facilities to redeveloped public rental housing estates. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the “aging in place” philosophy, through evaluating the applicability and effectiveness of those facilities. A redevelopment project, the Un Chau Estate in Hong Kong was selected as a case study. Ecological theory is applied to evaluate the case study at micro, meso and macro scales. The methodological approaches include (a) a questionnaire survey, (b) face-to-face group discussions and (c) in-depth interviews. Results reveal that senior satisfaction levels with the new elements investigated were below the levels of perceived importance. In particular, the seniors emphasized the lack of a sense of home and privacy in their residences. They were, however, moderately satisfied with the independence and dignity and comfort and health elements. The results also reveal that the provision of common facilities is not up to standard in meeting the needs of the elderly. The majority of the elderly consistently opined that aging in place is their priority. To some extent, the extreme case of Hong Kong as a showcase of a dense populated aged Asian city, sheds light on how public housing (re)development can be designed to facilitate aging in place. A more comprehensive and refined approach at micro, meso, and macro scales is necessary to guarantee the satisfactory implementation of aging in place.",

abstract = "In South Korea, lumbar intervertebral disc disorder (LIDD) patients are increasing in all age groups due to an aging population and changes in lifestyle, like sedentary, and there has been concern about reducing quality of care and increasing healthcare expenditure. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of hospital volume and hospital staffing, such as neurosurgeon or nurse, for length of stay or readmission in LIDD inpatients. We used health insurance claim data from 157 hospitals, consisting of 88,949 inpatient cases during 2010–2013. Multi-level models were analyzed to examine the association between LOS/readmission and both inpatient and hospital level variables. By the results, the average LOS was 10.85 days, and readmission within 30 days after discharge was 1063 (1.2%) cases. Higher hospital volume or number of neurosurgeons/ doctors showed inverse relation with LOS (per increases 100 cases=β: −0.0457, P-value<0.0001; per increases 1 neurosurgeon=β: −0.3517, P-value<0.0001; number of doctors per 100 beds=β: −0.1200, P-value<0.0001). And, higher number of registered nurses (RNs) showed inverse relation with early readmission. In conclusion, higher volume or staffing showed positive relation with improving efficiency and quality in care of LIDD. Therefore, health policy makers should consider providing incentives or motivation to hospitals with higher volume or more superior hospital staffing for effective management of excessive healthcare expenditure or reducing quality of care.",

abstract = "Objective
As the proportion of the aging population rises dramatically, osteoporotic fractures among the elderly have become a global health concern. We assessed the prevalence of osteoporosis and estimated the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures among postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods
Patients who were undergoing a checkup at a teaching hospital in eastern Taiwan were invited to participate in this study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to ascertain their demographics, diet, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1–L4) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The 10-year probability of osteoporotic fracture was computed online without BMD data with the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). Results: In total, 475 postmenopausal women were involved in this study. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 37.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 33.2%, 41.5%]. The mean 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture were 13.8% (95% CI = 10.7%, 16.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI = 0.8%, 3.5%), respectively. For women aged ≥ 70 years, the mean 10-year probability of an osteoporotic fracture was 24.3% (95% CI = 13.6%, 35.0%). In total, approximately 17.1% (95% CI = 14.0%, 20.5%) of women were at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture (risk > 20%) and 20.3% (95% CI = 16.1%, 23.9%) were at high risk of a hip fracture (> 3%). Furthermore, one in four osteoporotic women was at high risk of a major osteoporotic fracture.
Conclusion
Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture is of great concern particularly among older women and vegetarians. Ongoing studies of fracture rates should be followed up, and strategies and research directed at fracture prevention should be prioritized as the proportion of the aged population increases.",

abstract = "Background
In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, an estimated 5000 people have dementia, 58% of whom have a diagnosis. Owing to a growing and ageing population this number is expected to rise to nearly 7000 by 2025. Dementia is the leading cause of death in Wales for women. A health needs assessment is a systematic method to review health issues leading to agreed priorities that improve health and reduce inequalities. The five steps are scoping, identifying health priorities, identifying priorities for change, communicating, and monitoring. The health needs assessment included a review of the literature, review of quantitative data, and a qualitative study. Here I describe the qualitative study.
Methods
Interviews were done with 27 carers, staff, and stakeholders; and a focus group of people with dementia was undertaken. Participants were identified with a snowball technique. A list of questions was agreed by a steering group to uncover unmet health needs. This list was used as a guide in all interviews and the focus group, all of which were audio recorded. A thematic review of the interviews and focus group was undertaken.
Findings
Data saturation was reached before completion of the interviews. Nine themes were identified from the data: isolation and loneliness (transport was an issue, with most people with dementia unable to drive); kindness and compassion (paid staff need further training); coordination of services (needs further attention); caring for carers (has a direct impact on quality of life for people with dementia who have carers); what to do in a crisis (information and timely support is needed); primary care (where support should be offered); inequity in access (was describe); dementia is everyone's business (the society and environment we live in are important); and prevention (there is limited knowledge of the six steps to reduce the risk of dementia).
Interpretation
Inequity in access to services was apparent and needs addressing. Education on risk factors for dementia is needed. A focus on increasing diagnosis rates to ensure that people are offered medication, support, and care is necessary. Carers need timely support, specifically at times of crisis. The study has limited generalisability.

Despite this long-standing interest, a consensus definition has proven to be a difficult task, due to the inherent challenge involved in defining such a complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon. The lack of a clear set of defining characteristics for the construct of successful aging has made comparison of findings across studies difficult and has limited advances in aging research. A consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.",

Empty-nest elders have considerable needs for daily living, health care, and social support in China. The growing need for care of an aging population requires to be met through adequate policy decision making by government.
Aim
To explore care needs of Chinese empty-nest elderly people and to provide reference information for relevant authorities in making care-supporting policies.
Method
A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty-five senior citizens in urban communities who were not living with their children were recruited from three communities in different districts of Beijing. In-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire were used to collect data. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze data.
Results
A major care need by the empty-nest elderly was home-based care. In view of their physical condition, need of support and their own security problems, they would like to have aging-in-place, home-based care by housemaid employment, or have institutionalized care in the future. However, they had some concerns about institutionalized care.
Conclusions
A combination of home-based and community-based care is a suitable mode of care for the empty-nest elderly, and institutionalized care is an expected supplementary form of care.",

Background
Depression is a significant global health burden among the aging population. The strength and relative importance of some known or potential factors associated with geriatric depression (GD) can vary with different regions and populations. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and risk factors of depression for the elderly cadres in the city of Fuzhou, China.
Methods
A total of 1910 community-dwelling elderly cadres aged ≥ 60 years have enrolled in this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, and the factors associated with the depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
Results
The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.5%, of which 10.6% was in men and 9.8% was in women. The highest risk factors were lack of social engagement, low family support, chronic disease, and disturbed sleep.
Conclusion
Depression is common among Chinese elderly cadres. Our results confirmed that late-life depression remains complex, and lack of social engagement and low family support were associated with increased risk of GD.",

abstract = "Purpose
Given the rapid increase in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, there is a growing demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes.
Methods
The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate.
Results
Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described.
Conclusion
The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.",

Background & aims
Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.
Methods
A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.
Results
Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.
Conclusion
There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

abstract = "Background
With an aging population, medical expenses for elderly patients are increasing rapidly. Frailty is currently considered an important issue in geriatrics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of frailty on medical expenses in elderly Korean patients.
Material and methods
Data were gathered from the 2008 and 2011 living profiles of older people surveys (from August 11, 2008 to February 20, 2012) and included 5303 community-living Korean men and women, aged 65 years or older. The five-item frailty index was comprised of items on weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Frailty data were extracted from the 2008 living profiles of older people survey, and out-of-pocket medical expenses data were extracted from the 2011 living profiles of older people survey. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the correlation between frailty and medical expenses after adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status factors.
Results
Baseline frailty assessments grouped patients as robust (43.3%), prefrail (49.3%), and frail (7.4%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and health status variables, frailty was found to increase out-of-pocket medical expenses (robust: ref., prefrail: β=0.087 and P<0.001, frail: β=0.143 and P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that frailty is an independent predictor of increasing medical expenses in community-dwelling elderly patients.",

abstract = "Background
Recent epidemiological research has shown that exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a reduction in cognitive function in older adults. However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
Objectives
To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
Methods
Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
Results
In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = −0.72, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
Conclusions
This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",

In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark.
Methods
All Danish adults aged 18–54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at ≤1 and ≤5years from diagnosis with diabetes.
Results
35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At ≤1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At ≤5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata.
Conclusion
Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",

abstract = "Background
Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.
Methods
Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.
Results
Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.
Conclusion
The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

This pressure can be alleviated by focusing on community-based healthcare and empowering people to proactively manage their own general wellness. To this end, many employee wellness programmes have been launched, as have many technologies to measure specific aspects of wellness. However, wellness is a poorly understood concept and effective wellness-management is elusive and lacking in metrics. In light of this deficit, this research-in-progress draws on activity theory and attribute substitution theory to propose a preliminary model describing how wellness is managed by various actors (e.g. the individual, family carers, healthcare professionals) in the collaborative wellness management activity. The study's empirical data gathering reveals that wellness management is often inhibited because of an inability of these actors to access and reflect on the contextual factors that mediate the activity of managing wellness (i.e. the rules that guide them, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the tools that are utilised in managing wellness).",

Key aspects of recruitment, training, and retention of home care workers are discussed, including those who provide basic support for activities of daily living as well as a variety of skilled professionals: therapists, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. Although the geriatric workforce shortage affects all care settings, it is especially critical in home health care, in part because we are starting with far too few clinicians to meet the medical needs of homebound elderly. A combination of actions is needed, including educational programs, such as those developed by the American Academy of Home Care Physicians (AAHCP), changes in financial incentives, and changes in the culture and practice of health care, to make the home the primary focus of care for these vulnerable, underserved individuals rather than an afterthought.",

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20–59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle- to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.",

abstract = "Background
School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs are a promising strategy for increasing vaccination coverage among schoolchildren. However, questions of economic sustainability have dampened enthusiasm for this approach in the United States. We evaluated SLIV sustainability of a health department led, county-wide SLIV program in Alachua County, Florida. Based on Alachua's outcome data, we modeled the sustainability of SLIV programs statewide using two different implementation costs and at different vaccination rates, reimbursement amount, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage.
Methods
Mass vaccination clinics were conducted at 69 Alachua County schools in 2013 using VFC (for Medicaid and uninsured children) and non-VFC vaccines. Claims were processed after each clinic and submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement ($5 Medicaid and $47.04 from private insurers). We collected programmatic expenditures and volunteer hours to calculate fixed and variable costs for two different implementation costs (with or without in-kind costs included). We project program sustainability for Florida using publicly available county-specific student populations and health insurance enrollment data.
Results
Approximately 42% (n=12,853) of pre-kindergarten – 12th grade students participated in the SLIV program in Alachua. Of the 13,815 doses provided, 58% (8042) were non-VFC vaccine. Total implementation cost was $14.95/dose or $7.93/dose if “in-kind” costs were not included. The program generated a net surplus of $24,221, despite losing $4.68 on every VFC dose provided to Medicaid and uninsured children. With volunteers, 99% of Florida counties would be sustainable at a 50% vaccination rate and average reimbursement amount of $3.25 VFC and $37 non-VFC. Without volunteers, 69% of counties would be sustainable at 50% vaccination rate if all VFC recipients were on Medicaid and its reimbursement increased from $5 to $10 (amount private practices receive).
Conclusions and relevance
Key factors that contributed to the sustainability and success of an SLIV program are: targeting privately insured children and reducing administration cost through volunteers. Counties with a high proportion of VFC eligible children may not be sustainable without subsidies at $5 Medicaid reimbursement.",

To study the onset and compare risk factors for pure depression (DEP), pure anxiety (ANX), and comorbid anxiety-depression (ANXDEP) in the aging population.
Design:
Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period.
Setting:
Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55–85 years at baseline).
Participants:
Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712).
Measurements:
Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ≥16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ≥7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses.
Results:
Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8%) developed DEP, 93 (5.4%) ANX, and 103 (6.0%) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner.
Conclusion:
Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",

After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household’s demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing.",
