abstract = "One of the most critical issues in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is the design of systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and health conditions change. Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

abstract = "Managing prosumers participation in energy trading becomes complicated, as the number of prosumers in smart grid is expected to rise. In this situation, it is safe to group active prosumers into groups or coalitions. By utilising analytical tools, like game theory, the method for grouping or coalition formation of prosumers can be carefully studied. After analysing prosumers behaviour in energy profile, we propose a novel dynamic, decentralised prosumer coalition formation method based on game theory that can satisfy utility grid demands. A conceptual framework is developed for coalition formation and energy management among prosumers in a dynamic environment. This approach has the potential to increase the size and number of coalitions without a central controller to better manage renewable energy usage and trading with energy buyers. We validate the performance of adopting a game theoretic approach, assessing the strategy using open and shared data sources.",

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for explaining this type of expertise. The components of the framework are applied to each phase of the design process and used to provide guidelines for the level of expertise developers might strive to obtain. Several representative systems are analyzed, based on the framework, to explore the degree to which expertise is being captured.

In spite of the availability of authentic research studies of smart wearables, there is still a lack of systematic review on the different aspects of smart wearables concept to find the current state of research, particularly from the perspective of IS field. Therefore, the predominant aim of this research is to review smart wearables literature, recent advances, and future challenges. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was conducted to explore smart wearables by reviewing previous studies from 2010 to 2019. For covering all related papers during these years, an integrated review protocol consisting of automatic and manual stages was pursued. 244 papers were identified to address smart wearables issues and challenges. According to the findings, it is observed that smart wearable studies have increased dramatically during the last years. Moreover, the results show that current studies covered different research themes which are related to smart wearables area, particularly user behavior, technology-focused, security and privacy, design, and social acceptability. Furthermore, based on the results of the weight analysis technique, perceived usefulness, attitude toward technology, social influence, and privacy concerns are identified as the best predictors of smart wearables adoption. Additionally, the results show that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the most commonly adopted theory in the smart wearable studies. The findings of this review would assist academics to realize the existing limitations and gaps as well as the future works for smart wearables research studies.",

COMFIT is composed of two different modules: (1) the App Development Module, a model-driven architecture (MDA) infrastructure, and (2) the App Management and Execution Module, a module that contains cloud-based web interface connected to a server hosted in the cloud with compilers and simulators for developing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The App Development Module allows the developers to design IoT applications using high abstraction artifacts (models), which are tailored to either the application perspective or the network perspective, thus creating a separation between these two concerns. As models can be automatically transformed into code through the App Development Module, COMFIT creates an environment where there is no need of additional configurations to properly compile or simulate the generated code, integrating the development lifecycle of IoT applications into a single environment partially hosted in the client side and partially in the cloud. In its current version, COMFIT supports two operating systems, namely Contiki and TinyOS, which are widely used in IoT devices. COMFIT supports automatic code generation, execution of simulations, and code compilation of applications for these platforms with low development effort. Finally, COMFIT is able to interact with IoT-lab, an open testbed for IoT applications, which allows the developers to test their applications with different configurations without the need of using local IoT devices. Several evaluations were performed to assess COMFIT’s key features in terms of development effort, quality of generated code, and scalability.",

abstract = "The goal of radically increasing renewable energies pushes the current power grid to its limits. Smart technologies on the demand side are keys to cope with fluctuating inputs from distributed generation. At the same time, smart technologies are expected to enhance sustainable consumption by effectively reducing power consumption and its environmental impact. The number of applications is increasing along with more computation, communication, and intelligent capabilities. However, it is unclear how smart technologies resonate with lifestyles and consumption patterns to effectively achieve sustainable consumption. Utilizing the typology method, this paper aims in a first part at a description, an explanation and a framework of different types of sustainable consumption. In the second part, a systematic literature analysis of smart technologies for sustainable consumption is carried out. After analyzing seven current practical approaches, we describe four types of sustainable consumption. We apply the approaches via the housing field of consumption to the smart grid, highlighting the importance of technology adoption. The typology framework can be used for consumer communication, producer guidelines and policy practice.",

abstract = "A system, the aim of which is information retrieval, can be called an information retrieval system or in short information system. Any information system has three main components—Input unit, Processor, and Output unit. An information system may not always be bibliographic or textual. There can also be nonbibliographic or nontextual information systems. Again all bibliographic or textual information systems may not always be sponsored or maintained by libraries or information centers. An information system or network may be either subject-oriented or mission oriented. In a subject-oriented system, the orientation may be either toward science and technology covering physical sciences, life science, technology and interdisciplinary areas, or toward socioeconomic field covering behavioral sciences; and interdisciplinary areas; while in a mission-oriented system, the orientation may be toward public services, resources, production, or management. There may be two types of information system—centralized information center and collaborative/cooperative information system. Some well-known information systems at the international level are MEDLARS, OCLC, INIS, AGRIS, DEVSIS, etc., while those at the national level are ENVIS, BTISnet, INFLIBNET, etc. The structures and functions of these systems/networks have been described in this chapter.",

abstract = "Today, a paradigm shift is being observed in science, where the focus is gradually shifting away from operation to data, which is greatly influencing the decision making also. The data is being inundated proactively from several sources in various forms; especially social media and in modern data science vocabulary is being recognized as Big Data. Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the growing role of cloud computing in Big Data ecosystem. Also, we propose a novel XCLOUDX {XCloudX, X…X}classification to zoom in to gauge the intuitiveness of the scientific name of the cloud-assisted NoSQL Big Data models and analyze whether XCloudX always uses cloud computing underneath or vice versa. XCloudX symbolizes those NoSQL Big Data models that embody the term “cloud” in their name, where X is any alphanumeric variable. The discussion is strengthen by a set of important case studies. Furthermore, we study the emergence of as-a-Service era, motivated by cloud computing drive and explore the new members beyond traditional cloud computing stack, developed in the past couple of years.",
