abstract = "In general, a system may be subject to a combination of functional requirements (FRs) that dictate behavior and non-functional requirements (NFRs) that characterize how FRs are to be satisfied. NFRs also introduce cross-cutting concerns that may be difficult to predict, where the degree of satisfaction (i.e., satisficement) of one NFR may be impacted by the satisficement of one or more FRs/NFRs. In particular, self-adaptive systems (SASs) can modify system configurations or behaviors at run time to continuously satisfy FRs and NFRs. This paper presents Providentia, a search-based technique to optimize the satisficement of NFRs in an SAS experiencing various sources of uncertainty. Providentia explores different combinations of weighted FRs to maximize NFR/FR satisficement. Experimental results suggest that Providentia-optimized goal models significantly improve the satisficement of an SAS when compared with manually- and randomly-generated weights and subgoals. Additionally, we apply a hyper-heuristic (Providentia-SAW) to balance the contribution of NFRs, FRs, and the number of adaptations and further improve the Providentia technique. We apply Providentia and Providentia-SAW to two case studies in different application domains involving a remote data mirroring network and a robotic vacuum controller, respectively.",

The topic of system adaptivity has been widely studied since the mid-60s and, over the past decade, several application areas and technologies relating to self-adaptivity have assumed greater importance. In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations. Moreover, various methods and techniques currently applied in the design of self-adaptive systems are analyzed, as well as some European research initiatives and projects. Finally, the main bottlenecks for the effective application of self-adaptive technology, as well as a set of key research issues on this topic, are precisely identified, in order to overcome current constraints on the effective application of self-adaptivity in its emerging areas of application.",

Subsets of these resources can work together to create new self-regulating IoT applications such as smart health, smart communities and smart homes. However, several challenging issues need to be addressed before this vision of applications based on IoT concepts becomes a reality. Because many IoT applications will be distributed over a large number of interacting devices, centralized control will not be possible and so open problems will need to be solved that relate to building locally operating self-organizing and self-adaptive systems. As an initial step in creating IoT applications with these features, this paper presents a Framework for IoT (FIoT). The approach is based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Machine Learning Techniques, such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. To illustrate the use of FIoT, the paper contains two different IoT applications: (i) Quantified Things and (ii) Smart traffic control. We show how flexible points of our framework are instantiated to generate these IoT application.",

Aerodynamic analysis is carried out using a vortex lattice method, while aircraft component weights are estimated empirically. A new self-adaptive meta-heuristic based on decomposition is specifically developed for this design problem. The new algorithm along with nine established and recently developed multi-objective and many-objective meta-heuristics are employed to solve the problem, while comparative performance is made based upon a hypervolume indicator.

abstract = "Context: Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA) is a fuzzy control-based software self-adaptation paradigm proposed to deal with the fuzzy uncertainty existing in self-adaptive software. However, as many software engineers lack fuzzy control knowledge, it is difficult for them to design and model this kind of fuzzy self-adaptive software (F-SAS). Therefore, efficient and effective modeling technologies and tools are needed for the SFSA framework. Objective: This paper aims to identify modeling requirements of F-SAS and to provide a modeling framework to specify, design and model F-SAS systems. Such a framework can simplify modeling process of F-SAS and improve the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Method: This study proposes a modeling framework called Fuzzy self-Adaptation ModEling (FAME). By extending UML, FAME creates three types of modeling views. An analysis view called Fuzzy Case Diagram is created to specify the fuzzy self-adaptation goal and the realization processes of this goal. A structure view called Fuzzy Class Diagram is created to describe the fuzzy concepts and structural characteristics of F-SAS. A behavior view called Fuzzy Sequence Diagram is created to depict the dynamic behaviors of the F-SAS systems. The framework is implemented as a plug-in of Enterprise Architect. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach by carrying out a subject-based empirical evaluation. The results show that FAME framework can improve modeling quality of F-SAS systems by 44.38% and shorten modeling time of F-SAS systems by 38.41% in comparison with traditional UML. Thus, FAME can considerably ease the modeling process of F-SAS systems. Conclusion: FAME framework incorporates the SFSA concepts into standard UML. Therefore, it provides a direct support to model SFSA characteristics and improves the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Furthermore, it behaves a good example and provides good references for modeling domain-specific software systems.",

Methods for understanding and situating human behavior in the context of development interventions tend to emphasize experimental approaches to objectively isolate key drivers of behavior. However, such methods often do not account for the importance of contextual factors and the wider system. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework to support intervention design that links behavioral insights with service design, a branch of the creative field of design. To develop the framework, we use three case studies conducted in Kenya and Zambia focusing on the uptake of new technologies and services by individuals and households. We demonstrate how the framework can be useful for mapping individuals’ experiences of a new technology or service and, based on this, identify key parameters to support lasting behavior change. The framework reflects how behavior change takes place in the context of complex social-ecological systems – that change over time, and in which a diverse range of actors operate at different levels – with the aim of supporting the design and delivery of more robust development-oriented interventions.",

abstract = "The expansion of cash crops has raised contradicting interests between two bureaucratic bodies (the economy-oriented one that advocates cash crop production and the conservation-oriented one that focuses on natural resources protection) in many places around the world. Recent past has saw growing efforts on the theoretical linkages between cash crop production and conservation, but the solutions to the cash cropping −related land use conflicts remain as violent controversy. Using a geo-simulation approach, this paper models the tea expansion under different policy scenarios and evaluates the effectiveness of these policies in Anji County (China), as a contribution to the scientific basis for formulating sustainable cash cropping practices and alternative land use policies. In particular, a new self-adaptive cellular automaton model based on ensemble learning (EL-CA) is developed and three policy scenarios (economy-over-conservation (EOC), conversion-over-economy (COE), and economy-balance-conservation (EBC)) are set to predict the tea expansion patterns in 2025. Results show that the EL-CA model significantly outperforms the traditional CA models based on empirical statistics. We find that the tea expansion under the EOC scenario is much more intensive than that under the COE and EBC scenarios. The most outstanding ecological consequence of tea expansion is the occupation of forests. Employing an equivalent coefficient approach, we further quantify the trade-offs between economic incomes (from tea expansion) and ecological loss (due to ecosystem service value (ESV) declines) under the three policy scenarios. In the EOC scenario, the loss in ESV far exceeds the benefit of tea expansion. Net change of ESV is higher than that of economic return under the COE. The economic benefit is approximately equal to the ecological loss in the EBC scenario. The EBC should be a socially preferred scenario, since it leads to sustainable tea expansion and minimal ecological impacts. Though the EBC scenario is a desirable choice, how to enforce these policies is an important consideration. Given the complexity in the Chinese policy context, we finally propose several possible measures to promote the coherence of paradoxical policies involving the allocation of land for cash crop cultivation.",

This paper aims to extend the analysis of the effect of institutions on the emergence of biofuel supply chains by developing a conceptual framework that combines elements of complex adaptive systems, (neo) institutional economics and socio-technical systems theory. These elements were formalized into an agent-based model. The proposed method is illustrated by a case study on a biodiesel supply chain in Germany. It was found that the patterns in production capacity result from investors basing their decisions on optimistic perceptions of the market development that increase with a favorable institutional framework. Conversely, patterns in biodiesel production cannot be completely explained by this mechanism. The proposed framework assisted the model conceptualization phase and allowed the incorporation of social structures into the agent-based model. This approach could be developed further to provide insights on the effect of different future deployment strategies on bioenergy systems emergence and development.",

abstract = "Process modeling plays a central role in the development of today’s process-aware information systems both on the management level (e.g., providing input for requirements elicitation and fostering communication) and on the enactment level (providing a blue-print for process execution and enabling simulation). The literature comprises a variety of process modeling approaches proposing different modeling languages (i.e., imperative and declarative languages) and different types of process artifact support (i.e., process models, textual process descriptions, and guided simulations). However, the use of an individual modeling language or a single type of process artifact is usually not enough to provide a clear and concise understanding of the process. To overcome this limitation, a set of so-called “hybrid” approaches combining languages and artifacts have been proposed, but no common grounds have been set to define and categorize them. This work aims at providing a fundamental understanding of these hybrid approaches by defining a unified terminology, providing a conceptual framework and proposing an overarching overview to identify and analyze them. Since no common terminology has been used in the literature, we combined existing concepts and ontologies to define a “Hybrid Business Process Representation” (HBPR). Afterwards, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and investigate the characteristics of HBPRs combining imperative and declarative languages or artifacts. The SLR resulted in 30 articles which were analyzed. The results indicate the presence of two distinct research lines and show common motivations driving the emergence of HBPRs, a limited maturity of existing approaches, and diverse application domains. Moreover, the results are synthesized into a taxonomy classifying different types of representations. Finally, the outcome of the study is used to provide a research agenda delineating the directions for future work.",

Studying fragility in developed cities is a worthwhile undertaking given their economic, social, and political significance. This paper puts forth a conceptual framework to understand the nature of fragile cities in the developed world. Our framework frames fragility as a function of unresolved fractures of social compacts that degrades a city's ability to function over time and stress exacerbates its effects.

abstract = "Pd- or Pt-based precious catalysts (PPC) are considered to be the best candidates toward high performance directly ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) applications, owing to their high intrinsic activity for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). However, the current major barrier for their commercialization is incompletely oxidized intermediates (IOI, such as CO) that poison the catalysts to affect the durability of the cells. Meanwhile, deactivated PPC catalyst is difficult to be recycled, thus impairing the economic benefits for the commercial applications. Moreover, because of the side effects of additive corrosion and aging, the carbon and organic binders widely used in current catalyst design would make the interactions of the IOI more complex to accelerate activity loss. Here, we report a Pd/amorphous SrRuO3 (Pd/a-SrRuO3) hybrid film as a promising material to overcome these problems. Perovskite SrRuO3 can effectively generate oxygen-contains (*OH, *OOH) for intermediates oxidation, providing an ideal platform to promote self-cleaning of CO on Pd activity sites. On the other hand, in analogy to typical self-adapting effect of amorphous catalyst in oxygen reduction reaction process, metastable state of amorphous SrRuO3 in this work is expected to prolong the activity adaptation region at the initial stage of cycling. Furthermore, our conceptual framework of directly depositing Pd/a-SrRuO3 film on operational electrode provides an effective solution to avoid the side effects related with carbon and binders, leading to superior reactivation phenomena with 98% efficiency. As a result, our designed Pd/a-SrRuO3 hybrid film exhibits superior EOR activity (4.0 A mg-1 Pd), durability (i-t, 60,000s), self-adapting region (exceeding 400 cycles with ending activity of 3.0 A mg-1 Pd at 1000th cycle), and also a long-term operation (CP) up to 300,000s with 10 times reactivation. This demonstration of a Pd/Pt-based hybrid catalyst with dual-capability of self-cleaning and self-adapting characteristics is an important step towards the development of highly durable EOR catalysts, with an enormous potential to promote practical application of DEFC.",

We argue that a combination of insights from transition management and transdisciplinary research offers a basis for developing local strategies by which informal institutions can nurture alternative energy policy visions and prescriptions, in order to exploit policy windows that periodically arise. We articulate a conceptual framework to underpin such strategies, which emphasises the role of academics or other knowledge brokers as policy entrepreneurs, helping to build knowledge and capabilities, create networks of social capital and establish alternative discourse coalitions. While our particular applied interest here is in arenas for the development of low carbon energy scenarios in Latin America, the framework is also intended to have wider applicability.",

abstract = "This article proposes a new conceptual framework concerning the implementation of sustainability in supply networks from an innovation perspective. Based upon a recent qualitative literature review in environmental, social/ethical and logistics/operations management journals, this article summarizes and analyses the approaches found. Concluded is that even though innovation, socialization, experimental learning and cultural perspectives have been acknowledged as being relevant to explaining supply network dynamics in general, they are rarely included in the current frameworks concerning sustainability. The question still remains why companies influenced by the same external factors and similar in size and power develop a different strategy towards sustainability aspects in their supply network. The article demonstrates with the first results of a survey held in the fashion/clothing sector the relevance of this question. The proposed conceptual framework states that the capability to develop a strategy is influenced by the innovation power of the “focal” company and its supply network. The three implementation strategies presented in the framework are: resign, offensive and defensive. Two propositions are defined to be tested. These propositions focus on the relation between the level of innovation power and the implementation strategy concerning sustainability. Factors used to characterize the innovation power of the “focal” company are: external orientation and transparency, cooperation between departments, learning and adapting, leadership, autonomy and possibility for experimenting, and result driven. Cooperation in the supply networks is characterized by factors like trust, reputation, joint programmes, and cooperative information systems throughout the supply network. In empirical research, strategies found will be related with the level of innovation power. This level will be measured using the factors mentioned. The results might add a new innovation dimension to an improved conceptual framework within the interdisciplinary field of sustainability and supply network research.",

For firms sourcing globally, tariff introductions or increases significantly affect importing costs, which ultimately affect product costs. Such tariff changes may incentivize firms to adjust their supply base to mitigate these cost increases, thus altering the structure and complexity of firms' supply bases. In this paper, we first characterize the U.S. tariff landscape from 1997 to 2017. We then develop a conceptual model to explain how the severity and timing uncertainty of expected tariff increases influence a firm's speed of adapting to the changing tariff environment. Specifically, we explore firms' propensity to form or delete ties to suppliers, which influences supply base complexity. Moreover, we consider factors that moderate the relationship between severity, timing uncertainty, and supply base complexity, including a tariff's geographical scope, a firm's relative purchase spend, and supply risk. Our conceptual model offers both research and managerial implications.",

Focusing on open government information systems (IS) that provide performance-related data, this paper explores the ongoing tension between government’s goal of transparency and the resulting largely opaque datification effects. Our research insights are derived from an empirical longitudinal study of a controversial open government IS called My School, currently providing performance data on almost 10,000 schools in Australia. We investigate the tension between transparency intended with schools’ open performance data and datification effects they create within the education system and a broader society, through the theoretical lens of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Our study reveals how the tension emerges due to unpredictable use, propagation and reinterpretation of open data by more and more users. Consequently, the original meaning of data gets distorted, as these users continue to reconstruct and reinterpret ‘data’ in their own contexts and adapt their behavior in pursuit of their strategic goals. We also identify and theorize seven datification patterns underlying the tension and the ways they produce various social consequences. Based on these research contributions we discuss important strategic implications for government decision makers and identify new opportunities for future research on open government IS.",

Here, we develop a conceptual framework by combining CAS organisation with landscape structure, functioning and change. The resulting framework, ‘complex adaptive landscapes’ (CAL), explicitly captures the reciprocal feedbacks and non-linear nature of interactions between components within and between system levels, and the consequent possibility of multiple functional states (alternate systems functioning). The CAL framework highlights six core tenets that describe landscape complexity and dynamics. CAL provides examples of how the complex ecohydrological interactions at finer-scale hillslope levels manifest changes to broader landscape levels, as well as multi-temporal feedbacks and change (days to decades). Understanding the specific feedback and non-linear responses of different components of the landscape, such as plant functional types, are of paramount importance for adequately designing monitoring and analytical frameworks for adaptive natural resource management. The CAL framework allows us to better understand the scale of ecohydrological functions within the landscape, and how substituted component types and their spatial and temporal configuration may cause dysfunctional states to arise as a result of human land use.",

abstract = "The aim of this paper is to understand how firms engage in new processes, strategies and behaviors for sustainable innovation. It results on a non-linear, recursive and self-organized process that can be studied as a complex adaptive system. Based on an integrative literature review, we find five ontological sustainable innovation components: operational, collaborative, organizational, instrumental, and holistic. Our analysis also yields three complex adaptive system phenomena, which explain three main patterns of how components interact and interconnect: non-linearity, self-organization and emergence. The three phenomena are mutually dependent and specific to each company. Non-linearity explains the connection between the components, including positive and negative feedback loops and the rates of change, disorder, chaos and stability between them. Self-organization increases the order or regularity between the components interaction and even generates a new order and configuration with the different components behaving autonomously. Emergence involves radically new processes and component interactions due to new and radical experimentation, rule-breaking and disruptive sustainable technologies. Each phenomenon is explained in three extended examples, including three interaction mechanisms describing the dynamics of the five components. The outcomes of this research provide a new approach to theory-building in the sustainable innovation field and serve as the basis for further research on the complexity of engaging sustainable innovation in firms. This suggests new research questions regarding the role of firms in sustainable innovation and sustainable system transitions. It also calls for more interdisciplinary work on the issue due to the systemic nature of sustainable innovation at the firm level.",

It draw upon insights from systems science to examine the relevance and usefulness of the concept of “complex adaptive systems” as a framework to better understand ways in which health promoting school interventions could be introduced and sustained. The primary data for the study were collected by semi-structured interviews with 26 school principals and teachers. Additional information was extracted from publicly available school management plans and annual reports. We examined the data from these sources to determine whether schools exhibit characteristics of complex adaptive systems. The results confirmed that schools do exhibit most, but not all of the characteristics of social complex adaptive systems, and exhibit significant differences with artificial and natural systems. Understanding schools as social complex adaptive systems may help to explain some of the challenges of introducing and sustaining change in schools. These insights may, in turn, lead us to adopt more sophisticated approaches to the diffusion of new programs in school systems that account for the diverse, complex and context specific nature of individual school systems.",

abstract = "Reorganization is an important concept for confronting complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory with ecological reality. However, little work has been done to translate the reorganization idea into a practical conceptual framework. This paper focuses on community-level reorganization, the process of re-forming patterns in relation to the distribution of species density (abundance) and their frequency of occurrence in space (incidence). We assert that changes in species positions in the incidence–abundance (IA) phase plane depict community reorganization in response to environmental changes. This is because species positions in the IA plane represent the most prominent organizational features of a biotic community. We identified four sequential levels of species reorganization in the IA phase plane: reshuffling of species, species appearance, species disappearance and whole-assemblage shift. We propose that the sequential levels represent an increase in reorganization intensity depending on the extent of environmental change. We formulate the Environmental Change and Re-Organization (ECRO) hypothesis specifying that ecosystems respond predictably in terms of community reorganization in the IA phase plane to external drivers. The predictable reorganization follows the four sequential levels of organization in response to intensity of environmental change. We suggest that the response of a species assemblage to external drivers in sequential levels of reorganization is independent of ecosystem properties, type of environmental variables, taxa, and spatio-temporal scales. We tested the predictability of reorganization according to the ECRO hypothesis, using annual plant assemblages of a semiarid shrubland. These assemblages exhibit CAS properties as suggested by Levin: high species diversity, high numbers of individuals, local interactions among individuals in relation to water consumption, and annually selected species subsets for replication. We investigated annual plant assemblage organization and reorganization for 12 years in response to disturbance and resource input, using the IA phase plane. The field study supports our assertion that reorganization of species assemblages in response to environmental change can be represented by species repositioning in the IA phase plane, and that community reorganization follows the four sequential levels of reorganization in response to the intensity of environmental change. Our conceptual framework and experimental studies demonstrate that hypotheses related to core CAS concepts of organization and reorganization can be tested by linking them with community ecology concepts of species patterns in the IA phase plane. We also discuss the relationship between reorganization in the IA phase plane and resilience, regime shift and ecosystem functioning as affected by species response and effects traits.",

The bio-inspired distributed computing paradigm offers benefits such as, self-detection and self-reconfiguration capabilities of the computing systems. The large scale distributed systems suffer from the arbitrary failure of nodes and dynamic formation of network partitions at any point of time. This paper proposes a novel membrane algorithm for self-detection and self-reconfiguration of large distributed systems on the event of arbitrary node failures resulting in network partitioning. The algorithm is distributed in nature and, it is designed based on the hybridization of biological membrane computing model and cell-signaling mechanisms of biological cells. This paper presents the problem definition, design and analysis of the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulation. A detailed comparative analysis of the algorithm with respect to the other contemporary algorithms is presented.",

Studies have focused on isolating entrepreneurial ecosystems' components; however, prior research has not offered a theory of entrepreneurial ecosystems that embraces their complexity. To address this omission in ecosystems research, we contend that entrepreneurial ecosystems can be more fully understood if examined through the lens of complexity science and conceptualized as complex adaptive systems. We contribute to entrepreneurship research by developing a complexity-based definition of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Building on this definition, we connect the research on entrepreneur- and venture-level complexity to work on entrepreneurial ecosystems and propose three related forces that will influence entrepreneurial ecosystem emergence: intentionality of entrepreneurs, coherence of entrepreneurial activities, and injections of resources. Beyond developing theory, we describe how scholars can examine entrepreneurial ecosystems as complex systems using qualitative comparative analysis, agent-based modeling, and interpretivist methods. Our theorizing also has implications for entrepreneurs and policymakers.",

We draw on strategic human resource management (HRM), HRM, and industrial and organizational psychology literatures to develop a conceptual framework for strategic team composition decisions. We describe how organizations use teams to enact their strategy (i.e., fit), and use adaptive teams and networks of teams to achieve fit in a dynamic environment (i.e., flexibility).

The single purpose adaptation approach often fails to address the multiple challenges arises from cascading effects of climate change at different scales and stages. To fill this gap, we developed a multi-dimensional flexible adaptation framework looking at the four dimensions of adaptation, structure, issue, time, and space (SITS). The SITS framework provides a comprehensive approach for cascading adaptation at trans-boundary river basin level and it could effectively enhance the adaptive capacity and transform livelihood outcome if properly implemented. Following the SITS framework, we examined four cascading adaptation pathways for: i) reducing disaster stressors on livelihoods, ii) enhancing access to crucial livelihood capitals, iii) improving equal rights to livelihood, and iv) strengthening synergies and exploiting complementarities at trans-boundary river basin level. The findings revealed that in the context of changing climate, it is necessary to employ different livelihood adaptation strategies and multiple responses simultaneously or sequentially to successfully adapt to the cascading effects of changing climate. The cascading adaptation may provide a sound basis on which to cope with the climate uncertainty through realistic scenarios of structure, issue, time and space. Its implementation, however, has several obstacles, for example, differences in national system, investment capacity, complexity of trans-boundary basin, remained particularly in trans-boundary river basin where managing transnational trade-offs and harness spatial synergies are critically important.",

The objective is gained here by combining two complementary modeling techniques: Model-driven Engineering (MDE) and Formal Methods. Model-driven technique is adopted to design a modeling framework for context-aware systems. Nevertheless, this technique generally lacks formal semantics and it is unfit for model analysis. Therefore, we define a formal semantics to overcome these drawbacks. Moreover, we show how context-aware system’s adaptive behavior can be verified according to their invariants by applying model-checking techniques.",

Even though theory on system innovations and transitions is now extensive, it provided explanations regarding how companies and design and innovation activities fit into the big and long-term picture of system innovations and transitions only to a certain extent. In addition, there have not been many efforts in the design for sustainability field to learn from the theories of transitions and system innovations. In this paper, we make an initial theoretical contribution into the design and innovation for sustainability field by integrating relevant insights from sustainability science and system innovations and transitions theories. The result of this integration is a proposal for a prescriptive conceptual framework which explains how wider-scale systemic changes can be addressed at smaller elements of socio-technical systems specifically focussing on the design and innovation level within companies.",

One of the reasons for the difficulties to close this gap is that for evolving complex systems like natural and socio-economic systems, sustainability cannot be a static objective. Instead sustainable development is an open evolutionary process of improving the management of social–ecological systems, through better understanding and knowledge. Therefore, natural resource management systems need to be able to deal with different temporal, spatial and social scales, nested hierarchies, irreducible uncertainty, multidimensional interactions and emergent properties. The co-evolutionary perspective outlined in this paper serves as heuristic device to map the interactions settled in the networks between the resource base, social institutions and the behaviour of individual actors. For this purpose we draw on ideas from complex adaptive systems theory, evolutionary theory and evolutionary economics. Finally, we outline a research agenda for a co-evolutionary approach for natural resource management systems.",

In particular climate change and the concomitant increase of extreme weather events has exposed the inability of current governance regimes to deal with present and future challenges. Still our knowledge about resource governance regimes and how they change is quite limited. This paper develops a conceptual framework addressing the dynamics and adaptive capacity of resource governance regimes as multi-level learning processes. The influence of formal and informal institutions, the role of state and non-state actors, the nature of multi-level interactions and the relative importance of bureaucratic hierarchies, markets and networks are identified as major structural characteristics of governance regimes. Change is conceptualized as social and societal learning that proceeds in a stepwise fashion moving from single to double to triple loop learning. Informal networks are considered to play a crucial role in such learning processes. The framework supports flexible and context sensitive analysis without being case study specific. First empirical evidence from water governance supports the assumptions made on the dynamics of governance regimes and the usefulness of the chosen approach. More complex and diverse governance regimes have a higher adaptive capacity. However, it is still an open question how to overcome the state of single-loop learning that seem to characterize many attempts to adapt to climate change. Only further development and application of shared conceptual frameworks taking into account the real complexity of governance regimes can generate the knowledge base needed to advance current understanding to a state that allows giving meaningful policy advice.",

We propose here the use of a conceptual guidance tool – the ecological sustainability trigon (EST) – as a means of building and testing environmental management scenarios. Although it requires further testing, the EST allows us to (a) address those three major drivers using human society view as a common currency, and (b) describe our behaviour, energetics (economy) and dynamics through ecological theory.

abstract = "Individual-based models (IBMs) have long been proposed as a key tool for understanding and predicting ecosystem complexities, yet the contribution of this approach to basic or applied ecology has been less than anticipated. Fundamental reasons for the disappointing contribution of IBMs have been, in the current absence of a theoretical foundation for IBMs, conceptual flaws in model formulation and the failure to address critical computer implementation issues. Researchers in the new field of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) study how complex behaviors emerge in systems of relatively simple interacting individuals. Research on CAS, while still new and informal, has identified key concepts for making individual-based systems realistic. I propose that explicit consideration of the following concepts from CAS should make the design of IBMs less ad hoc and more likely to produce models of value for basic and applied ecology: (1) Emergence: what behaviors and population dynamics should emerge from the model's mechanistic representation of key processes vs. being imposed on the model as empirical relations? How should individual traits be modeled so that realistic population responses emerge?; (2) Adaptation: given the model's temporal and spatial scales, what adaptive processes of individuals should be modeled? What mechanisms do individuals use to adapt in response to what environmental forces?; (3) Fitness and strategy: what measures of fitness are appropriate to use as the basis for modelling decision making? Should fitness measures change with life history state?; (4) State-based responses: how should decision processes depend on an individual's state?; (5) Prediction: anticipating decision outcomes appears essential for modelling many behaviors; what are realistic assumptions about how organisms predict the consequences of decisions?; (6) Computer implementation: what user interfaces are necessary to make the model, and especially individual behaviors, observable and testable? How will the model's full design and computer implementation be documented and tested so results are reproducible and valid?",

abstract = "Background
Over the last few decades the food production, distribution and consumption chains have become complex as a result of globalisation and food travelling over large distances. The food supply chain is a multi-layered structure with multiple interactions across and within the hierarchical levels across the entire food system. As unwanted factors and food safety behaviours could lead to global food poisoning catastrophes, it is important to adopt a systems approach to gain a whole-system perspective of the global food system.
Scope and approach
In this review the importance of adopting a complex systems approach towards the global food system and a possible systems analysis method that would help capture this perspective are described. This study emphasizes the importance of adopting a proactive approach, starting with identifying the similarities between the characteristics of complex systems and the food system and the importance and benefits of adopting a whole system approach in the global food system.
Key findings and conclusions
Adopting a complex systems approach to the global food system is of paramount relevance as this would help further understand the interconnectivity of food systems and how multifaceted factors across systemic levels play a major role in achieving food safety. Using a systems analysis model such as the Systems-Theoretic Accident Models and Processes (STAMP) model provides the ability to tackle the limitations of event chain models and analyse the complex interactions among various components in the complex food system. It is the need of the hour to study food systems at micro and macro-levels and develop a model that would have the ability to identify food safety related issues across the global food system.",

An extensive body of knowledge—theory and technique—exists on the “known unknowns,” i.e., uncertainties which can be described probabilistically and addressed through the conventional techniques of risk management. Although some recent studies have addressed projects where the existence of unknown unknowns (unk unks) is readily apparent or may be assumed given the type of project—e.g., new product development or new process implementation—very little work has been reported with respect to projects in general on how a project manager might assess its vulnerability to unk unks. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework to deal with (i.e., recognize and reduce) knowable unk unks in project management. The framework is supported by insights from a variety of theories, case analyses, and experiences. In this framework, we first present a model of the key factors—relating to both project design and behavioral issues—that increase the likelihood of unk unks and a set of propositions linking these factors to unk unks. We then present a set of design and behavioral approaches that project managers could adopt to reduce knowable unk unks. Our framework fills a gap in the project management literature and makes a significant practical contribution: it helps project managers diagnose a project to recognize and reduce the likelihood of unk unks and thus deal more effectively with the otherwise unrecognized risks and opportunities.",

The correlation analysis between urban economy and pollution transfer among cities in river basins has become one of highlights in current researches. Based on the Netlogo software platform, this paper establishes a correlation model among cities in the same river basin from the point of view of multi-agent simulation. Moreover, it assesses the relationship between urban economic development and pollution transfer from three aspects: network concentration; network size; link intensity. The influence of network concentration and link intensity on the total economic size and pollution transfer of the entire river basin is similar. In parallel, the influence of network size on the two modelled variables shows an opposite trend, demonstrating that network size has a greater impact on the city. By comparing the trend of economic size and pollution transfer with the change of network concentration in the context of different economic transfer thresholds, results demonstrate that, with the increase of network concentration, the influence becomes more pronounced. Appropriate error analysis was used to validate the simulation results. In particular, according to it, the error between 10-time and 20-time steps simulation is less than 10%. Consequently, the simulation results are valid. This paper, deepening the research on the correlation among river basin cities, lays the foundation for further research on the directional transmission of the economy and pollution.",

The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a tool to objectify the functioning of healthcare teams operating in the complexity zone, and to evaluate its usefulness in identifying areas for team quality improvement.
Methods
We distributed The Complex Adaptive Leadership (CAL™) Organisational Capability Questionnaire (OCQ) to all members of one palliative care team (n=15) and to palliative care physicians in Flanders, Belgium (n=15). Group discussions were held on feasibility aspects and on the low scoring topics. Data was analysed calculating descriptive statistics (sum score, mean and standard deviation). The one sample T-Test was used to detect differences within each group.
Results
Both groups of participants reached mean scores ranging from good to excellent. The one sample T test showed statistically significant differences between participants’ sum scores within each group (p<0,001). Group discussion led to suggestions for quality improvement e.g. enhanced feedback strategies between team members.
Conclusion
The questionnaire used in our study shows to be a feasible and useful instrument for the evaluation of the palliative care teams’ day-to-day operations and to identify areas for quality improvement.
Practical implications
The CAL™OCQ is a promising instrument to evaluate any healthcare team functioning. A group discussion on the questionnaire scores can serve as a starting point to identify targets for quality improvement initiatives.",

This concept and its application have also been the topic of extensive research. Up till now, this work lacks a more comprehensive theoretical framework, and this paper fills this gap. We provide a theoretical basis for understanding the dynamics through which regional industrial systems change their connectiveness in an attempt to reduce their ecological impact. We position our framework within the field of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive literature search in the ISI Web of Science database for publications that listed ‘industrial symbiosis’, ‘eco-industrial park’, or a combination of ‘industrial-ecology’ and ‘regional’ as a topic. The framework conceptualizes industrial symbiosis as a process at two levels: (1) the level of the regional industrial system (RIS), and (2) the societal level where the concept and routines of industrial symbiosis diffuse. We link the dynamics at these levels to changes in ecological impact and increase in institutional capacity. We conclude with a research agenda based on the variables and their basic relationships specified in our framework. The main line of research we propose is to systematically investigate how institutional capacity evolves over time in regional industrial systems and how it affects the ecological impact of such systems. We also propose to investigate how insights from existing literature about stimulating and impeding factors to industrial symbiosis can be understood in terms of mechanisms of transmission and how these mechanisms interact to create nationally distinct patterns of diffusion of industrial symbiosis.",

Building a capacity for resilience might be a daunting task when one considers the multitude of components, processes, and interactions that take place within and beyond a city’s physical, logical (i.e. legal), and virtual (cyberspace) boundaries. Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities, an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions that organize these components and develop the capacity to address various structuring of components and their interactions with the ultimate goal of achieving resilience. This paper provides a deeper look at resilience in cities, proposes a conceptual resilience framework, and includes a discussion and analysis of the framework. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a more holistic approach to designing, planning, and managing for resilience by including an evaluation of cultural and process dynamics within cities as well as their physical elements.",

Interdependence occurs in supply chains because supply chain partners depend upon one another for product and process accomplishments and for the tangible and intangible resources owned by their partners. Framing the supply chain as a complex adaptive system, we argue that, in supply chain contexts, both the degree of interdependence (i.e., the average number of interactions among the supply chain firms) and the overall interdependence pattern (which maps with who each supply chain firm interacts) moderate the relationship between trust and supply chain performance. The proposed conceptual framework is operationalized through the NK fitness landscape model and tested using simulation and Tobit regression analyses. Results confirm that the specific interdependence pattern that characterizes the supply chain has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between trust and supply chain performance, while the moderating effect exerted by the degree of interdependence is not statistically significant.",

Goal models capture hierarchical representations of stakeholder objectives, requirements, possible solutions, and their relationships to help requirements engineers understand stakeholder goals and explore solutions based on their impact on these goals. To reuse a goal model and benefit from the strengths of goal modeling, we argue that it is necessary (i) to make sure that analysis and validation of goal models is possible through reuse hierarchies, (ii) to provide the means to delay decision making to a later point in the reuse hierarchy, (iii) to take constraints imposed by other modeling notations into account during analysis, (iv) to allow context dependent information to be modeled so that the goal model can be used in various reuse contexts, and (v) to provide an interface for reuse. Objective: In this two-part systematic literature review, we (i) evaluate how well existing goal modeling approaches support reusability with our five desired characteristics of contextual and reusable goal models, (ii) categorize these approaches based on language constructs for context modeling and connection to other modeling formalisms, and then (iii) draw our conclusions on future research themes. Method: Following guidelines by Kitchenham, the review is conducted on seven major academic search engines. Research questions, inclusion criteria, and categorization criteria are specified, and threats to validity are discussed. A final list of 146 publications and 34 comparisons/assessments of goal modeling approaches is discussed in more detail. Results: Five major research themes are derived to realize reusable goal models with context dependent information. Conclusion: The results indicate that existing goal modeling approaches do not fully address the required capabilities for reusability in different contexts and that further research is needed to fill this gap in the landscape of goal modeling approaches.",

Yet, frameworks that accommodate this paradigm have limited support to address security concerns, hindering their usage in real scenarios. We address this challenge by enhancing models@run.time with the notions of trust and reputation. Trust improves decision-making processes under risk and uncertainty and constitutes a distributed and flexible mechanism that does not entail heavyweight administration. This paper presents a trust and reputation framework that is integrated into a distributed component-model that implements the models@run.time paradigm, thus allowing the system to include trust in their reasoning process. The framework is illustrated in a chat application by implementing several state-of-the-art trust and reputation models. We show that the framework entails negligible computational overhead and that it requires a minimal amount of work for developers.",

Despite this, climate adaptation at the community level has not received adequate conceptual attention, and a limited number of analytical frameworks are available for assessing place-specific adaptations, particularly in a fisheries context. We use conceptual material from social-ecological systems (SES) resilience and human development resilience to build an integrated framework for evaluating community adaptations to climate change in a fisheries setting. The framework defines resilience as the combined result of coping, adapting, and transforming—recognizing resilience as a system’s capacity and as a process. This understanding of resilience integrates with the three development resilience concepts of resistance, rootedness, and resourcefulness to develop ‘place-based elements’ which refer to collective action, institutions, agency, and indigenous and local knowledge systems. The proposed framework can capture a local setting’s place-specific attributes relating to the well-being of individuals, households, and communities, and the through integration of SES and human development conceptualizations addresses some of the key critiques of the notion of resilience. We have proposed this framework for application in context-specific environments—including fisheries—as a means of assessing community adaptations.",

This article draws from complexity science to develop an overarching framework for the study of Complexity Leadership Theory, a leadership paradigm that focuses on enabling the learning, creative, and adaptive capacity of complex adaptive systems (CAS) within a context of knowledge-producing organizations. This conceptual framework includes three entangled leadership roles (i.e., adaptive leadership, administrative leadership, and enabling leadership) that reflect a dynamic relationship between the bureaucratic, administrative functions of the organization and the emergent, informal dynamics of complex adaptive systems (CAS).",

This work defines a conceptual framework to characterize the cooperation between humans and autonomous CPSs and provides techniques for applying the framework in order to design proper human integration. The emergent autonomous car domain is considered as a running example. It covers some of the current limitations of involving drivers into the autonomous functionalities.

If software systems are to behave more intelligently, they will need to be able to adapt to the changing external world. The agent-oriented paradigm offers the potential to build adaptive systems. This paper explores the nature of adaptivity in multi-agent systems by exploring how to represent adaptivity in agent-oriented models. Rather than focussing on mechanisms for individual agents to be highly adaptive, we advocate regarding adaptivity as a quality goal of an overall multi-agent system. Discussing agent-oriented models should help guide where design tradeoffs need to be made. Learning can be approached in a similar way to adaptivity, where learning is viewed as an attribute of the system rather than a fundamental property of individual agents. Examples are given from use of automated teller machines at mobile sites and intelligent information agents.",

abstract = "Previous studies have shown that the open property regime of mobile pastoralists in the Logone Floodplain, Cameroon works as a complex adaptive system in which individual movement decisions result in an ideal free distribution of grazing pressure over common-pool grazing resources. Recently, the humanitarian crisis in the Chad Basin caused by Boko Haram has resulted in the arrival of thousands of pastoralist refugees from Northeastern Nigeria in the Far North Region of Cameroon. In this paper, we examine the impact of pastoralist refugees on the resilience of the open property regime. First, we describe the migratory flight of pastoralists. Second, we examine whether and how the pastoralist refugee crisis affected the open property regime, in particular the distribution of pastoralists over grazing resources. Data were collected in a longitudinal and interdisciplinary study that integrated spatial and ethnographic approaches to describe and explain the distribution of pastoralists in the Logone Floodplain from 2008 to 2016. The results show that the number of pastoralist refugees from Nigeria exceeds 1000 households with an estimated 100,000 cattle. However, despite the large number of pastoralist refugees, we continue to find evidence of an ideal free distribution of pastoralists over grazing resources in the Logone Floodplain. Moreover, we found that pastoralists, while frustrated by the increasing grazing pressure, remained committed to the ethos of open access. The study offers evidence of the resilience of the open property regime and we discuss the reasons for the resilience of this complex adaptive system using the concept of panarchy.",

abstract = "At present, an energy transition consistent with achieving the goals set out by the Paris climate agreement is not occurring, primarily due to lock-in dynamics at the societal and energy business complex level. To contribute to discussions on how to unlock a major system transformation, we introduce here a new framework that characterises the energy business as a system and traces its metabolism. Drawing analogies with biology and using metabolic maps, we present a systems analysis across-scales; from the Earth system down to the energy business purpose level. Our analysis shows energy directors and managers face unfavourable conditions that inhibit radical business model decisions consistent with safely achieving emission targets. One such condition is how the intensity of the Earth system feedback signal is significantly reduced by the time it arrives at the corporate decision-making level, primarily due to social information filters and corporate law. Secondly, the shareholder profit maximisation purpose of companies is found to hold a systemic role in the energy business lock-in and may be incompatible with avoiding dangerous climate change. To achieve an energy transformation that safeguards Earth system resilience, our discussion suggests focusing on the intrinsic purpose and governance of the system, arguing that relying on external economic adjustments alone, such as carbon pricing, may help but could fall short of achieving the necessary shift. Fundamental Earth stewardship is needed from energy business actors. Like with nationally determined contributions (i.e. INDCs), a bottom-up approach to proposing contributions to climate-consistent business model pathways may facilitate the dialogue.",

The objective of our research is to investigate the concepts and implementations of reasoning processes for S-CPSs, and more specifically, the frameworks proposed for the fuzzy front end of their reasoning mechanisms. The objectives of the paper are: (i) to analyze the framework concepts and implementations of CPS, (ii) to review the literature concerning system-level reasoning and its enablers from the points of view of the processed knowledge, building awareness, reasoning mechanisms, decision making, and adaptation. Our findings are: (i) awareness and adaptation behaviors are considered as system-level smartness of S-CPSs that are not achieved by traditional design approaches; (ii) model-based and composability approaches insufficiently support the development of reasoning mechanisms for S-CPSs; (iii) frameworks for development of reasoning in S-CPS should support compositional design. Based on the conclusions above, we argue that coping with the challenges of compositionality requires both software-level integration and holistic fusion of knowledge by means of semantic transformations. This entails the need for a multi aspect framework that is able to capture at least conceptual, functional, architectural, informational, interoperation, and behavioral aspects. It needs further investigation if a compositionality enabling framework should appear in the form of a meta-framework (abstract) or in the form of a semantically integrated (concrete) framework.",

abstract = "Agile software development methodology and DevOps, together, have helped the business to achieve agility and velocity in delivering time-to-market applications and services. Open-source software (OSS) and cloud technologies are taking up business innovation and DevOps at new heights. However, in the quest of agility and velocity, user data security and privacy assurance often get lower priority as they are perceived as a time-consuming activity requiring specialized people, process, and technology. We see this problem being addressed by integrating security in DevOps processes. Security for DevOps has been institutionalized as DevSecOps with practical considerations for a given business context. In this work, we proposed a conceptual security model, ADOC, to facilitate adopting DevSecOps for the business processes capitalizing OSS over the cloud. This work contributes towards the following to integrate continuous security in application and service delivery: (i) A continuous security conceptual framework proposal based on the requirements elicited from the analysis of challenges in adopting DevSecOps using OSS over the cloud. (ii) An integrationist security model, ADOC, based on the proposed continuous security conceptual framework, integrating development, security, and operation activities through automation of security controls using OSS over the cloud. (iii) A set of inter-working OSS tools for automation of the proposed security controls in ADOC workflow and practices. (iv) A set of metrics for performance measurement of the ADOC model. (v) Mapping of the solutions for the analyzed challenges using the proposed security controls, followed by a use case scenario to adopt the ADOC workflow and continuous practices. The ADOC transforms security being adhoc compliance-oriented activities into continuous assurance-oriented activities by codifying security controls into an automated delivery workflow. Its practical adoption enables businesses to deliver time-to-market security ready applications and services with accelerated velocity and sustainable agility in a cost-effective way.",

The EOCFS further evolves the output domain and adds more fuzzy rules to achieve an effective rule base. The proposed model is a self-organizing method that can automatically identify prominent distinct data in the output domain for a new fuzzy rule. Thus, the EOCFS constantly evolves by reducing the model error. In addition, the evolving process is realized on the output domain while the self-adaptive process is achieved on the output domain and its associated input domain. The evolving termination index and uncertainty controller of the self-adaptive process are dynamically attained from past and current knowledge. Therefore, effective rule base is the balanced fuzzy model of the approximated system. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, synthetic and real-world data are considered with low to high dimension inputs. Results show that the proposed EOCFS achieves better performance than the existing models with regard to accuracy and number of rules.",

Compartmentalising or ignoring the diversity of stakeholder perspectives, policy objectives, and the complexity of nature has not worked.

Progressing environmental and development policies in isolation diminishes policy effectiveness, polarises communities by engendering dislocation, fear and conflict, and leads to ineffectual or deleterious natural and rural systems management. Conservation and rural policy can be recast to a new rural–urban dynamic: progressing from food and fibre production with little regard for externalities to one of food, fibre and sustainable natural and rural systems. We propose a conceptual framework based on the interdependence of humans and nature that recognises multiple forms of capital, and their role in environmental management and community development. Specifically, the ‘forms of capital’ framework directs attention to the transformational properties of different forms of capital and to the deterministic socio-economic and political drivers of change. Integrating system governance and stewardship, in conjunction with coordinated, self-adapting processes of research, planning, monitoring and system evaluation, offers a means of improving sustainable management of the complex inter-relationships between people and nature.",

An in-depth critique of research across leading peer-reviewed tourism journals, involving 102 individual papers; 63 on crises and disasters, and 39 on tourism recovery frameworks, was undertaken to develop a post-conflict tourism recovery framework. The framework proposed synthesizes complex relationships for post-conflict destinations operating “on the edge of chaos”, and enables consideration of key factors that influence their capacity to be resilient, adapt, and recover.",

At one level, this is a straightforward concept, but at another it is a rich multi-dimensional conceptual framework involving the following key dimensions: models of everywhere, models of everything and models at all times, being constantly re-evaluated against the most current evidence. This is a compelling approach with the potential to deal with epistemic uncertainties and non-linearities. However, the approach has, as yet, not been fully utilised or explored. This paper examines the concept of models of everywhere in the light of recent advances in technology. The paper argues that, when first proposed, technology was a limiting factor but now, with advances in areas such as Internet of Things, cloud computing and data analytics, many of the barriers have been alleviated. Consequently, it is timely to look again at the concept of models of everywhere in practical conditions as part of a trans-disciplinary effort to tackle the remaining research questions. The paper concludes by identifying the key elements of a research agenda that should underpin such experimentation and deployment.",

This has resulted in a plethora of perspectives and treatments. The diversity of phenomena going under the moniker of emergence raises the question of what these phenomena have in common and whether different types of emergence can be distinguished on general grounds. Since emergence is recognised in so many different fields as a relevant concept, it would be useful to have a general conceptual framework that allows a treatment of emergence without explicit reference to the specific underlying mechanism. This article aims to provide a general framework in which emergence can be addressed. For this a new concept, the conjugate, is introduced and the place of the observer relative to the system is given a renewed appreciation. Since the framework abstracts from the underlying interactions, emergence in different types of systems can be compared and discussed on equal terms. Reframing emergence in this way leads to a typology of emergences that is both illuminating and integrative In the elaboration the concepts and different types of emergence are discussed and compared with other treatments and typologies of emergence in the literature. Examples from various fields are given to illustrate the theoretical discourse. Furthermore applications of the concepts and typology to social systems, evolution, and co-evolution in ecosystems will be given It will be concluded that many apparently different views and treatments of emergence can be restated and compared within the framework presented in this article.",

abstract = "Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities. Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes. We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources, and the dependant human communities can be managed independently. Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.",

This conceptual paper discusses prolonged PS sequences involving different professionals and different types of professionals. It is framed by the dual concepts of service episodes, representing the client's perspective and experience, and PS supply chains, that is, organized sequences of professional, clerical, and technical services explicitly set up to provide specific results, such as producing a financial product, designing a house, or replacing a hip. Four illustrative, empirically inspired situations are used to characterize episodes and supply chains. Each exemplar, two each from the health and social work sectors, is real and draws on publicly available data. The richness of the public information is a reflection of the fact that each is some form of failure or “disaster” (Altay and Ramirez, 2010). This dual conceptualization leads to a holistic perspective obtained by using the complex adaptive systems framework (Dooley and Van de ven, 1999, Levin, 1998) as a lens. The paper concludes with a discussion of the dynamics of such service systems and some proposals for a research agenda.",

abstract = "Adaptive co-management brings together collaborative and adaptive approaches in pursuit of sustainable resource use and social–ecological resilience. Enthusiasm for this management approach, however, is countered by recent critiques regarding outcomes. A lack of evidence from consistent evaluation of adaptive co-management further exacerbates this situation. This paper revisits the issue of evaluation in natural resource management and recasts it in light of complex adaptive systems thinking. An evaluative framework for adaptive co-management is developed which directs attention toward three broad components: ecosystem conditions, livelihood outcomes and process and institutional conditions. Scale-specific parameters are offered for each component to facilitate systematic learning from experience and encourage cross-site comparisons. Conclusions highlight the importance of systematically incorporating evaluation into the adaptive co-management process and recognize the challenge for resource agencies and researchers to shift from a conventional to a complex adaptive system perspective.",

Such environments must be incorporated into models of interactive computation. By the No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT), no general-purpose function-optimization algorithm can exist that is superior to random search. But interactive adaptation in environments with persistent state falls outside the scope of the NFLT, and useful general-purpose interactive optimization protocols for DPEs exist, as we show. Persistence of state supports indirect interaction. Based on the observation that mutual causation is inherent to interactive computation, and on the key role of persistent state in multiagent systems, we establish that indirect interaction is essential to multiagent systems (MASs). This work will be useful to researchers in coordination, evolutionary computation, and design of multiagent and adaptive systems.",

This dynamic process follows three fundamental strategies (restore, explore, and abandon) articulated in historical concepts of physiological adaptation such as homeostasis, allostasis, and the general adaptation syndrome. These strategies correspond to elementary forms of behavior (ordered, chaotic, and static) in complex adaptive systems and invite a network-based analysis of the operational characteristics, allowing us to propose an integrated framework of physiological adaptation from a complex network perspective. Applicability of this concept is illustrated by analyzing molecular and cellular mechanisms of adaptation in response to the pervasive challenge of obesity, a chronic condition resulting from sustained nutrient excess that prompts chaotic exploration for system stability associated with tradeoffs and a risk of adverse outcomes such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Deconstruction of this complexity holds the promise of gaining novel insights into physiological adaptation in health and disease.",

A conceptual framework incorporating social, economic, institutional/governmental, material domains and community capital was established with reference to the work of Cutter, Burton, and Emrich (2010), and was applied as the conceptual springboard to assess the resilience of Tangjialing village. The results suggested that the GLR in Tangjialing village was generally a successful practice for enhancing CR, which was tightly associated with the economic empowerment for local residents and formalization of informal economic activities and negatively affected by insufficient public engagement. Accordingly, policy implications about enhancing the resilience such as protecting the farmers' “private rights” as landowners, providing employment guidance and assistance and implementing cooperative planning were proposed.",

These changes are having important impacts on health and well-being and on the capacity of health systems to respond to health-related problems. This paper focuses on the creation of institutions to overcome information asymmetry and encourage the provision of safe, effective and affordable health services in this context of complexity and rapid change. It presents a review of literature on different approaches to the analysis of the management of system development and institution-building. There is a general agreement that the outcome of an intervention depends a great deal on the way that a large number of agents respond. Their response is influenced by the institutional arrangements that mediate relationships between health sector actors and also by their understandings and expectations of how other actors will respond. The impact of a policy or specific intervention is difficult to predict and there is a substantial risk of unintended outcomes. This creates the need for an iterative learning approach in which widespread experimentation is encouraged, good and bad experiences are evaluated and policies are formulated on the basis of the lessons learned. This enables actors to learn their roles and responsibilities and the appropriate responses to new incentive structures. The paper concludes with an outline of the information needs of managers of health system change in societies in the midst of rapid development.",

abstract = "Defects and errors in new or recently completed construction work continually pervade the industry. Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.",

To assess SES resilience, we constructed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a land use system as a stereotypical example of SES and investigated how resilience of the represented system is affected by both external disturbances and internal dynamics. The model explicitly considered different aspects of resilience in a framework derived from literature, which includes “resilience to”, “resilience of”, “resilience at”, “resilience due to”, and “indicators of resilience”. External disturbances were implemented as shocks in crop yields. Internal dynamics comprised of two types of social interaction between agents (learning and cooperation), an ecological feedback of soil depletion and an economic feedback of agglomeration benefits. We systematically varied these mechanisms and measured indicators that reflected spatial, social, and economic resilience. Results showed that (1) internal mechanisms increased the ability of the system to recover from external shocks, (2) feedbacks resulted in different regimes of crop cultivation, each with a distinctive set of functions, and (3) resilience is not a generic system property, but strongly depends on what system function is considered. We recommend future studies to include internal dynamics, especially feedbacks, and to systematically assess them across different aspects of resilience.",

However, traditional service methods for acquiring geospatial data are inefficient and cumbersome, which is not beneficial for timely data acquisition. In these service methods, data are obtained and published by managers and are then left to users to discover and to retrieve them. To solve this problem, we propose an event-driven active on-demand data service method, for which a prototype based on sensor web technologies is demonstrated. First, we select a subset of observed properties as the attributes of an observation event of a data service system. Event-filtering technologies are then employed to find the data desired by users. Finally, the data that meet the subscription requirement are pushed to subscribers on time. The aims of the implementation of the method are to test the suitability of the observation and measurement (O&M) profile for Earth observation and OGC event pattern markup language (EML) specification. We determined the attributes of observation events according to the requirement of the data service and encoded observation event information using the OGC Observations and Measurements specification. We encoded the information under filtering conditions using the OGC Event Pattern Markup Language specification. We implemented a data service method that is based on event-driven architecture via a combination of some sensor web enablement services. Finally, we verified the feasibility of the method using MODIS data from the forest fires that occurred on February 7, 2009, in Victoria, Australia. The results show that the proposed method can achieve actively pushing the desired data to subscribers in the shortest possible time. O&M profiles for Earth observation and EML are suitable for the metadata encoding of observation events and the encoding of subscription information respectively. They match well for the data service in the system.",

This article draws upon ecosystem services theory to develop a framework to guide the M&E of collaborative environmental programs with anticipated social benefits. The framework has six components: program need, program activities, pathway process variables, moderating process variables, outcomes, and program value. Needs are defined in terms of ecosystem services, as well as other human needs that must be addressed to achieve outcomes. The pathway variable relates to the development of natural resource governance capacity in the target community. Moderating processes can be externalities such as the inherent capacity of the natural system to service ecosystem needs, local demand for natural resources, policy or socio-economic drivers. Internal program-specific processes relate to program service delivery, targeting and participant responsiveness. Ecological outcomes are expressed in terms of changes in landscape structure and function, which in turn influence ecosystem service provision. Social benefits derived from the program are expressed in terms of the value of the eco-social service to user-specified goals. The article provides suggestions from the literature for identifying indicators and measures for components and component variables, and concludes with an example of how the framework was used to inform the M&E of an adaptive co-management program in western Kenya.",

Such studies have mostly been based on conducting surveys through questionnaires and interviews, and have targeted specific industrial sectors and / or geographic boundaries. For helping companies implement lean, a number of frameworks have been developed. Most of them though, look like more as roadmaps, prescribing the sequence of the various lean tools that have to be adopted without considering the complexity of the human factor. It comes thus as no surprise, that many companies have failed and were not able to reap the benefits of lean manufacturing. In all literature reviewed, successful lean implementation is accompanied by a change in the way companies value the different dimensions of work. One of the major challenges of lean implementation is guiding the change journey as detailed in the implementation plan. Lean manufacturing requires change in structure, system, process, and employee behaviour. In the present paper, a conceptual framework based on change management theory is proposed and discussed.",

abstract = "This paper acknowledges the need for revolutionary designs to devise the Future Internet by presenting a clean-slate Concern-Oriented Reference Model (CORM) for architecting future networks. CORM is derived in accordance to the Function–Behavior–Structure engineering framework, conceiving computer networks as a distributed software-dependent complex system. CORM networks are designed along two main dimensions: a vertical dimension addressing structure and configuration of network building blocks; and a horizontal dimension addressing communication and interaction among the previously formulated building blocks. For each network dimension, CORM factors the design space into function, structure, and behavior, applying to each the principle of separation of concerns for further systematic decomposition. Perceiving the network as a complex system, CORM constructs the network recursively in a bottom–up approach starting by the network building block, whose structure and behavior are inspired by an evolutionary bacterium cell. Hence, CORM is bio-inspired, it refutes the long-endorsed concept of layering, it accounts intrinsically for emergent behavior fostering network integrity and stability. We conjecture that networks designed according to CORM-based architectures can adapt and further evolve to better fit their contexts. To justify our conjecture, we derive and simulate a CORM-based architecture for ad hoc networks.",

abstract = "Uncertainty how ecosystems will behave and look like in the future has been increasing. Several concepts, such as sustainable, adaptive, or risk-based management, were proposed to cope with uncertain, incomplete knowledge, and with changing environmental conditions. However, there is a lack of agreement what those concepts mean and how they differ from traditional forest management approaches. The paper aims at (1) exploring general systems theory, control theory, and risk management theory for general principles that may be guiding the future development of ecosystem management, and that (2) developing a concept in adaptive ecosystem management that may act as a shared mental model for both scholars and practitioners. The exploration of systems- and risk-based theories results in decisive foundations of adaptive management: (1) emergence, adaptation, and resilience are fundamental concepts to characterize the dynamic behavior of ecosystems, accounting for their ability for purposeful transformational change. (2) Space–time scale matters. The space–time window of traditional, silviculture-based forestry has been focusing on the patch and stand level, whereas adaptive management has to consider much larger time-space windows, covering a range from the needle to the landscape. (3) Risk-informed management starts with the identification of critical effects, then quantifies the dose–response relationship between exogenous strain and endogenous stress. The paper proposes a concept in adaptive ecosystem management, being founded on three general concepts. First, control theory is the backbone to keep system dynamics within an acceptable range even if external disturbances are acting, the underlying model is based on uncertainties, and if the real process can only be modeled incompletely. Second, adaptive ecosystem management has to focus on processes across different space–time scales instead of looking at the static, “frozen” structures like trees of stands. Third, interaction of processes across space–time scales, characterized by dose–response functions, are the driving forces to shape the long-term development of the systems. The proposed concept challenges different domains. Research has to improve its understanding of process interactions across space–time scales, characterized by dose–response models, which are essential to understand system robustness (resilience). Higher education related to ecosystem management should refocus on scientific competences to the analysis of complex adaptive systems, and the use of control theory to continuously improve policies and practices for ecosystem management. Practitioners on the ground have to become convinced that the goal of ecosystem management is a “moving target”, consisting of a portfolio of ecosystem goods and services. They have to internalize the principle of “rule discovery” as a systematic learning process to improve management practices and by looking for “biodiversity in our minds”. The paper is expected to trigger discussions among scholars and practitioners, leading to a set of principles for resource use that consider both complexity and dynamics of ecosystems.",

Availability of such generalized symbolic constructs may be particularly important when addressing a complex adaptive system such as a marine ecosystem. Various examples have appeared in the climate–fisheries literature, each more or less effectively integrating hypothesized effects of several interacting environmental and/or biological processes in controlling population dynamics of exploited fish species. A selection of these are herein presented and reviewed, including match–mismatch, connectivity, school trap, loopholes, ocean triads, stable ocean hypothesis, several classes of nonlinear feedback loops (e.g., ‘P2P’, school-mix feedback, predator pit), as well as several prominent large-scale integrative climatic index series (SOI, NAO, PDO). The importance of considering the potential for adaptation and/or rapid evolution is stressed. An argument is offered for the potential utility of such widely recognizable schematic concepts in offering relatively well-understood, fairly well-defined frameworks for comparative identification and elaboration of important mechanistic linkages between climate variability and fishery dynamics, as well as in easing effective communication among scientists from different regions and disciplinary backgrounds. Certain difficulties in the application of the comparative method are discussed. It is suggested that alleviation of such difficulties may be one of the major benefits of international collaborative programs such as GLOBEC and IMBER.",

Agile capabilities refer to both the project portfolio organization's intensity of and competence in applying agile practices. Using a sample of 135 portfolios and multiple informants for each portfolio, the results support entrepreneurial orientation and voice behavior as antecedents for agile capabilities. Furthermore, the findings support an agile portfolio's positive relationship with emergence recognition and overall portfolio success. The findings contribute to the literature by identifying two significant antecedents of agile capabilities as well as empirically demonstrating the positive relationship between agile portfolios and emerging strategy recognition. For practitioners, the study encourages the application of agile practices by stressing the general positive influence of agile capabilities and underlines entrepreneurial orientation and voice behavior as important methods of empowerment for agile portfolio processes.",

Those domains range from existing research areas such as computer networks and collective robotics to upcoming areas of agent-based and insect-based computing; also including applications on the internet and in games and movies. CI systems are complex by nature and (1) are effectively adaptive in uncertain and unknown environments, (2) can organise themselves autonomously, and (3) exhibit ‘emergent’ behaviour. Among others, multi-agent systems, complex adaptive systems, swarm intelligence and self-organising systems are considered to be such systems. The explosive wild growth of research studies of CI systems has not yet led to a systematic approach for model design of these kinds of systems. Although there have been recent efforts on the issue of system design (the complete design trajectory from identifying system requirements up to implementation), the problem of choosing and specifying a good model of a CI system is often done implicitly and sometimes even completely ignored. The aim of this article is to bring to the attention that model design is an essential as well as an integral part of system design. We present a constructive approach to systematically design, build and test models of CI systems. Because simulation is often used as a way to research CI systems, we particularly focus on models that can be used for simulation. Additionally, we show that it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel: here, we show how existing models and algorithms can be used for CI model design. The approach is illustrated by means of two example studies on a (semi-automated) multi-player game and collaborative robotics.",

abstract = "Integrated environmental resources management is a purposeful activity with the goal to maintain and improve the state of an environmental resource affected by human activities. In many cases different goals are in conflict and the notion “integrated” clearly indicates that resources management should be approached from a broad perspective taking all potential trade-offs and different scales in space and time into account. However, we are yet far from putting into practice integrated resources management fully taking into account the complexity of human-technology-environment systems. The tradition of resources management and of dealing with environmental problems is characterized by a command and control approach. The increasing awareness for the complexity of environmental problems and of human-technology-environment systems has triggered the development of new management approaches. The paper discusses the importance of focusing on the transition to new management paradigms based on the insight that the systems to be managed are complex adaptive systems. It provides arguments for the role of social learning processes and the need to develop methods combining approaches from hard and soft systems analysis. Soft systems analysis focuses on the importance of subjective perceptions and socially constructed reality. Soft systems methods and group model building techniques are quite common in management science where the prime target of management has always been the social system. Resources management is still quite slow to take up such innovations that should follow as a logical consequence of adopting an integrated management approach. Integrated water resources management is used as example to provide evidence for the need to implement participatory and adaptive management approaches that are able to cope with increasing uncertainties arising from fast changing socio-economic conditions and global and climate change. Promising developments and future research directions are discussed. The paper concludes with pointing out the need for changes in the scientific community to improve the conditions for interdisciplinary, system-oriented and trans-disciplinary research.",

abstract = "Planning in modern urban environments requires skills to address complexity in order to move towards sustainability. Co-production of knowledge in transdisciplinary groups represents a useful tool in such contexts. Using the concepts of epistemic communities, linguistic diversity and culture, the article proposes a conceptual framework for analysing complexity of co-production settings, as an indispensable means of managing complex challenges, thus making these complexities visible for the project leader (facilitator) and the participants of the co-production process. We evaluate the framework on the basis of inclusivity, cross-sectoral understanding, applicability in different contexts and time perspectives. Based on the framework, we identify several aspects that a process leader (facilitator) would need to address when preparing for a co-production process: linguistic equality between participants, disciplinary integrity, a working culture of mutual respect, simultaneous mitigation and informed facilitation. Finally, the article suggests possible future research areas related to development of the framework, including (i) identification of levels of complexity and mapping specific tools to address complexity at each level; (ii) integration of other factors of complexity, such as political and institutional contexts, as well as diversity of gender and age in the facilitated group.",

Collective approaches to the use and management of green space in urban social-ecological systems, as a form of social-ecological innovation, provide a valuable resource in the production and adaptive management of local ecosystem services. Urban social-ecological innovation (USEI), therefore, comprises an important consideration in urban environmental governance. Research on innovation in urban social-ecological systems is analysed here and an evaluation of the insights thereby derived culminates in the development of a conceptual framework. We propose that such a framework can be applied by practitioners and researchers alike to evaluate the mediating nature of USEI towards increasing the resilience of productive urban landscapes.",

abstract = "Ambiguity is a potential problem in any semantic question answering (SQA) system due to the nature of idiosyncrasy in composing natural language (NL) question and semantic resources. Thus, disambiguation of SQA systems is a field of ongoing research. Ambiguity occurs in SQA because a word or a sentence can have more than one meaning or multiple words in the same language can share the same meaning. Therefore, an SQA system needs disambiguation solutions to select the correct meaning when the linguistic triples matched with multiple KB concepts, and enumerate similar words especially when linguistic triples do not match with any KB concept. The latest development in this field is a solution for SQA systems that is able to process a complex NL question while accessing open-domain data from linked open data (LOD). The contributions in this paper include (1) formulating an SQA conceptual framework based on an in-depth study of existing SQA processes; (2) identifying the ambiguity types, specifically in English based on an interdisciplinary literature review; (3) highlighting the ambiguity types that had been resolved by the previous SQA studies; and (4) analysing the results of the existing SQA disambiguation solutions, the complexity of NL question processing, and the complexity of data retrieval from KB(s) or LOD. The results of this review demonstrated that out of thirteen types of ambiguity identified in the literature, only six types had been successfully resolved by the previous studies. Efforts to improve the disambiguation are in progress for the remaining unresolved ambiguity types to improve the accuracy of the formulated answers by the SQA system. The remaining ambiguity types are potentially resolved in the identified SQA process based on ambiguity scenarios elaborated in this paper. The results of this review also demonstrated that most existing research on SQA systems have treated the processing of the NL question complexity separate from the processing of the KB structure complexity.",

To explore a novel clue for clinically effective targeted therapies, we analyzed the molecular circuitry of HNSCC through the lens that HNSCC is an evolving system. In the trajectory of this somatic evolution, HNSCC acquires biological robustness under a variety of selective pressures including genetic, epigenetic, micro-environmental and metabolic stressors, which well explains the major mechanism of “escaping from oncogene addiction”. On the other hand, this systemic view appears to instruct us approaches to target latent vulnerability of HNSCC that is masked behind the plasticity and evolvability of this complex adaptive system.",

abstract = "Context
The management of software development productivity is a key issue in software organizations, where the major drivers are lower cost and shorter time-to-market. Agile methods, including Extreme Programming and Scrum, have evolved as “light” approaches that simplify the software development process, potentially leading to increased team productivity. However, little empirical research has examined which factors do have an impact on productivity and in what way, when using agile methods.
Objective
Our objective is to provide a better understanding of the factors and mediators that impact agile team productivity.
Method
We have conducted a multiple-case study for 6months in three large Brazilian companies that have been using agile methods for over 2years. We have focused on the main productivity factors perceived by team members through interviews, documentation from retrospectives, and non-participant observation.
Results
We developed a novel conceptual framework, using thematic analysis to understand the possible mechanisms behind such productivity factors. Agile team management was found to be the most influential factor in achieving agile team productivity. At the intra-team level, the main productivity factors were team design (structure and work allocation) and member turnover. At the inter-team level, the main productivity factors were how well teams could be effectively coordinated by proper interfaces and other dependencies and avoiding delays in providing promised software to dependent teams.
Conclusion
Teams should be aware of the influence and magnitude of turnover, which has been shown negative for agile team productivity. Team design choices remain an important factor impacting team productivity, even more pronounced on agile teams that rely on teamwork and people factors. The intra-team coordination processes must be adjusted to enable productive work by considering priorities and pace between teams. Finally, the revised conceptual framework for agile team productivity supports further tests through confirmatory studies.",

A review of transformation approaches towards sustainability shows that these do not (sufficiently) link processes of change at the micro level to deep leverages of change in wider system structures. Addressing this research gap, we develop a conceptual framework for a social-ecological transformation that connects the macro and the micro level and helps to bridge process-oriented and structural approaches to transformation. At the macro level, the objectives of inter- and intragenerational justice need to be pursued by challenging the central paradigms that constitute unsustainable trajectories. To make the framework concrete and applicable in practice, we propose a preliminary set of evaluation principles for the micro and meso level that reflect these normative objectives and help to measure the transformative character and transformative impact of change processes. The example of the European Organic Breeding Network illustrates the application of the framework. An Ecological Economics research that is reflective of its transformative quality in light of the incumbent paradigms can make important contributions to transformation research.",

Studies were included if they reported at least one factor associated with the implementation of community-based peer-led HPPs. Fifty-five studies were selected for the analysis. The method known as “best fit framework synthesis” was used to analyze the factors identified in the selected papers. Many factors included in existing implementation conceptual frameworks were deemed applicable to peer-led HPPs. However, other factors related to individuals, programs, and implementation context also emerged from the analysis. Based on this synthesis, an adapted theoretical framework was elaborated, grounded in a complex adaptive system perspective and specifying potential mechanisms through which factors may influence implementation of community-based peer-led HPPs. Further research is needed to test the theoretical framework against empirical data. Findings from this scoping review increase our knowledge of the optimal conditions for implementing peer-led HPPs and thereby maximizing the benefits of such programs.",

Insufficient research has been conducted to date towards identifying the conceptual structures that would explain and encourage large-scale BIM adoption. This paper introduces a number of macro-adoption models, matrices and charts (Fig. 1). These models can be used to systematically assess BIM adoption across markets, and inform the structured development of country-specific BIM adoption policies. This research is published in two complementary papers combining conceptual structures with data collected from experts across a number of countries. The first paper “Macro-BIM adoption: conceptual structures” delimits the terms used, reviews applicable diffusion models, and clarifies the research methodology. It then introduces five new conceptual constructs for assessing macro-BIM adoption and informing the development of market-scale BIM diffusion policies. The second paper “Macro-BIM adoption: comparative market analysis” employs these concepts and tools to evaluate BIM adoption and analyse BIM diffusion policies across a number of countries. Using online questionnaires and structured interviews, it applies the models, refines the conceptual tools and develops additional assessment metrics. The two papers are complementary and primarily intended to assist policy makers and domain researchers to analyse, develop and improve BIM diffusion policies.",

There is also a growing literature that draws on this work to address leadership concerns and practices, but whose authors are experienced in leadership education rather than in the substantive scientific fields whose findings they report and interpret. We shall refer to this arena as complexity leadership. The initial burst of enthusiasm for complexity management and leadership in the 1990s, as a conceptual framework for informing organisational practice, has not been sustained at its early intensity. However, the field continues to attract interest. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a discussion of the validity and significance of these ideas for the leadership of organisations. We enable this through a review of the literature, a critique, and some recommendations. The type of questions which we will be raising are: (1) What failings in current leadership theory or practice are claimed to be corrected? (2) How novel, and how plausible, are the leadership prescriptions which are derived from complexity theory? (3) Does complexity theory provide scientific authority for these prescriptions? We find a paradox in the complexity leadership message which, on the one hand, claims to be rooted in complexity theory, but at the same time, rejects key denominators of the hard sciences. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to constructively handle the apparent paradox.",

There is an emerging body of literature in management science supporting the proposition that success in engendering a coherent philosophy of health among students is dependent to a significant extent upon a college that subscribes to those same health principles not only in the curriculum but in the management practices of the organization. Health then becomes the natural state of affairs not only for patients, but for the organization as a whole. One model of health care which is health-oriented, person-centered and evidence-based is identified as the basis for a model of organizational health. The Total Quality Management (TQM) model is shown to reflect these characteristics. Its strengths and limitations are reviewed and the model is extended through the introduction of complex adaptive systems (CAS) concepts emerging from the complexity sciences. These concepts are given operational status through the introduction of Senge's work with systems theory and learning organizations. The linkage of learning, whole-thinking and health is suggested as a viable model of organizational health for chiropractic educational institutions.",

abstract = "Adaptive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (HMI2) are closed-loop cyber-physical systems comprising a network of sensors measuring human, environmental and mission parameters, in conjunction with suitable software for adapting the HMI2 (command, control and display functions) in response to these real-time measurements. Cognitive HMI2 are a particular subclass of these systems, which support dynamic HMI2 adaptations based on the user’s cognitive state. These states are estimated in real-time using various neuro-physiological parameters from gaze, cardiorespiratory and brain signals, which are processed by an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). However, the accuracy and precision of neuro-physiological measurements are affected by a variety of environmental factors and therefore need to be accurately characterised prior to operational use. This paper describes the characterisation activities performed on two types of eye tracking devices used in the Aerospace Intelligent and Autonomous Systems (AIAS) laboratory of RMIT University to support the development of cognitive human-machine systems. The uncertainty associated with the ANFIS outputs is quantified by propagating the uncertainties in the input data (determined experimentally) through the inference engine. This process is of growing relevance because similar machine learning techniques are now being developed for an increasing number of applications including aerospace, transport, biomedical and defence cyber-physical systems.",

The result is a systematic literature review of 64 CLSC management articles published in English. Conceptual gaps, process gaps and methodological gaps were found in relation to CLSC management under deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity. The analysis results in concrete research challenges for the CLSC management and sustainable supply chain management domains. The added value of this article is that the concepts of deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity for CLSC management are explored systematically for the first time. These two concepts appear to be crucial for the analysis of transitions to CLSC management.",

We explore the nature of stakeholder ownership and propose a conceptual framework which distills the requirements for its achievement into two themes—project governance and engagement processes. These themes are then enacted within each stage of an exploratory scenario planning process. Project governance deals with control and transparency in decision-making. It seeks to ensure that stakeholders make key decisions on project directions, processes and outputs. Engagement is based on the paradigm of collaboration or partnership. It requires the fostering of an environment for the safe expression of difference, mutual learning and co-generation of knowledge. We illustrate how the framework has been implemented in the context of planning for regional irrigated agriculture, provide an independent assessment of the level of stakeholder ownership achieved and reflect on project learnings, limitations and unresolved questions.",

abstract = "Many good evolutionary algorithms have been proposed in the past. However, frequently, the question arises that given a problem, one is at a loss of which algorithm to choose. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm portfolio approach to address the above problem for single objective optimization. A portfolio of evolutionary algorithms is first formed. Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), History driven Evolutionary Algorithm (HdEA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO2011) and Self adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) are chosen as component algorithms. Each algorithm runs independently with no information exchange. At any point in time, the algorithm with the best predicted performance is run for one generation, after which the performance is predicted again. The best algorithm runs for the next generation, and the process goes on. In this way, algorithms switch automatically as a function of the computational budget. This novel algorithm is named Multiple Evolutionary Algorithm (MultiEA). The predictor we introduced has the nice property of being parameter-less, and algorithms switch automatically as a function of budget. The following contributions are made: (1) experimental results on 24 benchmark functions show that MultiEA outperforms (i) Multialgorithm Genetically Adaptive Method for Single Objective Optimization (AMALGAM-SO); (ii) Population-based Algorithm Portfolio (PAP); (iii) a multiple algorithm approach which chooses an algorithm randomly (RandEA); and (iv) a multiple algorithm approach which divides the computational budget evenly and execute all algorithms in parallel (ExhEA). This shows that it outperforms existing portfolio approaches and the predictor is functioning well. (2) Moreover, a neck to neck comparison of MultiEA with CMA-ES, HdEA, PSO2011, and SaDE is also made. Experimental results show that the performance of MultiEA is very competitive. In particular, MultiEA, being a portfolio algorithm, is sometimes even better than all its individual algorithms, and has more robust performance. (3) Furthermore, a positive synergic effect is discovered, namely, MultiEA can sometimes perform better than the sum of its individual EAs. This gives interesting insights into why an algorithm portfolio is a good approach. (4) It is found that MultiEA scales as well as the best algorithm in the portfolio. This suggests that MultiEA scales up nicely, which is a desirable algorithmic feature. (5) Finally, the performance of MultiEA is investigated on a real world problem. It is found that MultiEA can select the most suitable algorithm for the problem and is much better than choosing algorithms randomly.",

In the Netherlands this transition was envisioned by the Transition Programme Long-term Care (2007–2010) as “a fundamental change towards a more human centred, affordable and socially embedded healthcare system”. One of the experiments in this programme was Neighbourhood Care (in Dutch “Buurtzorg”): small-scale, self-managed teams of nurses who provide high-quality homecare in neighbourhoods. This article looks at Buurtzorg from the perspective of transition studies, building on the framework of ‘deepening, broadening and scaling-up’ transition experiments. We analyse how Buurtzorg could rapidly develop from a local experiment to a network of more than 800 teams and also spread to different care domains and abroad. The rapid development of Buurtzorg is explained by identifying their strategic activities, the alignment of contextual factors and their strategic position as outsider towards the regime. We conclude that Buurtzorg has become a ‘symbol’ in a transformative movement that can contribute to a future transition in healthcare. This case study contributes to theoretical and practice-oriented knowledge on how a transition experiment in a social domain can surpass the experimental phase, identifying key strategic activities for niche-mainstreaming.",

abstract = "Coordination among multiple autonomous, distributed cognitive agents is one of the most challenging and ubiquitous problems in Distributed AI and its applications in general, and in collaborative multi-agent systems in particular. A particularly prominent problem in multi-agent coordination is that of group, team or coalition formation. A considerable majority of the approaches to this problem found in the literature assume fixed interactions among autonomous agents involved in the coalition formation process. Moreover, most of the prior research where agents are actually able to learn and adapt based on their past interactions mainly focuses on reinforcement learning techniques at the individual agent level. We argue that, in many important applications and contexts, complex large-scale collaborative multi-agent systems need to be able to learn and adapt at multiple organization, hierarchical and logical levels. In particular, the agents need to be able to learn both at the level of individual agents and at the system or agent ensemble levels, and then to integrate these different sources of learned knowledge and behavior, in order to be effective at solving complex tasks in typical dynamic, partially observable and noisy multi-agent environments. In this paper, we describe a conceptual framework for addressing the problem of learning how to coordinate effectively at three qualitatively distinct levels — those of (i) individual agents, (ii) small groups of agents, and (iii) very large agent ensembles (or alternatively, depending on the nature of a multi-agent system, at the system or central control level). We briefly illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed conceptual framework with an example of how it would apply to an important practical coordination problem, namely that of distributed coordination of a large ensemble of unmanned vehicles on a complex multi-task mission.",

For a better understanding of the adaptive capacity of an urban system, this paper integrated four types of sub-resilience across different domains into the comprehensive urban resilience. Then, a system dynamics (SD) model was established to clarify the causal feedback and dynamic interaction mechanism between the components of urban resilience. Taken the megacity of Beijing as the case, the improvement process of urban resilience was simulated by 2025, and four policy scenarios were set to improve the urban resilience effectively by adjusting endogenous variables. The results showed that the growth of urban resilience would undergo three periods: fast growth exceeded 10% in first two years, while slowed down afterwards in following five years, and finally increased again in the future. The sub-resilience that dominates the urban resilience growth changed from the material and energy resilience to the governance resilience, and then to the socio-economic resilience. Scenarios analysis indicated that all subsystems were sensitive to the policy adjustment except for the socio-economic component. The purpose of this paper is to build a comprehensive and informative resilience development tool for urban managers and planners to maintain the desired status of city operation, as well as respond positively to resilience crisis that might occur in the near future.",

An agent-based modeling approach is used to simulate opinion dynamics within a risk publics framework, which is based on the social amplification of risk and captures changes in perceptions about the risks and benefits of water reuse. The model is applied to simulate and project adoption of water reuse for the Town of Cary, North Carolina, using data about new water reclamation accounts and plans for infrastructure expansion. Performance of the agent-based model is compared with a cellular automata model for simulating historic data. Alternative infrastructure expansion schedules are simulated using the agent-based model to evaluate potable water savings and utilization of reclaimed water capacity, based on adoption projections.

From this perspective, the adaptive loop in complex organizations can be divided into four steps adapted from the OODA loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act). The extension of the OODA loop to an organizational scale is incorporated with an assumption that flow of information, involved in adaptation processes, can be formed by different organizational components. Subsequently, the OODA loop can be presented as a chain of actions created by independent components of both the organization and its environment. Applying this approach to complex organizations necessitates mapping a functional definition of different organizational components within each step of the adaptive loop. Thus, while the functional definition of an organization can be done by using existing tools of organizational analysis (organizational structure, functional decomposition, architecture frameworks, etc.), the main goal of this proposed methodology is the determination of adaptive loops on an organizational scale.",

abstract = "Currently, there is an increasing demand for user-adaptive systems for various purposes in many different domains. Typically, personalisation in information systems occurs separately within each system. The recent trends in user modeling rely on cross-system personalisation, i.e., the opportunity to share information across multiple information systems in order to improve user adaptation. Cooperation among systems in order to exchange user model knowledge is a complex task. This paper addresses a key challenge for cross-system personalisation which is often taken as a starting assumption, i.e., user identification. In this paper, we describe the conceptualization and implementation of a framework that provides a common base for user identification for cross-system personalisation among web-based user-adaptive systems. However, the framework can be easily adopted in different working environments and for different purposes. The framework represents a hybrid approach which draws parallels both from centralized and decentralized solutions for user modeling. To perform user identification, we propose to exploit a set of identification properties that are combined using an identification algorithm.",

Context-aware systems are able to change their behaviour depending on new conditions regarding the user, the platform and the environment. These systems are evolving towards interacting with the user in a transparent and ubiquitous manner, especially by means of different types of sensors, which can gather a wide range of data from the user, the platform the user is interacting with, and the environment where such interaction is taking place. It is worth noting that the software architecture of a system is a key artefact during its development and its adaptation process. Hence, the definition of the software architecture becomes essential while developing context-aware systems since it should reflect how the context is tackled for adaptation purposes. With the aim of studying this issue, we have designed and conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview about the different architectural approaches used in context-aware systems. One of the main findings of this study is that there are not many software architecture proposals that deal with context-awareness in an explicit way during the adaptation process. It was also detected that there are Human Computer Interaction (HCI) works that focus on context-aware adaptations but neglect partially or completely any possible change in the system architecture during the adaptation process. Due to this, we perceived a need to analyse what research works highlight the use of context and its relationship to the software architecture in existing context-aware systems. Therefore, this mapping study attempts to bridge the gap between Software Architecture and HCI in order to align the adaptation at the architectural level (changes in the configuration of architectural components) and at the HCI level (changes in the interaction modality or the user interface in general).",

We make out a case in support of developing a new overarching legal phenomenon that, more than environmental law (among others) comprehensively accommodates and encapsulates the juridical aspects of earth system governance, including a new accompanying research agenda. We call this new legal phenomenon ‘earth system law’. Earth system law, as we aim to show, could introduce a new era in legal scholarship, while seeking to comprehensively respond to the regulatory challenges presented by a changing Earth system in the Anthropocene. For illustrative purposes, we provide a conceptual framework of earth system law by focusing on international environmental law. We show how core considerations of earth system law might set in motion some of the conceptual and regulatory changes required to eventually progress from international environmental law to a mature form of earth system law.",

abstract = "Context
Service-Orientation (SO) is a rapidly emerging paradigm for the design and development of adaptive and dynamic software systems. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has also gained attention as a promising and successful software reuse development paradigm over the last decade and proven to provide effective solutions to deal with managing the growing complexity of software systems.
Objective
This study aims at characterizing and identifying the existing research on employing and leveraging SO and SPLE.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze related literature. We identified 81 primary studies, dated from 2000–2011 and classified them with respect to research focus, types of research and contribution.
Result
The mapping synthesizes the available evidence about combining the synergy points and integration of SO and SPLE. The analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on service variability modeling and adaptive systems by employing SPLE principles and approaches. In particular, SPLE approaches, especially feature-oriented approaches for variability modeling, have been applied to the design and development of service-oriented systems. While SO is employed in software product line contexts for the realization of product lines to reconcile the flexibility, scalability and dynamism in product derivations thereby creating dynamic software product lines.
Conclusion
Our study summarizes and characterizes the SO and SPLE topics researchers have investigated over the past decade and identifies promising research directions as due to the synergy generated by integrating methods and techniques from these two areas.",

The model tames the inherent complexity of the task by a recursive notion of modularity which makes each module both a controller and a controlled entity. Modules are arranged along part-whole tree-like hierarchies which collectively constitute the system. The behaviour of each module is strictly local since it has visibility only on its controlled modules, but not on the module which controls it. Each behaviour can be thus checked locally at design time against safety and liveness formulas, which still hold when component holons are composed into more complex ones, thus contributing, without the need of additional checks, to the overall safety and liveness of the final system.",

Mandelbrot's early studies of economics and financial time series data, which provided many of the insights for his conception of fractals, are reviewed in terms of their challenges to the conceptual framework of the traditonal capital markets research paradigm and its extension to financial reporting issues. Contemporary studies which are reviving Mandelbrot's challenges are also reviewed, with the conclusion that they are weakening the intellectual hold of the tradtional capital markets paradigm and making it more susceptible to overthrow by a competing paradigm. Finally, an emerging new research program associated with the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) is reviewed. SFI researchers are studying financial markets as complex adaptive systems. Their preliminary findings are incompatible with the widely presumed theoretical linkage between financial reporting systems and economic efficiency, and they tend to undermine the traditonal rationale relating earnings to stock prices.",

Recent data show that following the reorganization of the Late Preclassic period, Tikal experienced an extended period of technological innovation and population growth that eventually stretched the carrying capacity of the available landscape. A hydraulic system was constructed that provided water for the community during the dry seasons: a powerful development in an area without a permanent water source. Agriculture was intensified using a combination of root crop agriculture, irrigated fields, arboriculture, household gardens, short fallow cropping systems and bajo margin cultivation. The net product of these diverse production activities helped to underwrite an enormous amassing of economic and political capital during the Late Classic period. Ultimately, in the mid-9th century CE, expansive growth combined with multiple system disturbances led to a collapse of the city’s social structure followed by abandonment of the site. The application of resilience theory as a conceptual framework is useful in helping to interpret the complex web of the underlying social and ecological domains that contributed to Tikal’s demise.",

It presents, through a series of four propositions, a three-stage supply network typology to help scholars and managers consider how best to develop these innovations. This typology was constructed by reviewing existing sustainability frameworks that argued that innovation was a key factor in sustainability. Moreover we found little consideration given on how to discover and develop eco-innovations. The literature proposes that a firm with strong ties with a few strategic suppliers will benefit from the knowledge and technology that spills over from suppliers to the firm during the new product development process. In contrast, the network literature explains that the creation of multiple weak ties to non-strategic suppliers may increase opportunities for identifying innovation. The network literature further suggests a third and potentially more promising route: building weak ties to suppliers that bridge ‘structural holes’ in the network. We suggest that strong ties with strategic suppliers will lead to the development of incremental eco-innovations while weak ties with multiple suppliers and with suppliers that bridge structural holes will tend to lead to radical eco-innovations. Finally, we suggest that once eco-innovations are developed they should be embedded in the operational processes of other suppliers to increase the sustainability performance of the focal firm.",

Yet the approach based on the ontological primacy of stable and often hierarchical structures is still prevalent in theoretical and, most importantly, practical thinking about social systems. We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing social system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive processes in the evolution of a system. The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system – an ecology of interacting social subsystems – each of which is also a living cognitive system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.",

Water, as a critical component of social-environmental systems, has historically been managed in a way that prioritizes water supply and flood control; some side-effects include stressed ecosystems, water quality declines, and inequitable access to water. The pervasive nature of water issues, both emerging and persistent, reiterate the need for systematization of knowledge and re-envisioning of place-based planning and management of water systems. Here we develop a new conceptual framework for Water Resources Stewardship (WRS) with a focus on equitable and adaptive solutions under changing conditions. This framework organizes and fortifies existing knowledge on this topic and presents a systems-level view. A thematic analysis of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) based on published case studies is used to: (a) appraise elements of the WRS approach, and (b) identify opportunities for integration of a stewardship approach. WRS offers an adaptive and equitable approach that embraces risk-based approaches to steward water systems within an uncertain and changing environment.",

The study and practice of medicine could benefit from an enhanced engagement with the new perspectives provided by the emerging areas of complexity science and systems biology. A more integrated, systemic approach is needed to fully understand the processes of health, disease, and dysfunction, and the many challenges in medical research and education. Integral to this approach is the search for a quantitative, predictive, multilevel, theoretical conceptual framework that both complements the present approaches and stimulates a more integrated research agenda that will lead to novel questions and experimental programmes. As examples, the importance of network structures and scaling laws are discussed for the development of a broad, quantitative, mathematical understanding of issues that are important in health, including ageing and mortality, sleep, growth, circulatory systems, and drug doses. A common theme is the importance of understanding the quantifiable determinants of the baseline scale of life, and developing corresponding parameters that define the average, idealised, healthy individual.",

As cities are still growing in terms of physical size, number of inhabitants and total energy consumption, unique challenges present themselves in order to safeguard a healthy urban living environment, while preventing resource shortages and pollution. The concept of urban metabolism may contribute to sustainable growth of cities as it can be used to understand emergent patterns in flows of energy and materials in the urban environment. The concept of urban metabolism draws upon an analogy with the biological meaning of metabolism, as it occurs in organisms and ecosystems. Here we present a review of the interpretation of urban metabolism in the context of urban energy dynamics and assess the validity of the proposed analogy with biology. Based on this analogy, we propose a conceptual framework for the role of urban metabolism in urban energy systems. Our review highlights that urban energy systems show a hierarchical organization comparable to ecological systems. However, the emergent patterns that result from the dynamics within urban systems differ from those occurring within ecological systems. We suggest that, in contrast to biological systems, urban energy systems lack energetic constraints at the lowest level of organisation that could enable the resource-efficient regulation of energy requirements at larger scales. The proposed framework highlights that low-level resource supply regulations may contribute to introduce scale-dependent relationships that increase energy use efficiency as cities grow.",

abstract = "Background
Collaborative cyber-physical systems form highly dynamic networks, consisting of collaborating individual systems at run-time. These networks provide functionality that goes beyond the functionality of the individual systems that are part of the network. The availability of such collaborative functionalities depends not only on the individual systems’ behaviors but also on the current morphology of the network (i.e., the architecture of the overall network that defines what kind of systems and how many systems are actually partaking in the collaboration at that moment).
Aims
It is of importance to thoroughly consider the possible morphologies of the network of cyber-physical systems during the development of the individual systems as these are sources for requirements as well as design decisions. These requirements and design decisions must be associated to the particular morphologies they are applicable to in order to ensure traceability and comprehensibility between the morphology of the network of cyber-physical systems and the individual systems. Hence, we aim at defining an orthogonal model which allows to document dynamicity constraints and therefore restrain the potential morphologies a network can take.
Method
This paper contributes results from an exploratory case study conducted in the industry automation domain. In the case study, an existing variability modeling approach was applied to the development of a network of autonomous transport robots.
Results
Based on the variability modeling approach an orthogonal dynamicity constrained model was defined and evolved to fit industry's needs.
Conclusions
Results show that the use of an orthogonal model for dynamicity constraints can improve the development of cyber-physical systems designed to participate in collaborative networks.",

A number of enterprise modeling frameworks have been developed providing models, methods and tools that enable to communicate the structure and processes of organizations. These frameworks have been used both for systems development and organizational analysis ends, where the latter mainly focuses process (re)design efforts. We argue that enterprise modeling frameworks can be used for other kinds of organizational analysis. In particular, they can be used to capture and model work practices, human multitasking at work, and to compare models describing pre-defined behavior with actual execution. However, current enterprise modeling frameworks have several limitations in modeling human agents. First, these frameworks model generic behavior rather than behavior of specific individuals or groups. Second, they do not acknowledge the complex, situated and adaptive nature of human behavior. Third, these frameworks provide ‘aerial’ representations that ignore the process required to align the different and inconsistent views that human agents frequently have of the organization. In this paper we (1) argue the importance of an agent perspective to align individual and collective views of the organization; (2) describe an ontology of organizational agents and contexts to overcome current limitations in modeling human agents; and (3) show the ontology benefits for organizational analysis ends, with results from case studies in real organizational settings. The ontology is part of a broader conceptual framework for the alignment between individuals and organizations, and provides an agent-centric and ‘context-aware’ perspective of the organization complementary to existing perspectives of enterprise modeling frameworks.",

abstract = "Fuzzy information granules indicate sufficiently interpretable fuzzy sets for achieving a high level of human cognitive abstraction. Furthermore, granularity, complexity, and accuracy are associated with fuzzy information granules. Measuring granularity is a promising means of verifying the effectiveness of the fuzzy granular model. Higher granularity indicates fine partitions, whereas coarser partitions suggest lower granularity. Therefore, accuracy is directly proportional to the granularity, such that, the higher the granularity, the more accurate and more complex the model is. Consequently, the granularity-simplicity tradeoff is also a significant criterion in considering the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff. This paper thoroughly reviews diverse ideas to understand the fuzzy information granule and addresses a sensible compromise between interpretability-accuracy and granularity-simplicity. Those requirements contradict each other, thus certain conceptual and mathematical considerations are necessary in designing a granular framework. Moreover, a double axis taxonomy is introduced in this paper: “complexity-based granularity versus semantic-based granularity” (which considers granularity measures) and “granular partition level versus granular rule base level” (regarding knowledge base stages). However, several constraints should be considered in designing a granular framework such as the granularity-accuracy dilemma, the overfitting/underfitting situation, the granular rule base level conflict, the interpretability constraint threshold, the stability-plasticity dilemma, and the parameter optimization. This paper primarily aims to present a conceptual framework to better understand existing methods, as well as how these methods can inspire future research.",

As a cohort of interdisciplinary scholars, we navigate the boundary between science and practice to address the question of fit regarding the role of organizations in transcending boundaries. We found there is a need to rectify discrepancies between theories about boundaries and theories about organizations. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework to analyze transboundary organizations, an umbrella term to group the literature on boundary organizations, intermediaries and bridging organizations; we introduce this term to illustrate they are not mutually exclusive and to facilitate interdisciplinary research. We first examine social-ecological systems (SES), a framework intended to improve understandings of boundaries and governance. We then continue to unpack the complexity of boundaries and organizations, specifically through important transboundary concepts such as scale and organizational learning. This helps frame our examination of the literature on: 1) boundary organizations; 2) bridging organizations (third-party entities); and 3) intermediaries (distinguished by their position between other actors). Our review identifies a number of discrepancies that pertain to the types of boundaries discussed and the roles assigned to organizations governing SES. Important characteristics have emerged from our review of transboundary organizations including legitimacy, saliency, urgency, and credibility. In developing a conceptual framework, we argue that transboundary organizations: 1) expand upon the boundary spectrum, 2) incorporate transboundary concepts, and 3) hybridize characteristics of boundary, bridging, and intermediary organizations. We conclude with a number of considerations for transboundary organizations and recommendations for further research.",

abstract = "Objective
To develop a conceptual framework, SEWA, to address challenges of studying workarounds emerging from Electronic Health Record (EHR) system usage.
Materials and methods
SEWA is based on direct observations and follow-up interviews with physicians, nurses and clerks using their EHR at a large academic hospital. SEWA was developed by an iterative process: each new version was reviewed by experts (case study participants, hospital management, EHR developers) and refined accordingly till deemed final.
Results
SEWA defines the work system and its five components constituting the context in which EHR workarounds are created. It also contains 15 rationales for creating EHR workarounds. Furthermore, four attributes are included that define EHR workarounds: cascadedness, anticipatedness, avoidability, and repetitiveness. Finally, SEWA lists the possible effects of workarounds on outcomes of clinical processes in terms of scope and impact.
Discussion
SEWA provides a grounded foundation for performing sociotechnical analyses of EHR workarounds based on components of the work system. SEWA can likewise be supportive in planning redesign efforts of the work system. Finally, workarounds are subject to gradual change caused by e.g. changes in one’s knowledge of the EHR, hospital policies, care directives, and system updates. Snapshots of SEWA can be taken over time and compared to gain insights into the evolution of workarounds.
Conclusion
Given the absence of a sociotechnical framework to study EHR workarounds, SEWA could aid researchers and practitioners to identify, analyze and resolve workarounds, and thereby contribute to improved patient safety, effectiveness of care and efficiency of care.",

AT is used to understand the relationships between a system, its stakeholders, and the system’s evolving context. The User Requirements Notation (URN) is used to produce rigorous, analyzable specifications combining goal and scenario models. First, an AT language was developed constraining the framework for automation, second consistency heuristics were developed for constructing and analyzing combined AT/URN models, third a combined AT/URN methodology was developed, and consequently applied to a proof-of-concept system.
Results
An AT language with limited tool support was developed, as was a combined AT/URN methodology. This methodology was applied to an evolving disease management system to demonstrate the feasibility of adapting AT for use in system development with existing methodologies and tools. Bi-directional transformations between the languages allow proposed changes in system design to be propagated to AT models for use in stakeholder discussions regarding system evolution.
Conclusions
The AT framework can be constrained for use in requirements elicitation and combined with URN tools to provide system designs that include social system perspectives. The developed AT/URN methodology can help engineers to track the impact on system design due to requirement changes triggered by changes in the system’s social context. The methodology also allows engineers to assess the impact of proposed system design changes on the social elements of the system context.",

This review provides a framework which combines functional social-institutional capacities with basin biophysical indicators in a diagnostic tool to determine RBO governance performance. Each of these two capacities are represented by four groups of indicators respectively covering social learning capacity and biophysical capacity. The distance and alignment between capacity and measure of performance scores can be used to prioritise program planning and resource allocation for improving river basin governance, and to undertake periodic evaluations as part of a trajectory analysis. The diagnostic functional framework provides tangible indicators of performance around key concepts in river basin governance. It offers a first attempt to strengthen the position and effectiveness of an RBO in dealing with complex adaptive systems.",

This study aims to explore the influencing factors and the dynamic evolution of CIER. A combined decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory interpretative structural modeling method (DEMATEL-ISM) is adopted to illustrate the intricate hierarchical relationships among influencing factors. Moreover, a dynamic model based on stochastic differential equations is proposed to demonstrate the evolutionary path of CIER under random economic shocks scenario. The results are as follows. First, 17 influencing factors of CIER are identified from four dimensions of system, industry, enterprise and government management, their hierarchical pattern is classified into three levels, i.e. direct factors, intermediary factors, and fundamental factors. Second, through the constructed evolution model of CIER to economic shocks, a numerical simulation is conducted in the case of Datong coal mining area, whose findings are that the development level of CIER and influencing mechanism of various factors are both different, it is necessary to accurately determine the evolution phase of CIER and control the corresponding key influencing factors to effectively improve resilience standing up to random economic shocks. Some policy implications are proposed to offer valuable references for resilience building and enhancement. The findings are helpful to researchers and practitioners to focus their efforts toward promoting the sustainable development of the coal industry ecosystem in the face of macroeconomic shocks.",

The socio–economic water cycling system is a complex adaptive system. Changes in the socio-economic system at the macro level, such as industrial transformation, technical progress, and water price reform, will have impacts on water resources utilization at the micro level. In this study, we applied the multi-region computable general equilibrium theory to build a multiple-scale socio–economic water cycling (SEWC) model for analyzing the impacts of water price reform, water reallocation schemes, and industrialization processes on water resources utilization, with particular attention being placed on the water–land nexus. Importantly, the key parameters for constructing this multiple-scale SEWC model, such as the relationships between water and land resources, vary spatially across multiple levels (i.e., the levels of river basin, county, and irrigation area). We therefore innovatively considered and estimated the key parameters firstly and then integrated them into the model to achieve more reliable simulation results. Taking the Heihe River Basin as an empirical example, the simulated results show that a 5% increase in both the surface water price and the groundwater price in Gaotai County would lead to a differing extent of the economic impact among the other counties. Consequently, an appropriate allocation scheme of water resources according to the levels of irrigation area, county, and the Heihe River Basin is imperative if water utilization pressure is to be mitigated within the entire river basin.",

This new perspective, encompassing strategies for social action with grass roots participation including technology adoption programs and a strong component of moral leadership may contribute to turn ICT into successful development engines.

The dynamic consequences of OI, for both OS and PL, are studied using a complex adaptive systems approach. We examine how profits, technology levels, R&D investment, technology adoption and market structure evolve under each and are impacted by underlying market characteristics. While both OS and PL are found to be equivalent in technology outcomes, OS comes with additional advantages to participating firms. Firms in the OS framework earn higher profit and are more efficient with their R&D investments. The industry is less concentrated under OS than under PL, except when market size is very large. In both frameworks, consumer preference for new product adoption has a significant impact. When consumers adopt newly introduced products relatively quickly, market concentration is the higher and overall rate of technological progress slower. These results contribute towards a deeper theoretical understanding of OI, opening new avenues for future research.",

abstract = "A supply chain is a complex stochastic adaptive system featuring dynamics, uncertainty, and partial information sharing. Though agent-based discrete event simulation is a more efficient method of handling those features than the traditional analytical methods, agent-based modeling and simulation of supply chain requires the integration of a mature modeling and simulation theory, an excellent modeling framework, and a special simulation platform. This paper proposes an integrated framework for agent-based inventory–production–transportation modeling and distributed simulation of supply chains. This paper’s multi-level framework comprises four levels—from domain modeling to the implementation of multi-agent systems—and integrates the agent-based modeling and distributed simulation theory, a four-layered conceptual agent modeling framework, a meta-agent class library, and a multi-agent based distributed simulation platform to build an agent-based inventory–production–transportation model and simulate it in a distributed way. It extends the conceptual modeling framework. This extended framework provides users with a meta-agent class library and a multi-agent based distributed platform for supply chains with which to build an agent-based simulation model visually and rapidly by using meta-agents as building blocks. Further, it supports the independent building of sub-simulation models, implementing and synchronizing them together in a distributed environment. Therefore, the proposed integrated framework has strong flexibility in multiple layers, multiple granularities, reusability, and scalability in simulation modeling. A two-echelon supply chain is modeled and simulated to illustrate the proposed integrated framework.",

Different to previous studies, we are not assuming the curve shape of the electricity use and economy in advance. A flexibly piecewise spline model is employed rather than the commonly used linear, quadratic, cubic polynomial or S shape saturation curve model. We capture an inverted-U relationship, and the turning point is at about $20,000 (purchasing power parity, 2005 constant price). This pattern is robust in the sense that it is not sensitive to eliminating any special countries or to alternative model specifications.

This shift is driven largely by the limited efficacy of current immunosuppression protocols which primarily target T cells in preventing chronic graft loss, as well as by the rapid advance of basic sciences in the realm of innate immunity. In fact, the innate immune cells have emerged as key players in the allograft response in various models, contributing to both graft rejection and graft acceptance. Here, we focus on the macrophages, highlighting their diversity, plasticity and emerging features in transplant models, as well as recent developments in our studies of diverse subsets of macrophages. We also discuss challenges, unsolved questions, and emerging approaches in therapeutically modulating macrophages in further improvement of transplant outcomes.",

In Software Engineering (SE), conference publications have high importance both in effective communication and in academic careers. Researchers actively discuss how a paper should be organized to be accepted in mainstream conferences.
Aiming
This work tackles the problem of generalizing and characterizing the type of papers accepted at SE conferences.
Method
The paper offers a new perspective in the analysis of SE literature: a categorization scheme for SE papers is obtained by merging, extending and revising related proposals from a few existing studies. The categorization scheme is used to classify the papers accepted at three top-tier SE conferences during five years (2012–2016).
Results
While a broader experience is certainly needed for validation and fine-tuning, preliminary outcomes can be observed relative to what problems and topics are addressed, what types of contributions are presented and how they are validated.
Conclusions
The results provide insights to paper writers, paper reviewers and conference organizers in focusing their future efforts, without any intent to provide judgments or authoritative guidelines.",

However, Multiagent Systems (MASs) are still not widely adopted in industry owing to the lack of a connection between MAS and software engineering. Since 2000, there is an effort to bridge this gap and to produce software engineering techniques for agent-based systems that guide the processes of design, development and maintenance. In Brazil, Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) was first investigated by the research group in the Software Engineering Laboratory (LES) at PUC-Rio, which after one decade of study in this area has built an AOSE community. This paper presents the history of AOSE at LES by discussing the sub-areas of MAS Software Engineering research and development that have been focus of the LES research group. We give examples of relevant results and present a subset of the extensive literature the group has produced during the last decade. We also report how we faced the challenges that emerged from our research by organizing and developing a research community at the intersection of software engineering, programming and MASs with a concern for scalability of solutions.",

Although most agricultural producers respond rapidly to changes in their external environment, science needs to play an important, partial role in instigating adaptation actions that go beyond the ongoing, experience-based response process. This requires well-structured, conceptual frameworks that connect science with action. These frameworks must also ensure that the scientific input into the adaptation process remains salient, credible and legitimate. For the field of agriculture and environmental sciences we review the urgency and the theoretical basis for such engagement processes. On the basis of this we propose an adaptation cycle that first, provides a reflective analysis-action continuum; second, ensures broad-based scientific input and feedback; and third, helps to increase the adaptive capacity of everyone involved (including farmers, policy-makers and scientists).",

Some who write on this topic suggest that complexity theory will lead to a unifying understanding of complex phenomena; others dismiss it as a passing and disruptive fad. We suggest that for the analysis of coupled natural/human systems, the truth emerges from the middle ground. As an approach focused as much on the connections among system elements as the elements themselves, we argue that complexity theory provides a useful conceptual framework for the study of coupled natural/human systems. It is, if nothing else, a framework that leads us to ask interesting questions about, for example, sustainability, resilience, threshold events, and predictability. In this paper we attempt to demystify the ongoing discussions on complexity theory by linking its evocative and overloaded terminology to real-world processes. We illustrate how a shift in focus from system elements to connections among elements can lead to meaningful insight into human–environment interactions that might otherwise be overlooked. We ground our discussion in ongoing interdisciplinary research surrounding Yellowstone National Park’s northern elk winter range; a tightly coupled natural/human system that has been the center of debate, conflict, and compromise for more than 135 years.",

The complicated nature of cloud computing encompassing internet-based technologies and service models for delivering IT applications, processing capability, storage, and memory space brings along challenging problems. Some issues such as information security, privacy, and legal aspects of cloud computing may become challenging while cross passing with another complex domain like healthcare.
Objectives
The present study was conducted to report the results of a systematic literature review on the legal aspects of health cloud.
Method
The original English papers published in Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Digital Library databases were extracted, among which1582 were related to the legal aspects of health cloud environment and were selected using predefined search strings.
Conclusion
Through the review process, effective factors in relation to a health cloud legal framework were identified and accordingly, a proper design was developed for this domain. Next, the identified factors were confirmed and adjusted by mapping the contents of the selected papers to different categories and subcategories under the proposed framework. Five Main categories like the issues related to the compliance, data protection, Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM), ownership, and quality of service were selected as the basic pillars in the proposed framework. Finally, 22 papers were selected, among which 19 were mapped to the compliance issues, 18 the issues related to “Data protection” were addressed, and 14 “Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM)” was discussed. Fifteen Papers were mapped to “Data ownership” and “Quality of service” categories. Some papers were found to present some solutions in all the mentioned areas; however, most of them have addressed only a few issues.",

This research develops an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household-level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands. The ABM is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table. The framework is applied to explore trade-offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin-level. A group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in Verde River Basin, Arizona. The framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user, municipal, and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long-term water resilience.",

abstract = "The ‘Anthropocene’ concept provides a conceptual framework that encapsulates the current global situation in which society has an ever-greater dominating influence on Earth System functioning. Simulation models used to understand earth system dynamics provide early warning, scenario analysis and evaluation of environmental management and policies. This paper aims to assess the extent to which current models represent the Anthropocene and suggest ways forward. Current models do not fully reflect the typical characteristics of the Anthropocene, such as societal influences and interactions with natural processes, feedbacks and system dynamics, tele-connections, tipping points, thresholds and regime shifts. Based on an analysis of current model representations of Anthropocene dynamics, we identify ways to enhance the role of modeling tools to better help us understand Anthropocene dynamics and address sustainability issues arising from them. To explore sustainable futures (‘safe and operating spaces’), social processes and anthropogenic drivers of biophysical processes must be incorporated, to allow for a spectrum of potential impacts and responses at different societal levels. In this context, model development can play a major role in reconciling the different epistemologies of the disciplines that need to collaborate to capture changes in the functioning of socio-ecological systems. Feedbacks between system functioning and underlying endogenous drivers should be represented, rather than assuming the drivers to be exogenous to the modelled system or stationary in time and space. While global scale assessments are important, the global scale dynamics need to be connected to local realities and vice versa. The diversity of stakeholders and potential questions requires a diversification of models, avoiding the convergence towards single models that are able to answer a wide range of questions, but without sufficient specificity. The novel concept of the Anthropocene can help to develop innovative model representations and model architectures that are better suited to assist in designing sustainable solutions targeted at the users of the models and model results.",

The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on the evolution and current status of research into temporal variation impacts on human task performance.
Methods
This review details the findings from a systematic review of peer reviewed literature identified via keyword searches in ISI Web of Science, Engineering Village Compendex, IEEE Explore, PsycINFO, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) online, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and Google Scholar. Proceeding articles, peer reviewed journals, cited grey literature, and government technical reports relevant to temporal variability in human performance were identified and used in this review. Both statistical and contents analysis were conducted in this paper.
Results
Results suggest that the current state of research in human temporal variability is evolving but still has shortcomings in terms of integrating all aspects of interplay between the physical and cognitive components of human response. In light of this, research supporting the sustained development and use of refined cognitive-physical models is gaining momentum and sensible efforts to use task analysis tools that provide integration of both the cognitive and physical components of human response are underway.
Conclusions
This article identifies that although considerable advancements have been made in understanding the temporal variability of human performance, substantial research regarding the factors affecting it, their impacts, and the practical implications are still required.
Originality/value
This study is unique in both the breadth and range of literature considered regarding the factors affecting temporal variability in human performance as well as their implications. Successful consideration of these elements in human-centered complex adaptive systems establishes mechanisms for efficient and effective manpower and risk mitigation planning.",

At the same time, prominent conceptual frameworks of socio-technical transitions that address these elements are often found to be difficult to operationalize in quantitative energy analyses that meet policy development requirements. However a new energy modelling paradigm has started to emerge for integrating both quantitative modelling and conceptual socio-technical transitions. This paper provides a taxonomy for this new model category: ‘socio-technical energy transition’ (STET) models. A review of existing STET models and their applications to the energy supply, buildings and transport sectors is provided. Following this review, the paper reflects on the extent to which these existing quantitative models captured the variety of factors covered in socio-technical transitions theory, highlights the challenges associated with their theoretical and behavioural validation, and proposes future development priorities for STET models.",

Subsequently, I set out the methodological arguments in favor and against conceptual vagueness. While traditional philosophy of science emphasizes precision and conceptual clarity as precondition for empirical science, alternative views highlight vagueness as fuel for creative and pragmatic problem-solving. Reviewing this discussion, I argue that a trade-off between vagueness and precision exists, which is to be solved differently depending on the research context. In some contexts research benefits from conceptual vagueness while in others it depends on precision. Assessing the specific example of “resilience thinking” in detail, I propose a restructuring of the conceptual framework which explicitly distinguishes descriptive, evaluative and transformative aspects.",

This work reviews the recent advances in tongue diagnosis, which is a significant constituent of traditional oriental medicinal technology, and explores the literature to evaluate the works done on the various aspects of computerized tongue diagnosis, namely preprocessing, tongue detection, segmentation, feature extraction, tongue analysis, especially in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In spite of huge volume of work done on automatic tongue diagnosis (ATD), there is a lack of adequate survey, especially to combine it with the current diagnosis trends. This paper studies the merits, capabilities, and associated research gaps in current works on ATD systems. After exploring the algorithms used in tongue diagnosis, the current trend and global requirements in health domain motivates us to propose a conceptual framework for the automated tongue diagnostic system on mobile enabled platform. This framework will be able to connect tongue diagnosis with the future point-of-care health system.",

abstract = "Economic evaluations are analytic techniques to assess the relative costs and consequences of health care programmes and technologies. Their role is to provide rigorous data to inform the health care decision-making process. Economic evaluation may oversimplify complex health care decisions. These analyses often ignore important health consequences, contextual elements, relationships or other relevant modifying factors, which might not be appropriate in a multi-objective, multi-stakeholder issue. One solution would be to develop a new paradigm based on the issues of perspective and context. Complexity theory may provide a useful conceptual framework for economic evaluation in health care. Complexity thinking develops an awareness of issues including uncertainty, contextual issues, multiple perspectives, broader societal involvement, and transdisciplinarity. This points the economic evaluation field towards an accountability and epistemology based on pluralism and uncertainty, requiring new forms of lay-expert engagement and roles of lay knowledge into decision-making processes. This highlights the issue of reflexivity in economic evaluation in health care. A reflexive approach would allow economic evaluators to analyze how objective structures and subjective elements influence their practices. In return, this would point increase the integrity and reliability of economic evaluations. Reflexivity provides opportunities for critically thinking about the organization and activities of the intellectual field, and perhaps the potential of moving in new, creative directions. This paper argues for economic evaluators to have a less positivist attitude towards what is useful knowledge, and to use more imagination about the data and methodologies they use.",

Such networks are found in a variety of applications such as in supply chain networks, computer and communication networks, metabolic networks, food webs, etc. Here, we present a theory of self-organization by evolutionary adaptation in which we show how the structure and organization of a network is related to the survival, or in general the performance, objectives of the system. We propose that a complex system optimizes its network structure in order to maximize its overall survival fitness which is composed of short- and long-term survival components. These in turn depend on three critical measures of the network, namely, efficiency, robustness and cost, and the environmental selection pressure. Fitness maximization by adaptation leads to the spontaneous emergence of optimal network structures, both power law and non-power law, of various topologies depending on the selection pressure. Using a graph theoretical case study, we show that when efficiency is paramount the “star” topology emerges and when robustness is important the “circle” topology is found. When efficiency and robustness requirements are both important to varying degrees, other classes of networks such as the “hub” emerge. This theory provides a general conceptual framework for integrating survival or performance objectives, environmental or selection pressure, evolutionary adaptation, optimization of performance measures and topological features in a single coherent formalism. Our assumptions and results are consistent with observations across a wide variety of applications. This framework lays the ground work for a novel approach to model, design and analyze complex networks, both natural and artificial, such as metabolic pathways, supply chains and communication networks.",

It draws on concepts from national innovation systems (NIS), complexity, ecosystems, and social entrepreneurship research to develop a framework for forming innovation ecosystems via social entrepreneurship. The framework is especially relevant for new market creation in renewable energy for rural and bottom of the pyramid (BOP) populations. Case studies from the renewable energy sector in India support the framework. The paper suggests that creating a robust innovation ecosystem requires the following mechanisms at the national level to provide the supporting infrastructure: (1) creation of new institutions; (2) policies to generate demand; (3) institutional support for linkages to build capabilities. Key mechanisms at the micro-level include: (1) facilitating the entry of social entrepreneurs to serve the needs of rural populations; (2) use of new technology platforms to diffuse entrepreneurial skills and enhance community interactions; and (3) establishing linkages with external organizations to enable resource acquisition.",

abstract = "The energy, water and food (EWF) nexus modelling and analysis frameworks proposed recently have demonstrated their effectiveness in the assessment and quantification of synergies and trade-offs in the interlinkages between the three sectors. They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates “algorithmic resilience thinking” to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions.",

Among the different challenges OEMs (i.e. the vehicle manufacturers) are facing, vehicles are evolving into systems of systems. In fact, over the last years vehicles have evolved from disconnected and “blind” systems to systems that are (i) able to sense the surrounding environment and (ii) connected with other vehicles, the city, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. Future transportation systems can be seen as a System of Systems (SoS). In an SoS, constituent systems, i.e. the units that compose an SoS, can act as standalone systems, but their cooperation enables new emerging and promising scenarios. While this trend creates new opportunities, it also poses a risk to compromise key qualities such as safety, security, and privacy. In this paper we focus on the automotive domain and we investigate how to engineer and architect cars in order to build them as constituents of future transportation systems. Our contribution is an architectural viewpoint for System of Systems, which we demonstrate based on an automotive example. Moreover, we contribute a functional reference architecture for cars as constituents of an SoS. This reference architecture can be considered as an imprinting for the implementations that would be devised in specific projects and contexts. We also point out the necessity for a collaboration among different OEMs and with other relevant stakeholders, such as road authorities and smart cities, to properly engineer systems of systems composed of cars, trucks, roads, pedestrians, etc. This work is realized in the context of two Swedish projects coordinated by Volvo Cars and involving some universities and research centers in Sweden and many suppliers of the OEM, including Autoliv, Arccore, Combitech, Cybercom, Knowit, Prevas, ÅF-Technology, Semcom, and Qamcom.",

Urban policy makers must routinely deal with both detail and dynamic complexity, coupled with high levels of diversity, uncertainty and contingency. In such circumstances, it is difficult to generate reliable predictions of health-policy outcomes. In this paper we explore the potential for low-order system dynamics (LOSD) models to make a contribution towards meeting this challenge. By definition, LOSD models have few state variables (≤5), illustrate the non-linear effects caused by feedback and accumulation, and focus on endogenous dynamics generated within well-defined boundaries. We suggest that experience with LOSD models can help practitioners to develop an understanding of basic principles of system dynamics, giving them the ability to ‘see with new eyes’. Because efforts to build a set of LOSD models can help a transdisciplinary group to develop a shared, coherent view of the problems that they seek to tackle, such models can also become the foundations of ‘powerful ideas’. Powerful ideas are conceptual metaphors that provide the members of a policy-making group with the a priori shared context required for effective communication, the co-production of knowledge, and the collaborative development of effective public health policies.",

In China, land use policies have evidently influenced rural resilience. We conduct a co-citation analysis, especially the visualization of co-citation networks and research clusters, using CiteSpace 4.0.R5. Based on the analysis and literature review, we develop an assessment index system comprising four types of resilience – engineering, ecological, economic and social – to evaluate the changes in rural resilience resulting from a policy to develop a withdrawal mechanism for rural homesteads (WMRH). Our findings indicate that rural resilience in Guangzhou, Chongqing and Wuxi, selected as the study areas, increased by 123%, 61% and 88% respectively after the implementation of the policy. The main causes of these variations in changes in rural resilience are attributed to the diverse economic development modes in the different regions, as well as differing degrees of land market development and government regulation. Overall, the implementation of a WMRH, accompanied by a strong market and government regulation, is found to be optimal for enhancing rural resilience. We conclude that improving rural resilience involves appropriate government regulations as well as simply paying attention to the effects of the market on the optimal allocation of resources.",

The lack of social data relating to human-nature interactions in this particular context is now seen as an omission, which can often erode the efficacy of any resource management or conservation action. There have been repeated calls for a transdisciplinary approach to complex SESs that incorporates resilience, complexity science characterized by intricate feedback interactions, emergent processes, non-linear dynamics and uncertainty. To achieve this vision, we need to embrace diverse research methodologies that incorporate ecology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics and other disciplines that are anchored in empirical data. We conclude that to make SES research most useful in adding practical value to conservation planning, marine resource management planning processes and implementation, and the integration of resilience thinking into adaptation strategies, more research is needed on (1) understanding social-ecological landscapes and seascapes and patterns that would ensure planning process legitimacy, (2) costs of transformation (financial, social, environmental) to a stable resilient social-ecological system, (3) overcoming place-based data collection challenges as well as modeling challenges.",

abstract = "Agricultural innovation systems (AIS) are increasingly recognized as complex adaptive systems in which interventions cannot be expected to create predictable, linear impacts. Nevertheless, the logic models and theory of change (ToC) used by standard-setting international agricultural research agencies and donors assume that agricultural research will create impact through a predictable linear adoption pathway which largely ignores the complexity dynamics of AIS, and which misses important alternate pathways through which agricultural research can improve system performance and generate sustainable development impact. Despite a growing body of literature calling for more dynamic, flexible and “complexity-aware” approaches to monitoring and evaluation, few concrete examples exist of ToC that takes complexity dynamics within AIS into account, or provide guidance on how such theories could be developed. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an example of how an empirically-grounded, complexity-aware ToC can be developed and what such a model might look like in the context of a particular type of program intervention. Two detailed case studies are presented from an agricultural research program which was explicitly seeking to work in a “complexity-aware” way within aquatic agricultural systems in Zambia and the Philippines. Through an analysis of the outcomes of these interventions, the pathways through which they began to produce impacts, and the causal factors at play, we derive a “complexity-aware” ToC to model how the cases worked. This middle-range model, as well as an overarching model that we derive from it, offer an alternate narrative of how development change can be produced in agricultural systems, one which aligns with insights from complexity science and which, we argue, more closely represents the ways in which many research for development interventions work in practice. The nested ToC offers a starting point for asking a different set of evaluation and research questions which may be more relevant to participatory research efforts working from within a complexity-aware, agricultural innovation systems perspective.",

We present a RDT-based typology of co-management constellations showing that co-management is not a one-size-fits-all approach and summarize our findings in five propositions on the co-management of purchasing and marketing. In sum, we conceptualize co-management of marketing and purchasing as a bridging strategy that allows a focal firm to accommodate dependence on critical upstream and/or downstream resources and improves value creation within the supply chain.",

It subsequently applies the framework to a case study of SAP AG to illustrate how sourcing strategies changed over time in response to the logic of competition. The case study reveals that (a) organizations are adaptive systems and capable of organizational learning to make strategic changes pertaining to sourcing arrangements; (b) organizations select the terms in which they want to compete by developing certain capabilities within the firm; (c) organizations are reflexive and over time develop competitive hysteresis which allows them to become stronger competitors.

Disciplinary influences that contributed to shape the research are analysed and discussed. The findings suggest that social learning research is issue-driven and that some types of natural resources and geographical areas prevail over others. This study finds that deliberative democracy, pedagogy and research of complex adaptive systems have contributed the most to shaping the current conceptual base of the discourse. Interdisciplinary engagement, as well as choices in terms of what has been borrowed and how the borrowed concepts have been used, help to explain the heterogeneity of frameworks and definitions in the social learning literature.",

Studies on resilience in health systems are more recent, multiplying particularly since the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for national governments to increase the resilience of their health systems. Concepts help define research objects and guide the analysis. Yet, to be useful, concepts need to be clear and precise. We aimed to improve the conceptual understanding of health systems resilience by conducting a scoping review to describe the state of knowledge in this area. We searched for literature in 10 databases, and analyzed data using a list of themes. We evaluated the clarity and the precision of the concept of health systems resilience using Daigneault & Jacob's three dimensions of a concept: term, sense, and referent. Of the 1091 documents initially identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria. Term: multiple terms are used, switching from one to the other to speak about the same subject. Sense: there is no consensus yet on a unique definition. Referent: the magnitude and nature of events that resilient health systems face differ with context, covering a broad range of situations from sudden crisis to everyday challenges. The lack of clarity in this conceptualization hinders the expansion of knowledge, the creation of reliable analytical tools, and the effectiveness of communication. The current conceptualization of health systems resilience is too scattered to enable the enhancement of this concept with great potential, opening a large avenue for future research.",

abstract = "Background
The context for the study was a nation-wide programme in Australia to implement evidence-based practice in residential aged care, in nine areas of practice, using a wide range of implementation strategies and involving 108 facilities. The study drew on the experiences of those involved in the programme to answer the question: what mechanisms influence the implementation of evidence-based practice in residential aged care and how do those mechanisms interact?
Methods
The methodology used grounded theory from a critical realist perspective, informed by a conceptual framework that differentiates between the context, process and content of change. People were purposively sampled and invited to participate in semi-structured interviews, resulting in 44 interviews involving 51 people during 2009 and 2010. Participants had direct experience of implementation in 87 facilities, across nine areas of practice, in diverse locations. Sampling continued until data saturation was reached. The quality of the research was assessed using four criteria for judging trustworthiness: credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability.
Results
Data analysis resulted in the identification of four mechanisms that accounted for what took place and participants’ experiences. The core category that provided the greatest understanding of the data was the mechanism On Common Ground, comprising several constructs that formed a ‘common ground’ for change to occur. The mechanism Learning by Connecting recognised the ability to connect new knowledge with existing practice and knowledge, and make connections between actions and outcomes. Reconciling Competing Priorities was an ongoing mechanism whereby new practices had to compete with an existing set of constantly shifting priorities. Strategies for reconciling priorities ranged from structured approaches such as care planning to more informal arrangements such as conversations during daily work. The mechanism Exercising Agency bridged the gap between agency and action. It was the human dimension of change, both individually and collectively, that made things happen.
Conclusions
The findings are consistent with the findings of others, but fit together in a novel way and add to current knowledge about how to improve practices in residential aged care. Each of the four mechanisms is necessary but none are sufficient for implementation to occur.",

In such context, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a key role in digitizing manufacturing systems and integrating multiple systems together for collaborative works. Amongst different levels of smartness and connectedness of CPS, Digital Twin (DT), as an exact digital copy of a physical object or system including its properties and relationship with the environment, has a significant impact on realizing smart manufacturing. A DT constantly synchronizes with its physical system and provides real-time high-fidelity simulations of the system and offers ubiquitous control over the system. Despite its great advantages, few works have been discussed about DT reference models, let alone a generic manner to establish it for smart manufacturing. Aiming to fill the gap, this research introduces a generic CPS system architecture for DT establishment in smart manufacturing with a novel tri-model-based approach (i.e. digital model, computational model and graph-based model) for product-level DT development. The tri-model works concurrently to simulate real-world physical behaviour and characteristics of the digital model. To validate the proposed architecture and approach, a case study of an open source 3D printer DT establishment is further conducted. Conclusions and future works are also highlighted to provide insightful knowledge to both academia and industries at last.",

abstract = "The aim of this paper is to make a case generally for an ontology for accessibility requirements specification. Requirements specification is generally intended to provide clear, testable descriptions of what a system should do. What an ontology would do is to act like a requirements bank that provides methodology independent accessibility requirements that could then be used to extrapolate, on demand, conceptual models for a variety of implementations driven by a variety of methodologies. The effect of this would be to minimise requirements specification, ensure declarativity, standardisation, interoperability and reusability, whilst at the same time lending greater migratability from specification to design. There has been much worldwide action in developing guidelines, tools and methods in an attempt to ensure that technologies and information systems are accessible. There is, however, a growing need to partner these initiatives more closely with software engineering traditions. An ontology for accessibility requirements would provide formal semantic specifications beyond the syntactic provisions rendered by commonly used formal specification languages.",

abstract = "Four urban ecological design and planning research areas are identified: (1) application of ecosystem services, (2) adaptation of settlements for natural disasters, (3) ecological renewal of degraded urban places, and (4) ability of people to link knowledge to action to affect positive change. Ecosystem services are the benefits humans derive from nature, which, until relatively recently, were not normally valued by traditional economics or, when acknowledged, were regarded as externalities. Through the identification of economic and cultural benefits of ecosystems, higher standards for landscape performance can be established. As our climate continues to change, the number of natural disasters increases, frequently with catastrophic consequences for human settlements. Designers and planners must learn how to develop adaptive strategies to climate change and mitigation strategies for the consequences that result. Most cities include underused, degraded places that are ripe for creative redevelopment. Urban ecology provides a conceptual framework that recognizes the restorative potential of people. However, although knowledge about our environments abounds, we seem limited in our ability to adopt measures necessary to ensure a healthy planet for future generations. Each research area offers prospects for landscape and urban planning. Both planning perspectives are essential because the population continues to grow and people are increasingly living in urban and suburban places.",

Thus, modifications to a system that violate its architectural principles can degrade system performance and shorten its useful lifetime. As the potential frequency and scale of software adaptations increase to meet rapidly changing requirements and business conditions, controlling such architecture erosion becomes an important concern for software architects and developers. This paper presents a survey of techniques and technologies that have been proposed over the years either to prevent architecture erosion or to detect and restore architectures that have been eroded. These approaches, which include tools, techniques and processes, are primarily classified into three generic categories that attempt to minimise, prevent and repair architecture erosion. Within these broad categories, each approach is further broken down reflecting the high-level strategies adopted to tackle erosion. These are: process-oriented architecture conformance, architecture evolution management, architecture design enforcement, architecture to implementation linkage, self-adaptation and architecture restoration techniques consisting of recovery, discovery and reconciliation. Some of these strategies contain sub-categories under which survey results are presented. We discuss the merits and weaknesses of each strategy and argue that no single strategy can address the problem of erosion. Further, we explore the possibility of combining strategies and present a case for further work in developing a holistic framework for controlling architecture erosion.",

Fuzzy classes generalize discrete (fixed boundary) classes by assigning scores that relate each person to each class for representing within-class heterogeneity [13, 25]. Use of fuzzy classes permits individual heterogeneity to be represented by a relatively few analytically defined types [14]. Applying the properties of fuzzy set theory to user classification will result in the definition of a user's membership within a series of fuzzy user classes within the user space. These fuzzy classes can be considered an alternative method for defining stereotypes by empirically defining potential categories into which users can be assigned. The major difference between fuzzy user classes and stereotypes lies in the application of grades of membership to directly measure simultaneous membership in multiple categories. Thus, variability can be very accurately measured and represented using fuzzy sets and grades of membership. These fuzzy classes or user types represent archetypical users or fuzzy users. Application of fuzzy set theory provides an opportunity to extend the current classification methods to measure the differences between users more accurately. This increase in accuracy assists in developing effective adaptive human computer interfaces.",

Communication in the mining industry is the most critical factor to ensure the safety and security of the underground working environment. A robust IT communication infrastructure in underground mining will enhance safety and provide information in real-time which can result in a quick response to some fatal situation. Communication technologies that are capable of bearing the rough terrain and extreme environment inside a mine and between the surface and underground workstations is a critical factor for the monitoring of various underground mining operations remotely. Internet of Things (IoT) can play a massive role in the mining operations to improve the safety of the workers with enhanced productivity. Wireless communication, which is a part of IoT setup, is already playing a vital role in underground mine communication (UMC). Recently, IoT with its building blocks has been introduced to deploy and automate the operation of ‘self-advancing goaf edge support (SAGES)’ systems in an attempt to explore the possibility of the technology for real-time performance monitoring of support system including the behaviour of overlying roof strata in underground coal mines. The machine helps in supporting the roof of the mines during mining the coal. This paper presents a conceptual framework for implementation of IoT to make this underground support system smarter i.e. Smart-SAGES. The taxonomy of security challenges in UMC IoT combination has been described in detail in order to identify clear security goals. The blockchain based system seems to be a promising technology for the mining industry as it may help in curbing the penetration and disruption of cyber-attacks due to heterogeneous devices and distributed network. Various open issues in UMC have also been outlined. Vulnerabilities like information disclosure and Denial-of-Service attack (DoS attack) were discovered during the threat and risk analysis on the SAGES data logger. The SAGES falls into information generation block of IoT ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate the security by design approach from the initial phase of the development. Thus, the data transmission and storage can be made secure.",

We describe how we operationalise our strategy by first defining the different layers of interacting agents in a given MOOC system. We then tailor our approach to these different layers. Specifically, a two-pronged approach was developed, where we suggest that individual projects be assessed through performance monitoring; assessment criteria for which would be defined at the outset to include coverage, participation, quality and student achievement. In contrast, the success of an overall initiative should be considered within a more adaptive, emergent evaluation inquiry framework. We present the inquiry framework we developed for MOOC initiatives, and show how this framework might be used to develop evaluation questions and an assessment methodology. We also define the more fixed indicators and measures for project performance monitoring. Our strategy is described as it was developed to inform the evaluation of a MOOC initiative at the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa.",

In this paper, we explore energy saving opportunities of interface-based dynamic data structures. Our results suggest that savings opportunities exist in the C5 Collection between 16.95% and 97.50%. We propose a prototype and architecture for creating adaptive green data structures by applying machine learning tools to build a model for predicting energy efficient data structures based on the dynamic workload. Our neural network model can classify energy efficient data structures based on features such as the number of elements, frequency of operations, interface and set/bag semantics. The 10-fold cross validation result show 95.80% average accuracy of these predictions. Our n-gram model can accurately predict the most energy efficient data structure sequence in 19 simulated and real-world programs—on average, with more than 50% accuracy and up to 98% using a bigram predictor. Our GreenC5 prototype demonstrates how a green data structure can be implemented. With a simple decision making technique, the data structure can efficiently adapt for energy efficiency with low overhead. The actual medians of GreenC5′s potential energy savings from two test computers are 61.19% and 60.56% and range from 18% to 95%.",

The material consistency and the temporal continuity of built heritage in Mediterranean city make relevant its interpretation and analysis according to the resilient approach. The declination of this approach in many disciplines generated a substantial diversity among the definitions of resilience (Francis and Bekera, 2014). Consequently, frameworks, adopted for a quantitative or qualitative assessment, underline the lack of standardization and rigor in defining resilience measurements. A review of resilience literature and actual applications in urban context permit to understand that there are different operators working on the field: on the one hand there are international organizations, on the other hand there are academics. The review of both the two ambits of investigation intends to clarify specific properties and convergence points in order to trace an evolution of conceptual framework and to identify general features of urban resilience. This process is fundamental in focusing the main aims of the research program: the definition of the role of urban built heritage, given by the close correlation between masonry constructive technique, typologies and morphologies, its material value in urban system, and its relevance in Mediterranean city in constitution of urban resilience (UNISDR, 2012a). Despite an increasing number of academic studies concerning the role of built environment in defining and improving cities resilience, their major attention is still focused on street patterns and lifelines infrastructures. The paper concludes how the role of built heritage remains insufficiently explored and a correct definition of urban structure is still missing inside the domain of infrastructural resilience.",

abstract = "The vast and growing array of concepts, methods and tools in the sustainability field imply a need for a structuring and coordinating framework, including a unifying and operational definition of sustainability. One attempt at such framework began over 25 years ago and is now widely known as the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development. However, as with the larger sustainability field, the social dimension of this framework has been found to not be sufficiently science-based and operational and thus in need of further development. In this two-part series an attempt at a science-based, operational definition of social sustainability is presented. In this paper (part one), a systems-based approach to the social system is presented, as a basis for presenting a zero-hypothesis of principles for social sustainability in part two. Extensive literature studies as well as conceptual modelling sessions were performed and the social system was examined from various angles – complex adaptive system studies, human needs theory and other social sciences, and insights from these fields were woven together. The whole work was structured and guided by the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development. The focus of the study was on the essential aspects of the social system that need to be sustained (that cannot be systematically degraded) for it to be possible for people to meet their needs. These essential aspects were found to be trust, common meaning, diversity, capacity for learning and capacity for self-organization. Trust seems to be generally acknowledged to be the overriding aspect of a vital social system. A sense of common meaning is also stated by several authors as an important part of social capital and something that helps to keep a group or society together. Diversity is acknowledged as essential for resilience; in the human social system this can be interpreted as, e.g., diversity of personalities, ages, gender, skills. Capacity for learning and self-organization are also motivated from a resilience point of view by several authors. These results form a basis for the hypothesis for a definition of social sustainability presented in paper 2, which in turn is a step towards creating an enhanced support for strategic planning and innovation for sustainability.",

In floodplain-river ecosystems, there is growing interest from restoration practitioners in ecological resilience, yet regime shifts remain poorly understood in these ecosystems. To understand how regime shifts may apply to floodplain-river ecosystems, we synthesize our understanding of ecosystem dynamics using an alternate regimes conceptual framework. We present three plausible sets of alternate regimes relevant to natural resource management interests within the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River. These alternate regimes include: 1) a clear water and abundant vegetation regime vs. a turbid water and sparse vegetation regime in lentic, off-channel areas, 2) a diverse native fish community regime vs. an invasive-dominated fish community regime, and 3) a regime characterized by a diverse and dynamic mosaic of floodplain vegetation types vs. one characterized as a persistent invasive wet meadow monoculture. For each set of potential alternate regimes, we review available literature to synthesize known or hypothesized feedback mechanisms that reinforce regimes, controlling variables that drive regime transitions, and current restoration pathways. Our conceptual models provide preliminary support for the existence of alternate regimes in floodplain-river ecosystems. Quantitatively testing hypotheses contained within the conceptual model are important next steps in evaluating the model. Ultimately, the synthesis and evaluation of alternate regimes can inform the utility of resilience concepts in restoration and management on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River and improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in other large, heavily managed floodplain-river ecosystems.",

abstract = "The development and commercialization of contemporary medical devices are inherently multidisciplinary. Consequently, they have to undergo a stringent regulatory compliance procedure in conformity with an ever increasingly fierce and competitive business environment. Throughout the product life cycle, medical devices would significantly consume renewable as well as non-renewable resources and as a result exert a substantial social, economic and environmental impact(s). Sustainability from an overall perspective in terms of social, economic and environmental domains is crucial for decision-making during product development; nevertheless they have rarely been incorporated simultaneously. Both public and private institutions only focused towards economic and environmental sustainability without acknowledging the critical role of social sustainability that needs to be addressed concurrently so as to uphold the other two. Accordingly, it is imperative to consider the criteria of the aforementioned domains of sustainability in the initial phases of product development. The proposed conceptual multifaceted framework comprehensively explores a broader scope of sustainable product development, mainly from the pragmatic standpoint of systems engineering in comparison to the contemporary evaluation and development approaches. The underpinnings of the proposed framework encompass the critical role of a MultiCriteria Hierarchical Model (MCHM), which is in fact an extensive revision of the analytical hierarchy process decision making model. The MCHM mainly functions across the idea screening phase (Stage 2) up to the business and feasibility analysis phase (Stage 4). Moreover, unlike its predecessors, the MultiCriteria Hierarchical Model is less dependent upon numerical scores allotted by expert opinion and apparently broader in its scope of application. Furthermore, the proposed framework elucidates the active participation of the MCHM in product design and development by conjoining with an artificial intelligence based computer system known as expert systems. The principal objective of the proposed conceptual framework is to deliver a thorough assessment and a feasible roadmap for the development of sustainable medical devices.",

The development of solutions benefits from insights derived from modelling and simulating the complex interactions of the agri-food system, which range from global to household scales and transcend disciplinary boundaries. A wide range of models based on various methodologies (from food trade equilibrium to agent-based) seek to integrate direct and indirect drivers of change in land use, environment and socio-economic conditions at different scales. However, modelling such interaction poses fundamental challenges, especially for representing non-linear dynamics and adaptive behaviours. We identify key pieces of the fragmented landscape of food security modelling, and organize achievements and gaps into different contextual domains of food security (production, trade, and consumption) at different spatial scales. Building on in-depth reflection on three core issues of food security – volatility, technology, and transformation – we identify methodological challenges and promising strategies for advancement. We emphasize particular requirements related to the multifaceted and multiscale nature of food security. They include the explicit representation of transient dynamics to allow for path dependency and irreversible consequences, and of household heterogeneity to incorporate inequality issues. To illustrate ways forward we provide good practice examples using meta-modelling techniques, non-equilibrium approaches and behavioural-based modelling endeavours. We argue that further integration of different model types is required to better account for both multi-level agency and cross-scale feedbacks within the food system.",

Federal legislation passed in 2003 and 2004 mandates referrals of maltreated children under the age of 3years to Early Intervention (EI) services. This mandate has been variably implemented within and across states. Knowledge transfer is highlighted in this paper as a conceptual framework to understand mandated referral to EI services for young children with open child welfare cases. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with child welfare workers, EI providers, and public health department officials. These data were used to examine barriers to and facilitators of referral and service use for this population. Specifically, provider perspectives were solicited on how organizational culture, structures and standard operating procedures, and resources can support the mandated referral process. Findings highlight the importance of facilitating knowledge transfer within and between human service organizations, a process that requires an understanding of the various attributes of each participating system. This paper contributes to current knowledge by considering both intra- and inter-system barriers to knowledge transfer, extending examinations of mandated referral to consider downstream service provision, and informing future actions taken to address the developmental needs of young children in child welfare.",

abstract = "Unlike some critical minerals that are expected to have imminent shortages of supply such as indium, for a relatively high number of minerals, there is great uncertainty regarding their remaining years of supply. Boron mineral is one of these minerals with controversial reserve and years of supply estimates in the literature. Recent development and pursuit of new boron-consuming technologies and alternative products to existing boron-consuming products introduce additional uncertainty to sustainability of boron mineral. There is a need to explore how boron mineral can meet future demand given its diffusion and use in primary boron-consuming sectors, determine how diffusion may change its price and intensity of exploration activities along with key growth parameters GDP and population, and explore whether it may become a critical resource at the global level or not. For this purpose, a model was constructed to determine how diffusion of products containing boron can change at the global scale and how long boron reserves can be used to meet the respective demand by capturing dynamics of the system and partial treatment of complexity. It was determined that boron mineral may move from its current class of no criticality to high criticality when fast diffusion scenario is realized. In the slow diffusion scenario, boron mineral meets the demand for the next one hundered years and its annual consumption increases from 1,800 kilotons of borate in 2017 to 12,200 kilotons in 2117. The price of boron mineral gradually decreases to the one third of its current price of 1,620 dollars per ton of borate as the reserve of boron has an increasing trend up to the year 2078. In the fast diffusion scenario, boron mineral is can not meet the demand as the reserve is depleted in 2061 and the boron price rises to 17,400 dollars per ton of borate with a decreasing trend after this threshold point.",

abstract = "Context
Context-aware software systems can interact with different devices to complete their tasks and act according to the context, regardless of their development and organizational differences. Interoperability is a big challenge in the engineering of such systems.
Objective
To discuss how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems, strengthening the scientific basis for its understanding and conceptualization.
Method
A quasi-systematic literature review was undertaken to observe interoperability in such context-aware software systems to support the discussions. Its dataset includes 17 from 408 papers identified in the technical literature. The extracted information was qualitatively analyzed by following the principles of Grounded Theory.
Results
The analysis allowed to identify ten interoperability concepts, organized into a Theoretical Framework according to structural and behavioral perspectives, which deals with interoperability as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage interaction with a system) to interact for a particular purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome. Once the interoperability is established from structural concepts (context, perspective, purpose, the level of provided support and system attributes), it can be measured, improved and observed from the behavioral concepts (evaluation method, challenges, issues, and benefits).
Conclusions
The Interoperability Theoretical Framework provides relevant information to organize the knowledge related to interoperability, considering context, and can be used to guide the evolution of software systems regarding changes focused on interoperability.",

abstract = "The Business practices of an industrialized civilization are responsible for intensifying the dynamics of the interdependent environmental, social and economic domains of our ecosystem. The worldwide objective to accomplish Sustainability is invariably addressed by Policy makers and Institutions by means of moderately disparate co-relations between Environmental and Social considerations. The dimension of Social Sustainability has a direct co-relation towards the extended continuation of a globalized Enterprise. The stated co-relation is an interconnected and interdependent network comprising of growth in Innovation and Sustainability at the Environmental and Economic frontiers. From the standpoint of Innovation, the 20th century has been dominated by both TRIZ with OTSM and Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns to steer the future of revolutionary innovations. Moreover, TRIZ and its evolved counterpart OTSM have been extensively utilized for macro-scale problem solving scenarios, while Kurzweil's Law has reached up to quantum scale whereby matter as we know exhibits an entire range of unique properties with a potential to dramatically transform our human civilization. Accordingly, the perceived limitations and vague applicability of TRIZ in sub-macro scale innovations has been discussed. The contemporary tools for project evaluation (e.g.: cost benefit analysis) and product development (e.g.: linear stage-gate process) quintessential for commercializing innovations are identified to be limited, both in scope and accuracy for delivering a long term ‘sustainable’ competitive advantage to an Enterprise. Consequently, the proposed conceptual Multifaceted Framework addresses the issue of social sustainability in Product Development. The underpinnings of Systems Thinking, TRIZ and OTSM, Complex Adaptive Systems, Socio-Economics & Human Behavior forms the fundamental basis of the proposed Multifaceted Framework. The novel perspective offered by the proposed Framework enables product development teams to overcome the inherent myopia and other limitations associated with the contemporary Environmental Life Cycle Analysis and Sustainability related Decision Models. An Expert opinion based evaluation technique in conjugation with a Multilayered Decision Modeling Method have been incorporated as a salient features in the proposed framework. The evaluation technique is utilized for assigning numerical values to the pertinent sustainability related criteria of the Multilayered Decision Model. The proposed Framework plays a crucial role in product development and decision modeling across the Idea Screening Phase (Stage 2) up to the Feasibility Analysis Phase (Stage 4). In addition, a modified version Taguchi Loss Function is included to exemplify a tangible relation between Product Quality parameters and Sustainability. The objective of the proposed framework is to provide an efficient, yet comprehensive evaluation as well as an effective product development strategy with a distinct and a holistic outlook on Social Sustainability.",

Time after time researches have provided us with models for the development of computer-based learning/teaching systems. One approach currently seems to be attractive to many researchers; that based upon the concept of an adaptive system for teaching. In this paper we will examine this concept and conduct a critical review of some of the models currently being followed in the development of such learning environments. We will also study the concept of an Operational Learning System which can provide the elements necessary for the development of an appropriate framework for truly adaptive teaching.",

abstract = "Our group has proposed that in contrast to chronic stress that can have harmful effects, the short-term (fight-or-flight) stress response (lasting for minutes to hours) is nature’s fundamental survival mechanism that enhances protection and performance under conditions involving threat/challenge/opportunity. Short-term stress enhances innate/primary, adaptive/secondary, vaccine-induced, and anti-tumor immune responses, and post-surgical recovery. Mechanisms and mediators include stress hormones, dendritic cell, neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte trafficking/function and local/systemic chemokine and cytokine production. Short-term stress may also enhance mental/cognitive and physical performance through effects on brain, musculo-skeletal, and cardiovascular function, reappraisal of threat/anxiety, and training-induced stress-optimization. Therefore, short-term stress psychology/physiology could be harnessed to enhance immuno-protection, as well as mental and physical performance. This review aims to provide a conceptual framework and targets for further investigation of mechanisms and conditions under which the protective/adaptive aspects of short-term stress/exercise can be optimized/harnessed, and for developing pharmacological/biobehavioral interventions to enhance health/healing, and mental/cognitive/physical performance.",

Mindful organising is both the unique source of critical information about the normal operation, as well as the key recipient of intelligence about the operation, ensuring that operational actions are always informed by the most current, relevant information about potential risks no matter how remote. However, the mindful organising construct has never been operationalised as a practical and effective approach for complex ultra-safe systems. Within the Future Sky Safety programme the construct has been reworked to reinforce the idea that mindful organising is more than just a state of mind. It is about the gathering and flow of information to ensure awareness and appropriate action, both at the operational level and amongst middle management in ensuring improvements are effectively implemented. A novel model has been advanced which provides an organisational context for its implementation, based on the behavioural-economic principle that being well informed about an issue, having an effective and practical solution and being accountable, creates a compelling obligation to act in an appropriate manner. It is suggested how the operationalisation of this model could be supported through a set of generic prototype software applications. The potential applicability of this approach covers not only all sectors of aviation, but also all industries that carry a significant operational risk, including other transport modes, health and social care, emergency services and financial services.",

These instruments affect regulated and unregulated firms in the ICT ecosystem in multifaceted ways and sometimes have counterintuitive effects on aggregate performance. The design of policies is further complicated by trade-offs between short-term and long-term policy objectives. This article examines individual and joint effects of regulatory and other policy instruments on the investment incentives in advanced communications. It conceptualizes governance as a problem of “tuning” a highly dynamic, adaptive system. Alternative consistent combinations of regulation and public policy are feasible but they have different implications for sector outcomes, most importantly the balance between static and dynamic performance.",

abstract = "The dominant processes in gravel beach dynamics are reviewed, highlighting some common themes which unify the various components of the gravel beach system, the repercussions of which impart on how gravel beach dynamics might be understood conceptually. In particular, gravel beach dynamics are thought to be highly dependent on the temporal and spatial variation in grain size, and the continual adjustments made by an active beach step, both of which act not only as the expression of changing morphodynamic conditions, but also as a controlling influence. Morphodynamics, the notion that the exchanges on beaches between the hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphological change takes the form of reciprocal relationships which are mediated through feedback mechanisms (in such a way that they cannot be thought of or studied independently) is not a new one. Yet it appears that for the gravel beach, morphodynamics must be re-defined to describe conditions where variations in sediment size are thought to deserve parity, rather than as merely a sequent entity or boundary condition. ‘Morpho-sedimentary-dynamics’ is a phrase coined to intuit such cause and effect, detailing the co-evolution of morphology, hydro-hydraulics and sediment properties whilst acknowledging causative pluralism, feedbacks and multiplier effects. This is the recommended conceptual framework within which to crystallise thought and organise further research for the gravel beach. Essentially, it increases the minimum number of parameters needed to describe the state of the gravel beach as a physical system. Therefore, it is advised that simplicity will be most expedient in our future modelling efforts, if complexity is to be adequately encapsulated.",

Despite the growing interest, this field of research suffers from several limitations: it draws mostly on services marketing theory, and it is grounded mostly in monadic and dyadic studies. This paper contributes to the advance of business services research by addressing these limitations with regard to a specific service-related issue. We carry out an interdisciplinary study by integrating among others an industrial network approach (INA) into the services area, and we thus develop the research at a network level by adopting a services network perspective; furthermore, the study is carried out in a business-to-business context by looking into a health cluster: the Health Cluster Portugal. The article addresses one particular aspect of business services networks: their emergence. We propose a conceptual framework that draws on process-based research and integrates theories from other bodies of research, allowing a rich understanding of how a business service network is created. Our findings point to discontinuities along the emergence of such networks, showing that there is an iterative process underlying their formation, with different theories playing a predominant explanatory role at different stages. This paper contributes to the wider body of literature on services research by promoting the integration of the INA and other process-related approaches in the area of business services networks, and also provides practitioners and policy-makers with a structured framework to understand how an intentional ‘bottom–up’ business service network may be created or orchestrated.",

abstract = "The Ramsar Convention is unquestionably the backbone of modern wetland management theory and practice. In the last four decades, it has mainstreamed wetlands in the environmental discourse and fostered the development of a comprehensive institutional framework for wetland governance. However, many of the wetlands that occur in human-dominated landscapes remain acutely threatened. The problem is most alarming in urban areas, especially in the fast expanding cities of the developing world, where unprecedented wetland destruction is leading to recurring environmental disasters. This triggers the question: are these failures in wetland governance purely induced by factors exogenous to Ramsar-based institutions or are they manifestations of conceptual drawbacks within Ramsar conceptual framework. Here, we investigate the success and failures of the application of the Ramsar framework's policy directives and management guidelines for urban wetlands using two rapidly expanding cities in South Asia as case studies – Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Kolkata (India). We conclude that despite its remarkable achievements over the past four decades, the Ramsar framework has several conceptual drawbacks that weaken its effectiveness in complex urban contexts. An inadequate recognition of the complex dynamics of urban social-ecological systems, an inadequate recognition of the political complexity of the policy processes, and a lack of an environmental justice perspective are the main shortcomings contributing to failures in urban wetlands governance. While we acknowledge that some solutions are contingent upon national and transnational level socio-political processes and reforms, we offer a set of technical and strategic modifications to the Ramsar framework that can significantly improve its effectiveness in urban wetlands governance.",

Assessing SES vulnerability to abrupt ecosystem state changes remains challenging, however, because frameworks do not operationally link ecological, socio-economic and cultural elements of the SES. We conducted a targeted literature review on empirical assessments of SES and TPs in the marine realm and their use in ecosystem-based management. Our results revealed a plurality of terminologies, definitions and concepts that hampers practical operationalisation of these concepts. Furthermore, we found a striking lack of socio-cultural aspects in SES vulnerability assessments, possibly because of a lack of involvement of stakeholders and interest groups. We propose guiding principles for assessing vulnerability to TPs that build on participative approaches and prioritise the connectivity between SES components by accounting for component linkages, cascading effects and feedback processes.",

Biofuel policies play an important role in ethanol production, consumption, and investment in processing capacity. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of how current policies affect the evolution of the market is lacking. We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model to analyze the impact of different blend mandates and taxes levied on gasoline, hydrous, and anhydrous ethanol on investment in processing capacity and on production and consumption of ethanol. The model uses land use projections by the PCRaster Land Use Change model and incorporates the institutions governing the actors’ strategic decision making with regard to production and consumption of ethanol, and the institutions governing the interaction among actors. From the investigated mix of policy measures, we find that an increase of the gasoline tax leads to the highest increased investments in sugarcane processing capacity. We also find that a gasoline tax above 1.23 R$/l and a tax exemption for hydrous ethanol may lead to doubling the production of ethanol by 2030 (relative to 2016).",

Cases studies of two firms, Batterymarch Financial Management and Mrs. Fields' Cookies, are then presented. Both firms experienced explosive growth, and, through innovative use of information technology, enjoyed substantial productivity advantages over their competitors. Both firms, however, entered unexpected periods of decline in the mid- to late-1980s, from which they never emerged. The declines are explained as failures of organizational learning, precipitated by information systems that inadvertently sacrificed important environmental scanning activities in order to achieve efficient self-regulation.",

The paper discusses themes of PSM research and proposes three avenues of future PSM research for industrial marketing scholars: 1) theorizing on the concept of supply networks, 2) revisiting the notion of managing supply networks and 3) debating established “best practices” in PSM. The proposal is therefore to dedicate more research to develop further theory on supply networks and how to manage within supply networks, because there is a surprising lack of conceptual clarity as to the meaning of supply networks and the notion of managing supply networks. The paper argues that as increasing supply network complexity and risks, especially concerning sustainability, requires new thinking about how best to influence and manage supply networks.",

The methodology that was followed favours the detailed description of the objectives of the system, with individual elements and adaptation to the surrounding environment, amongst other features. The proposed model integrates a knowledge database that supports the process of identification of cooperative strategies such as material exchange networks in industrial areas. The underlying theory for the assessment of cooperative interactions is game theory, which supports the resolution of problems with strategic choices.

Considering the management requirements of a flood monitoring system, we propose a sensor web heterogeneous node meta-model and discuss the development of five basic metadata components, the design of a nine-tuple node information description structure. A prototype system GeosensorNodeManager is implemented to provide the functions of modeling, querying, and visualizing node resources. For the application scenario of flood monitoring, the flood forecasting task is selected as an example to test the versatility of the proposed node meta-model and the applicability of the formal expression based on the nine-tuple metadata framework. Results show that the proposed meta-model can be used in the modeling of three different types of sensor web nodes with the extension mechanism. By querying and visualizing the sensor web node instances in the Yangtze River basin, the node meta-model provides an effective way for the resource management of a flood monitoring sensor web system. Compared with the typical flood monitoring platform “Sentinel Asia,” the proposed meta-model can offer a succinct description of the system and lay the component model foundation for architecture design.",

Forest managers are tasked with maintaining and/or promoting species diversity and resilience; however, the success of these efforts depends on a robust understanding of past and future system dynamics and identification and application of appropriate silvicultural interventions. We review how historical timber harvesting and land use, increases in deer population sizes, invasive species, and contemporary forest management practices interact to erode ecological memory and increase resilience debt of hardwood forests of eastern North America. The erosion of ecological memory and growing resilience debt in these forests pose significant challenges for forest managers because they alter the response of forests to management from the understory to overstory. Differences in how much ecological memory these systems retain, as well as the mosaic of interacting factors influencing contemporary dynamics, preclude a one size fits all management approach. That being said, our review has identified a host of common factors and pathways that can be manipulated. The approach we propose requires a more thoughtful understanding of the forest understory as the foundation upon which resilient systems are built. Which silvicultural levers will have the greatest utility clearly depend on the ecological context of the forest, and a willingness to experiment and adapt. We offer a conceptual model and recommendations for managers confronting novel plant communities and uncertain system dynamics.",

Organic farming is a potential way to reduce environmental impacts by excluding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers from the process. Despite ecological benefits, it is unlikely that conversion to organic can be financially viable for farmers, without additional support and incentives from consumers. This study models the interplay between consumer preferences and socio-environmental issues related to agriculture and food production. We operationalize the novel concept of extended agro-food supply chain and simulate adaptive behavior of farmers, food processors, retailers, and customers. Not only the operational factors (e.g., price, quantity, and lead time), but also the behavioral factors (e.g., attitude, perceived control, social norms, habits, and personal goals) of the food suppliers and consumers are considered in order to foster organic farming. We propose an integrated approach combining agent-based, discrete-event, and system dynamics modeling for a case of wine supply chain. Findings demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model over the traditional sustainable supply chain models in incorporating the feedback between consumers and producers and analyzing management scenarios that can urge farmers to expand organic agriculture. Results further indicate that demand-side participation in transition pathways towards sustainable agriculture can become a time-consuming effort if not accompanied by the middle actors between consumers and farmers. In practice, our proposed model may serve as a decision-support tool to guide evidence-based policymaking in the food and agriculture sector.",

abstract = "The quality and amount of the world food supply is crucial to the well-being of every human on the planet in the basic sense that we need food to live. It also has a profound impact on world economy, international trade, and global political stability. The choice of land used for agriculture, and the livestock and plants raised on the land, will impact the sustainable use of global resources. On a global scale, there are communities where insufficient food causes nutritional deficiencies, and at the same time, there are other communities eating too much food leading to obesity. Both conditions have accompanying diseases with associated financial consequences. The above issues relate to various scales, from local to global, and to a range of scientific disciplines. Moreover, their various elements are part of an interdependent, continuously changing, and adaptive system. This implies that the response of a combination of individual elements cannot usually be inferred from the response of each individual element or subsystem. This makes the identification of an appropriate intervention to change one or more elements a complex problem. We propose that a complex system approach should be used to address the global challenges of the agriculture and food system. The complex system approach accounts for the needs of stakeholders and policymakers in the agriculture and food system, and helps to determine which research programs will enable stakeholders to better anticipate and respond to emerging developments in the world. Moreover, the approach will enable them to determine effective intervention strategies to simultaneously optimise and safeguard their interests and the interests of the environment. The approach is formulated in terms of a roadmap of procedures. It encompasses an array of methods utilised in an integrative multi-scale and inter-disciplinary way.",

In some cases of cyberphysical networks, their configuration can be done in a centralized way (e.g., automated production line configuration). However, for socio-cyberphysical networks the centralized control is not possible due to the independence and autonomy of the network members (e.g., employees of an enterprise). The paper proposes an approach to model such network via a set of interacting socio-inspired services. Such services are capable to model behavior of the network participants taking into account their preferences, strategies and social norms. The interoperability of the services is achieved due to the usage of common standards (such as WSDL and SOAP) at the technological level, and common ontology at the semantic level. The developed conceptual model of socio-inspired service is presented together with behavior patterns and methods for their processing.",

Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback.",

This article analyzes the general problem of how the dynamical coupling between internal control (brain), body and environment is used in the generation of specific behaviors. Based on the Evolutionary Robotics (ER) paradigm, four computational models are described to support discussions including descriptions on performance after a series of structural, sensorimotor or mutational perturbations, or are developed in the absence of them. Experimental results suggest that ‘dynamic determinacy’ – i.e. the continuous presence of a unique dynamical attractor that must be chased during functional behaviors – is a common dynamic phenomenon in the analyzed robust and adaptive agents. These agents show dynamical states that are definitely and unequivocally characterized via transient dynamics toward a unique, yet moving attractor at neural level for coherent actions. This determinacy emerges as a control strategy rooted on behavioral couplings and relies on mechanisms that are distributed on brain, body and environment. Different ways to induce further distribution of behavioral mechanisms are also discussed in this paper from a bio-inspired ER perspective.",

abstract = "Introduction: Throughout the 1990s, in response to funding deficits, out-of-pocket payment has grown as a share of total expenditure in countries in transition. A clear policy response to informal payments is, however, lacking. The current study explores informal payments in Bulgaria within a conceptual framework developed by triangulating information using a variety of methodologies. Objective: To estimate the scale and determinants of informal payments in the health sector of Bulgaria and to identify who benefits, the characteristics and timing of payments, and the reasons for paying. Design: Data were derived from a national representative survey of 1547 individuals complemented by in-depth interviews and focus groups with over 100 respondents, conducted in Bulgaria in 1997. Informal payments are defined as a monetary or in-kind transaction between a patient and a staff member for services that are officially free of charge in the state sector. Results: Informal payments are relatively common in Bulgaria, especially if in the form of gifts. Informal cash payments are universal for operations and childbirth, clear-cut and life-threatening procedures, in hospitals or elite urban facilities or well-known physicians. Most gifts were given at the end of treatment and most cash payments-before or during treatment. Wealthier, better educated, younger respondents tend to pay more often, as a means of obtaining better-quality treatment in a de facto two-tier system. Since the transition, informal payments had become frequent, explicit, solicited by staff, increasingly in cash, and less affordable. Informal payments stem from the low income of staff, patients seeking better treatment; acute funding shortages; and from tradition. Attitudes to informal payments range from strongly negative (if solicited) to tolerant (if patient-initiated), depending on the circumstances. Conclusions: The study provides important new insights into the incidence and nature of informal payments in the health sector in Bulgaria. Payments were less than expected, very complex, organised in a chaotic, although adaptive, system, and relatively equitable. The timing of payment and the presence of compulsion is a key factor in distinguishing between informal payments given in gratitude or as a bribe, and the latter are seen as problematic, needing to be addressed. Paying informally appeared to be a product of socio-economic reality rather than culture and tradition. The study showed that the principle of comprehensive free coverage existing in Bulgaria until 1989 has been significantly eroded. Initiating a public debate on informal payments is important in a health care reform process that purports to increase accountability.",

These two objectives are in conflict and constitute an open problem. A new operational framework to form the evolving information granule (EIG) is developed in this paper, which ensures a compromise between interpretability and reasonable accuracy. The evolving information granule is initiated with the first information granule by translating the knowledge of the entire output domain. The initial information granule is considered an underfitting state with a high approximation error. Then, the EIG starts evolving in the information granule by partitioning the output domain and uses a dynamic constraint to maintain semantic interpretability in the output-contexts. The important criterion in the EIG is to determine the prominent distinction (output-context) in the output domain and realize the distinct information granule that depicts the semantics at the fuzzy partition level. The EIG tends to evolve toward the lower error region and realizes the effective rulebase by avoiding overfitting. The outcome on the synthetic and real-world data using the EIG shows the effectiveness of the proposed system, which outperforms state-of-the art methods.",

abstract = "Environmental security, as the opposite of environmental vulnerability (fragility), is multi-layered, multi-scale and complex, existing in both the objective physical, biological, and social realm, and the subjective realm of individual human perception. In this paper, we detect and quantify the scales and spatial patterns of human land use as ecosystem disturbances at different hierarchical levels in a panarchy of social–ecological landscapes (SELs) by using a conceptual framework that characterizes multi-scale disturbance patterns exhibited on satellite imagery over a four-year time period in Apulia (South Italy). In this paper we advance the measure of the functional importance of ESPs provided by natural areas and permanent cultivations based on their effectiveness at performing the services. Any landscape element contributes to the overall proportion of disturbance in the region, through its composition of disturbed locations (pixels), and to the overall disturbance connectivity through its configuration. Such landscape elements represent, in turn, functional units for assessing functional contributions of ES providers at different scale(s) of operation of the service. We assume that such effectiveness at performing the services will result directly affected by how much disturbance surrounds ESP locations at different neighborhoods. Multi-scale measurements of the composition and spatial configuration of disturbance are the basis for evaluating vulnerability of ecosystem services through multi-scale disturbance profiles concerning land-use locations where most of ecosystem service providers reside. Vulnerability estimates are derived from the identification of scale range couplings or mismatches among land-use disturbances related to different land uses and revealed by trajectories from the global profile to local spatial patterns. Scale mismatches of disturbances in space and time determine the role of land use as a disturbance source or sink, and may govern the triggering of landscape changes affecting ecosystem service providers at the scale(s) of operation of the service. The role of natural areas and permanent cultivations (olive groves and vineyards) in providing disturbance regulation across scales in South Italy has consequences for regional SELs since it may govern if and how disturbances associated with land-use intensification (sources) will affect the functional contribution of ES providers.",

abstract = "Context
Current software systems have increasingly implemented context-aware adaptations to handle the diversity of conditions of their surrounding environment. Therefore, people are becoming used to a variety of context-aware software systems (CASS). This context-awareness brings challenges to the software construction and testing because the context is unpredictable and may change at any time. Therefore, software engineers need to consider the dynamic context changes while testing CASS. Different test case design techniques (TCDT) have been proposed to support the testing of CASS. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no analysis of these proposals on the advantages, limitations and their effective support to context variation during testing.
Objective
To gather empirical evidence on TCDT concerned with CASS by identifying, evaluating and synthesizing knowledge available in the literature.
Method
To undertake a secondary study (quasi-Systematic Literature Review) on TCDT for CASS regarding their assessed quality characteristics, used coverage criteria, test type, and test technique.
Results
From 833 primary studies published between 2004 and 2014, just 17 studies regard the design of test cases for CASS. Most of them focus on functional suitability. Furthermore, some of them take into account the changes in the context by providing specific test cases for each context configuration (static perspective) during the test execution. These 17 studies revealed five challenges affecting the design of test cases and 20 challenges regarding the testing of CASS. Besides, seven TCDT are not empirically evaluated.
Conclusion

However, it has not been observed evidence on any TCDT supporting the truly context-aware testing, which that can adapt the expected output based on the context variation (dynamic perspective) during the test execution. It is an open issue deserving greater attention from researchers to increase the testing coverage and ensure users confidence in CASS.",

abstract = "Why should a parcel of agricultural land be abandoned when there is a scarcity of food? In this paper, we address this question in relation to the hills of Nepal, where agricultural land is being abandoned at an unprecedented rate, despite looming food scarcity. Responding to studies that have highlighted land abandonment trends, we conducted in-depth case studies in two of Nepal's hill districts to understand how land abandonment is taking place, and under what circumstances. Using an interdisciplinary lens and transcending linear models of agrarian change which attribute land abandonment to one or more prominent factors, our study unravels complex, cross-scalar processes, involving the interaction among social forces and environmental factors which lead to land underutilisation. The paper shows that land underutilisation happens through what we term ‘socio-environmental pathways’, which operate across scales, yet are deeply rooted in local dynamics of agrarian change. These pathways are triggered by, and embroiled within, three wider socio-economic and political dynamics in contemporary Nepal, namely: socio-cultural changes that favour out-migration; evolving economic opportunities that make farming less profitable; and a policy context in which the gravity of the land abandonment challenge goes unrecognised. The framework of ‘socio-environmental pathways’ applied here also advances a theoretical lens to explain agrarian change in a way that integrates multiple scales and multiple sectors, emphasising a thoroughly empirical approach. Finally, we identify key policy implications of this research on livelihoods and sustainable development.",

There are many watershed pollution load models; however, their effectivity is generally poor in semiarid and semihumid areas because of the complexity of hydrological processes and pollutant transport processes. In this paper, a pollution load module was combined with the well-established HIMS (Hydro-Informatic Modelling System) model for the purpose of simulating the processes of pollution generation and transport and quantifying the pollution load in semiarid and semihumid areas. The model has the advantages of a simple structure and low data requirement, and can simulate dissolved and solid-phase nitrogen and phosphorus. As a demonstration, the HIMS-pollution load (HIMS-PL) model was respectively tested for three semiarid and semihumid basins in China—the Liuhe and the Yixunhe River basins, two sub-basins of the Luanhe River basin, and the Chaohe River basin. Model simulations of streamflow and pollution loads at monthly time step accurately matched the observed streamflow (with NSEs 0.77–0.95 and REs 0.53–11.24%) and pollution load (with NSEs 0.54–0.83 and REs 2.45–12.72% for total nitrogen loads and with NSEs 0.51–0.79 and REs 2.22–19.70% for total phosphorus loads). In comparison with HSPF and GWLF models, the HIMS-PL model performed better than the GWLF model in all of the above-mentioned basins and better than the HSPF model in some of the basins. Overall, the proposed model is generally suitable for simulating streamflow and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions.",

Using an indigenous theoretical lens, this article presents a review of existing theoretical frameworks applied to environmental changes and empirical studies with indigenous populations.
Methods
The conceptual model joins elements from the indigenist stress-coping model from the field of social work with the exposure pathway model from the field of public health.
Results
The interdisciplinary model joins elements from the indigenist stress-coping model with the exposure pathway model to highlight indigenous-specific sensitivities and cultural buffers that are particular to the impacts of environmental change among indigenous peoples.

Within this framework, the centrality of the inertial matrix emerges. The physical significance of the inertial coefficients is further illuminated by the introduction of the coefficient of coupling of robotic manipulators. The properties of the inertial matrix follow directly from the kinematic and dynamic parameters of the robot. These properties translate into the characteristics of the centrifugal, Coriolis and gravitational components of the dynamic robot model. The novel approach reinforces the need to integrate the mechanical and controller designs of robotic manipulators. The conceptual framework leads to design guidelines for simplifying and reducing the nonlinear kinematic and dynamic coupling of robot dynamics.

The basic intuition of our approach is to extract sets of possible behaviour runs from the agents’ behaviour models and to verify whether these runs conform to the specifications of the system-to-be or not. This approach is applicable at design time, not requiring source code, thus enabling detection and removal of some defects at an early phase of the software development lifecycle. We followed an experimental approach for evaluating the proposed verification framework. Our evaluation shows that even simple system’s specifications developed by relatively experienced developers are prone to defects, and our approach is successful in uncovering most of these defects. In addition, we conducted a scalability analysis on the approach, and the outcomes show that our approach can scale when designs grow in size.",

Recently, several frameworks and models have been proposed to support the design and development of multimodal interfaces. However, it is challenging to provide automatic modality adaptation in multimodal interfaces. Existing approaches are using rule-based specifications to define the adaptation of input/output modalities. Rule-based specifications have the problems of completeness and coherence. Distinct from previous work, this paper presents a novel approach that quantifies the user preference of each modality and considers the adaptation as an optimization issue that searches for a set of input/output modalities matching user's preference. Our approach applies a cross-layer design, which considers the adaptation from the perspectives of the interaction context, available system resources, and QoS requirements. Furthermore, our approach supports human-centric adaptation. A user can report the preference of a modality so that selected modalities fit user's personal needs. An optimal solution and a heuristic algorithm have been developed to automatically select an appropriate set of modality combinations under a specific situation. We have designed a framework based on the heuristic algorithm and existing ontology, and applied the framework to conduct a utility evaluation, in which we have employed a within-subject experiment. Fifty participants were invited to go through three scenarios and compare automatically selected modalities with randomly selected modalities. The results from the experiment show that users perceived the automatically selected modalities as appropriate and satisfactory.",

The aim of this paper is to propose a systems interpretation of the concept of complexity and its implications for a theoretical discussion of the concept of boundary in complex service systems. The proposal highlights the interpretative contribution of a dual perspective of observation that distinguishes between a structure-based view and a systems-based view. When dealing with complexity, the phenomenon under investigation cannot be addressed through management approaches that aim to measure and control it in a vain attempt to find the best solution. Due to the inner nature of complexity, a more rewarding approach to a full understanding of problematic situations should place consolidated management models within a more general interpretation framework that suggests preliminary insights about the real nature of the investigated phenomenon. First, this paper outlines the theoretical background of the literature on service, service systems and complex service systems, providing evidence of the contribution of recent service research advances such as service science and service-dominant logic. Next, the paper focuses on the basic principles of systems thinking to introduce the Viable Systems Approach (vSa) as a general framework of reference for both the investigation and the governance of social organisations. The vSa conceptual framework is adopted for proposing some reflections from a systems perspective in the investigation of the case of the London Borough of Sutton (LBS). The focus is on interpreting the paradoxical situation of an increased fear of crime among LBS residents despite the evidence of reduction in the crime rate. Although the incidence has fallen for most types of crimes, a recent poll confirmed that crime is still rated as the most important issue for residents. Therefore, improving safety and reducing crime remain the top priorities for the Safer Sutton Partnership Service. In short, this study proposes to consider “reducing the fear of crime in a community” as a complex service system.",

The biological immune system potentially offers interesting features to face the threats (bacteria, viruses, cancers, etc.) that may harm an organism.

Based on analogies that we point out, we suggest a framework to help with the design of software tools that are more able to assist decision makers in dealing with various types of disruptions occurring in a manufacturing system.

Despite a recent emphasis of research on agent-based modelling and on energy transitions, an overview of how the methodology may be of value to understanding transition processes is still missing from the literature. This systematic review evaluates the potential of agent-based modelling to understanding energy transitions from a social-scientific perspective, based on a set of 62 articles. Six topic areas were identified, addressing different components of the energy system: Electricity Market, Consumption Dynamics/ Consumer Behaviour, Policy and Planning, New Technologies/ Innovation, Energy System, Transitions. Distribution of articles across topic areas was indicative of a continuing interest in electricity market related enquiries, and an increasing number of studies in the realm of policy and planning. Based on the relevance of energy transition specific complexities to the choice of ABM as a methodology, four complexity categories (1–4) were identified. Indicating the degree of association between the complexity of energy transitions and ABM’s ability to address these, the categorisation revealed that 35 of the 62 studies directly linked the choice of ABM to energy transition complexities (complexity category 1) or were set in the context of energy transitions (complexity category 2). The review further showed that the greatest potential contribution of ABM to energy transition studies lies in its practical application to decision-making in policy and planning. More interdisciplinary collaboration in model development is recommended to address the discrepancy between the relevance of social factors to modelling energy transitions and the ability of the social sciences to make effective use of ABM.",

abstract = "[Context] Complex and heterogeneous software systems need to be monitored as their full behavior often only emerges at runtime, e.g., when interacting with other systems or the environment. Software monitoring approaches observe and check properties or quality attributes of software systems during operation. Such approaches have been developed in diverse communities for various kinds of systems and purposes. For instance, requirements monitoring aims to check at runtime whether a software system adheres to its requirements, while resource or performance monitoring collects information about the consumption of computing resources by the monitored system. Many venues publish research on software monitoring, often using diverse terminology, and focusing on different monitoring aspects and phases. The lack of a comprehensive overview of existing research often leads to re-inventing the wheel. [Objective] We provide a domain model to structure and systematize the field of software monitoring, starting with requirements and resource monitoring. [Method] We developed an initial domain model based on (i) our extensive experiences with requirements and resource monitoring, (ii) earlier efforts to develop a comparison framework for monitoring approaches, and (iii) an earlier systematic literature review on requirements monitoring frameworks. We then systematically analyzed 47 existing requirements and resource monitoring approaches to iteratively refine the domain model and to develop a reference architecture for software monitoring approaches. [Results] Our domain model covers the key elements of monitoring approaches and allows analyzing their commonalities and differences. Together with the reference architecture, our domain model supports the development of integrated monitoring solutions. We provide details on 47 approaches we analyzed with the model to assess its coverage. We also evaluate the reference architecture by instantiating it for five different monitoring solutions. [Conclusions] We conclude that requirements and resource monitoring have more commonalities than differences, which is promising for the future integration of existing monitoring solutions.",

Comparison of the model tests lends support to a composite, serial multipath specification where both team effectiveness and the CE methods for increasing development process simultaneity contribute directly to project performance and mediate the contributions of other CE tools. Team effectiveness was higher for teams using CE tools and methods which standardize engineering methodologies. The use of simultaneity methods was higher for project teams using some other CE tools. CE Tools for data integration and for increased customer input made no contribution to project task performance. The model specifying an interactive synergy between the tools and methods of CE was the least successful. Most of the benefits from the tools and methods of CE can be achieved by focusing implementation effort on increasing simultaneity in the development process and improving team decision-making effectiveness.",

Advances have been made in theoretical, methodological, thematic and applied aspects of biogeomorphology. A review of key publications and symposia over the period illustrates growth in biogeomorphology with particular advances in quantitative understandings of biogeomorphic interactions, in interdisciplinary participation, and in theoretical framings. Theoretical advances have been influenced by the desire to answer four fundamental questions: How do ecological and geomorphological systems interact? Is there a geomorphological signature of life? How important is biodiversity to landscape evolution and vice versa? How have life and landscape co-evolved? A review of methodological advances in biogeomorphology confirms the continuing importance of field monitoring, and the increasingly tight collaboration between experimental and modelling-based research. Thematically, particularly strong progress has been made in disentangling the complex bidirectional biogeomorphic interactions in coastal sedimentary environments, and fluvial and riparian systems. It is increasingly obvious that variation in ecological traits leads to large differences in biogeomorphic impacts of different species in different circumstances. This poses challenges for applications of biogeomorphology to environmental management and conservation. Seven key topics emerge from this review and provide the basis for a biogeomorphological research agenda to usher in the next 50 yr of progress.",

abstract = "In Re-Understanding Automation and Control in the era of digital automation of societal systems, we need to understand the inter-connected relations between knowledge, culture, technology and society. This in turn demands the exploration of social and cultural architectures, which facilitate them. Whilst computational model of data systems is built upon the bottom-up architecture, it is the top-down architecture of social and cultural contexts that synchronises the processing and outcomes of data systems, may they relate to organisational systems, heath and welfare systems, or institutional systems. It is this notion of the inter-dependence of the bottom-up and top-down architectures that makes us act beyond the linear gaze worldview of automation and control of production systems, and explore the multiplicity of interconnections between and across societal systems. In these horizons, we see the inter-connectedness between the unit and the whole, between the horizontal and vertical, and a symbiosis of hand and brain- an augmentation of the human and the machine. The ideas of inter-connectedness, augmentation and symbiosis lie at the core of holonic horizons. These horizons allow us to transcend the limit of the calculation and control model of automation, and enable the design of human-centred systems that valorise differences whilst utilising the richness and diversity of human-machine collaborations. When we envision these interactions and collaborations as a systems developmental process, we begin to visualise systems design from an interdependent perspective, which goes beyond the linear gaze of “utility”. The paper explores the ways holonic architectures engage us in the design process.",

Over recent years a huge library of DM algorithms has been developed to tackle a variety of problems in fields such as medical imaging and traffic analysis. Many DM techniques are far more flexible than more classical numerial simulation or statistical modelling approaches. These could be usefully applied to data-rich environmental problems. Certain techniques such as artificial neural networks, clustering, case-based reasoning or Bayesian networks have been applied in environmental modelling, while other methods, like support vector machines among others, have yet to be taken up on a wide scale. There is greater scope for many lesser known techniques to be applied in environmental research, with the potential to contribute to addressing some of the current open environmental challenges. However, selecting the best DM technique for a given environmental problem is not a simple decision, and there is a lack of guidelines and criteria that helps the data scientist and environmental scientists to ensure effective knowledge extraction from data. This paper provides a broad introduction to the use of DM in Data Science processes for environmental researchers. Data Science contains three main steps (pre-processing, data mining and post-processing). This paper provides a conceptualization of Environmental Systems and a conceptualization of DM methods, which are in the core step of the Data Science process. These two elements define a conceptual framework that is on the basis of a new methodology proposed for relating the characteristics of a given environmental problem with a family of Data Mining methods. The paper provides a general overview and guidelines of DM techniques to a non-expert user, who can decide with this support which is the more suitable technique to solve their problem at hand. The decision is related to the bidimensional relationship between the type of environmental system and the type of DM method. An illustrative two way table containing references for each pair Environmental System-Data Mining method is presented and discussed. Some examples of how the proposed methodology is used to support DM method selection are also presented, and challenges and future trends are identified.",

abstract = "Context
Software systems today often interoperate with each other, thus forming a system of systems (SoS). Due to the scale, complexity, and heterogeneity of SoS, determining compliance with their requirements is challenging, despite the range of existing monitoring approaches. The fragmented research landscape and the diversity of existing approaches, however, make it hard to understand and analyze existing research regarding its suitability for SoS.
Objective
The aims of this paper are thus to systematically identify, describe, and classify existing approaches for requirements-based monitoring of software systems at runtime. Specifically, we (i) analyze the characteristics and application areas of monitoring approaches proposed in different domains, we (ii) systematically identify frameworks supporting requirements monitoring, and finally (iii) analyze their support for requirements monitoring in SoS.
Method
We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify existing monitoring approaches and to classify their key characteristics and application areas. Based on this analysis we selected requirements monitoring frameworks, following a definition by Robinson, and analyzed them regarding their support for requirements monitoring in SoS.
Results
We identified 330 publications, which we used to produce a comprehensive overview of the landscape of requirements monitoring approaches. We analyzed these publications regarding their support for Robinson’s requirements monitoring layers, resulting in 37 identified frameworks. We investigated how well these frameworks support requirements monitoring in SoS.
Conclusions
We conclude that most existing approaches are restricted to certain kinds of checks, particular types of events and data, and mostly also limited to one particular architectural style and technology. This lack of flexibility makes their application in an SoS context difficult. Also, systematic and automated variability management is still missing. Regarding their evaluation, many existing frameworks focus on measuring the performance overhead, while only few frameworks have been assessed in cases studies with real-world systems.",

System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as “what-if” tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions – for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak—some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.",

Geriatric assessment (GA) has been increasingly recognised as a predictive and prehabilitative tool for older adults with cancer. However, GA has been notoriously difficult to implement in oncological settings due to workforce, economic, logistical, and practical barriers. We aimed to review the heterogenous literature on implementation of GA in oncology settings to understand the different implementation context configurations of GA and the mechanisms they trigger to enable successful implementation. A systematic realist review was undertaken in two stages: i) systematic searches with structured data extraction combined with iterative key stakeholder consultations to develop programme theories for implementing GA in oncology settings; ii) synthesis to refine programme theories. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA, Epistemonikos, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, DARE and Health Technology Assessment were searched. Four programme theories were developed from 53 included articles and 20 key stakeholder consultations addressing the major barriers of GA implementation in oncology practice: time (leveraging non-specialists), funding (creating favourable health economics), practicalities (establishing the use of GA in cancer care), and managing limited resources. We demonstrate that a whole system approach is required to improve the implementation of GA in cancer settings. This review will help inform policy decisions regarding implementation of GA and provide a basis for further implementation research.",

Whereas change is the end result of innovation, this study builds an AR Innovation Cycle (ARIC) model based on Tangkar and Arditi (2000) labyrinth of innovation. ARIC is defined as a flexible loop which allows action (exploration and exploitation Innovation) and research (organizational learning and feedback system) to be achieved at the same time. Transitional process of ARIC is based on organizational learning; efficiently close organization current innovation status to desired innovation status. Organization current and desired innovation status are assessed and defined in terms of two features, structural (Innovation classification type) and content (Innovative Capacity/Capability). Moreover, while organizational learning falls into theoretical discussion and lacks practical guideline, an applied thinking technique is needed to play the role of organizational learning in ARIC. This paper present reasons why developed Lean thinking at the strategic level can be assumed as transitional technique and operationalize organizational learning.",

abstract = "Forecasting soil temperature profile is recognized as vital information for irrigation demand forecast in a modern/efficient agricultural water management framework in arid regions. A new linear stochastic model is proposed to more accurately forecast daily soil temperature (DST) profile at depths of 5, 10 and 20 cm below ground surface. The data used to test the proposed new method is collected from two stations in Tabriz and Jolfa, located in the East Azerbaijan Province of Iran. The proposed new method uses four preprocessing techniques, including spectral analysis, standardization, trend removing and differencing. A total of 1680 different modelling scenarios were performed in this study. The results show the superior ability of the proposed methodology in DST estimation, compared to existing nonlinear methods such as the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), with excellent performance indicators such as the coefficient of determination, mean relative error and the Nash-Sutcliffe index. Moreover, the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) index is employed to compare the performance of the proposed method with MLPNN in terms of both accuracy and easy-of-use. The AICc of the proposed method at Jolfa at a depth of 5, 10 and 20 cm were 176, -2 and -184, respectively, in comparison with 1991, 30 and -57 for MLPNN. Similarly, the AICc index for Tabriz at 5, 10 and 20 cm are 200, 17 and -152, respectively, for the proposed method and 202, 33 and -62 for MLPNN. Consequently, the proposed new linear method is recommended for forecasting daily soil temperature profiles.",

Doing so requires a systemic perspective to embrace complexity and the wealth of interactions characterizing resource governance regimes. The MTF supports and provides guidance for an interdisciplinary approach in the social sciences and across the social–natural science interface. The framework integrates a range of concepts to develop a more coherent understanding of the complexity of water management regimes. Specific emphasis is given to adaptive capacity and learning processes. However, the MTF is not linked to one specific theory but provides a language that can be tailored to specific research questions and different theoretical approaches. The structured yet flexible approach is a condition for developing shared databases that allow comparative analyses over a wider range of case studies. The MTF does not promote panaceas but a diagnostic approach supporting context sensitive analysis without being case specific and thus not directly transferable.",

This paper illustrates a study of TRM in the rubberwood processing industry to prepare it towards a sustainable transition to industry 4.0. The rubberwood processing industry operates using massive production data. Such big data emerge from production using multi-processes because the various products come in different sizes and quality levels (grades). The rubberwood processing company in this study faces significant problems of inaccurate and delayed data. These problems introduce mistakes in inventory management and wage payment. The company also faces an economic issue due to confirmation which is labour-intensive. This study applied the Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique to verify accepted material or woodpiece and use data analytics to improve the efficiency of the verification system. Furthermore, a Web-Based Application (WBA) is developed for production data management. The results show a significant drop in the percentage of data inaccuracy when the GA confirmation method is applied and also a decrease in the percentage of production data discrepancy among processes. This successful sustainable transition is attributed to TRM because the achieved performance improvement enriches effectiveness in production, material, labour and service resources.",

It offers a graphical user interface for students to interact with only the need for any generic WiFi compliant device. Its innovative design allows the instructor to select and combine the developed resources to create varied activities, providing content adapted to every single device. The usefulness of the system was tested by introducing a case study to a group of senior college students. The experience showed that the use of the system helped students to achieve better results in their evaluation. It also showed that the students had no problems interacting with it from the outset, promoting their active learning.

Although this language is adopted by various regulators all around the world and has contributed greatly to semantic interoperability in this field, the variations between taxonomies and also between elements of instance documents, still cause many inconsistencies between elements. Although some existing approaches suppose the conversion of XBRL to ontologies and then resolve the inconsistencies by applying some mapping techniques, it does not seem practical because of low precision and incompleteness of these conversions. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed which utilizes Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in order to detect best semantic mappings between inconsistent concepts of two XBRL documents. This approach analyzes the possible mappings with respect to various factors like concept names, all label texts, presentation and calculation hierarchies and so on. This makes the approach capable of finding mappings, which were not easily discoverable otherwise. The proposed approach is implemented and applied to actual XBRL reports. The results are measured with aid of well-known criteria (precision, recall and F-measure) and are compared with the well-known Hungarian algorithm and illustrate the better performance in accordance with these three criteria.",

This paper argues that critical social scientific perspectives are needed to supplement public health and food focused approaches, which, while helpful, tend to reduce research and intervention to remedial action on malnourished bodies or on food production. A number of alternative perspectives draw on work on both bodies and on systems which are reviewed here. Because both the causes and the impacts of poor nutrition are simultaneously embodied and systemic, our understanding is weakened without considering both sets of literature simultaneously. New-materialist, assemblage or posthuman approaches represent an evolution of these literatures which can reflect on dissolving socio-natural boundaries within contemporary (nutritional) science, whilst retaining a critical edge. Together, the various approaches within this paper help consider the conditions of everyday existence for those living with malnutrition and the range of bodily and systemic factors which assemble their condition.",

abstract = "Current changes in food systems in low- and middle-income countries are not only associated with increasing demand for food driven by population growth. Shifts in diets with different production and processing structures likely have a more considerable impact in future: higher land requirements (e.g., more animal-based proteins) or changing production regions and structures (e.g., higher share of (imported) processed food). Whether the expected transition in low- and middle-income countries that is considerably larger than in high income countries is resilient, is questionable. Beyond, the resilience of food systems is not consistently assessed and hardly synthesized for low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review based on a keyword search was therefore conducted to identify research gaps on food system resilience for low- and middle-income countries. This review identified three clusters of studies: studies in cluster 1 (global models and primary production) mainly model global (change) impacts on crop production, mostly disregard the downstream of the value chain and use globally accessible crop data (e.g., for cereals). Studies in cluster 2 (farmers' behavior under global change) mainly analyze with surveys and workshop formats the resilience of farmers and farming households under global change phenomena such as climate change and equally explore especially farmers’ adaptative capacity. Studies in cluster 3 (food systems and value chains) take a more holistic perspective and mostly qualitatively analyze the resilience of food systems based on existing studies. Quantitatively, most studies model the robustness of food systems and not their transformability. Future research should quantitatively assess the adaptiveness and transformability of food systems and study the resilience of food systems beyond primary production. Studies should quantitatively model the impact between the food system and associated environmental and social systems and along the food value chain to generate relevant insights for food system governance.",

BRs offer a unique opportunity to examine these relationships because they aim to foster more adaptive and collaborative forms of management, i.e. adaptive co-management (ACM). Accounting for the outcomes of ACM is a difficult task and little progress has been made to this end. However, we show here that ACM efforts in all four BRs had a myriad of positive results as well as ecological and livelihood effects. Process variables of collaboration and learning explained over half (54.6%) of the variability in results and over one third (35.1%) of the variability in effects. While the overall models for outcomes and subsequent process were not significant, the regressions revealed predictive potential for both process variables. Our analysis highlights that a better process is associated with more positive outcomes and that collaboration and learning make unique contributions to outcomes. Opportunities for quantitative techniques to be utilized in understanding the dynamics of ACM are illustrated. Understanding relationships between process and outcomes (and vice versa) provides a sound basis to answer critiques, enhances accountability, and maximizes the potential of positive impacts for ecosystems and humans.",

In particular, I investigate the relationships existing between domain experts, playing the role of end-user developers, and meta-designers, mediated by EUD environments, and between end users and end-user developers mediated by EUD products. To this end, three case studies are considered, which belong to the recent research experience in EUD of the author. The case studies are concerned with three different application domains, namely physical prototyping of social products, accumulation and sharing of territory knowledge for first aid intervention, development of e-government services for the citizens of a municipality. The analysis is carried out both on the design process, by adopting a meta-design perspective, and on the product developed in each project, according to a semiotic engineering perspective. The analysis allows to shed light on the human and technical actors involved in EUD and on their communication processes, in order to understand which kinds of interaction visual languages and social conditions should be defined to encourage a continuous user-system co-evolution. As a result, the paper finally proposes some operative indications for the design of systems enabling EUD, which capitalize on semiotic engineering and meta-design ideas.",

Despite the growing interest in areas such as computational linguistics, systematically characterizing and tracking the epistemic status of scientific claims and their evolution in scientific disciplines remains a challenge. We present a unifying framework for the study of uncertainties explicitly and implicitly conveyed in scientific publications. The framework aims to accommodate a wide range of uncertainty types, from speculations to inconsistencies and controversies. We introduce a scalable and adaptive method to recognize semantically equivalent cues of uncertainty across different fields of research and accommodate individual analysts’ unique perspectives. We demonstrate how the new method can be used to expand a small seed list of uncertainty cue words and how the validity of the expanded candidate cue words is verified. We visualize the mixture of the original and expanded uncertainty cue words to reveal the diversity of expressions of uncertainty. These cue words offer a novel resource for the study of uncertainty in scientific assertions.",

Prior attempts to analyze the feasibility of those projects, however, have been subject to limitations in accommodating such environmental changes. As a remedial measure, the combination of system dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (ABM) is proposed due to their complementary strengths. Consequently, this paper suggests a new approach to dynamic feasibility analysis for public investment projects through an integrated simulation model using SD and ABM. The former SD part elucidates the relationships among system elements that constitute project's benefits and costs, while the latter ABM part depicts users’ emergent behavior with their heterogeneity. A bridge construction case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach. The findings show that the proposed approach can provide a valuable and flexible framework for analyzing project feasibility in a dynamic environment.",

The marked explanatory gaps that separate such research from classical neurophysiology and perceptual psychology raise the challenge of integrating knowledge gleaned at multiple levels of investigation into a coherent multidisciplinary account of pain. A conceptual framework from consciousness research, grounded in the concept of self-organization, can address this challenge through nonlinear dynamical systems and related models. We propose a constructivist model that construes pain, not as the passive registration of sensory information that traditional research would presume, but rather an active process of generating and shaping awareness. If pain is a dynamic product of a self-organizing brain, then pain research needs a theoretical framework to address the observations that functional brain imaging yields.",

We argue that these approaches fail to address the key notion of adaptability in the support for decision makers. Instead of focusing exclusively on automation in decision making, we believe it is also necessary to pay attention to the interplay between decision makers and organizational processes. The service oriented view of organizations recognizes the need to accommodate the changing reality of organizational dynamics. For example, the service science approach focuses on interactions between service providers, their clients, and consumers as important interacting components of a service system. Current approaches to DSS design are constrained in terms of their ability to adapt to changes in user requirements and to provide support for the evolution of systems. This situation worsens when resources are distributed at different locations across organizations, decision making processes are required to be integrated at different points in time, and when collaboration is needed among decision makers. However, this typically characterizes the needs of collaborative decision making in networked organizations as exemplified by systems used for supply chain management. To address these problems we leverage the power of services for designing a framework that explicitly recognizes the need for design based on service delivery. We develop an agent-enabled service-oriented architecture to realize the proposed framework with service and agent paradigms. The architecture is refined and validated with an implementation in the supply chain context.",

To address this issue, this work presents a systematic method for supporting the design and automation of unobtrusive routine tasks that can adjust their obtrusiveness level at runtime according to the user attentional resources and context. This method proposes to design the routine tasks that the system must carry out and how they must interact with users in terms of obtrusiveness. The method also provides a software infrastructure that makes the execution of the tasks at the appropriate obtrusiveness degree a reality. Finally, the system has been validated by means of usefulness and performance tests and a practical case study that demonstrates the correctness and applicability of our approach without compromising system performance.",

The practical use of this method has been explored and three case studies are presented from the domains of organisational change and entrepreneurial studies. The value of this method is twofold; (i) it has the potential to improve dynamic sensibility in the process of qualitative data analysis, and (ii) it can provide a more rigorous approach to developing CLDs in the formation stage of system dynamics modelling. We propose that the further development of this method requires its implementation within CAQDAS packages so that CLD creation, as a precursor to full system dynamics modelling, is contemporaneous with coding and consistent with a bridging strategy of paradigm crossing.",

Using a gap function framework or describing the mixed user equilibrium under different information availability over a long-term steady state, a nonlinear programming model is formulated to describe the route choice behavior of the perfect information (PI) and expected travel time (ETT) user classes under stochastic day-dependent travel time. Driven by a computationally efficient algorithm suitable for large-scale networks, the model was implemented in a standard optimization solver and an open-source simulation package and further applied to medium-scale networks to examine the effectiveness of dynamic traveler information under realistic stochastic capacity conditions.",

In supply chains, different structures (functional, organizational, informational, financial, etc.) are (re)formed. These structures interrelate with each other and change in dynamics. The paper introduces a new conceptual framework for multi-structural planning and operations of adaptive supply chains with structure dynamics considerations. We elaborate a vision of adaptive supply chain management (A-SCM), a new dynamic model and tools for the planning and control of adaptive supply chains. SCM is addressed from perspectives of execution dynamics under uncertainty. Supply chains are modelled in terms of dynamic multi-structural macro-states, based on simultaneous consideration of the management as a function of both states and structures. The research approach is theoretically based on the combined application of control theory, operations research, and agent-based modelling. The findings suggest constructive ways to implement multi-structural supply chain management and to transit from a “one-way” partial optimization to the feedback-based, closed-loop adaptive supply chain optimization and execution management for value chain adaptability, stability and crisis-resistance. The proposed methodology enhances managerial insight into advanced supply chain management.",

We argue that transition research, and future studies can benefit from taking complexity theory seriously. In the paper, we elaborate four insights from complexity studies that can move the research agenda of transition studies forward: empirically investigating the degree of complexity of a system; investigating complexity at the level of the policy-making system; longitudinal and retrospective research designs for the identification of transitions; methodological tools which accommodate complexity, such as agent-based modeling and ARIMA modeling. Further, we suggest how these can improve our knowledge of transitions towards sustainable future.",

Effective livelihood changes must be taken to decrease asset losses and to adapt to current or future environmental challenges. However, there are few studies that systematically understand and assess farmers’ livelihood adaptation. We developed an integrated analytical framework for livelihood adaptation and explored the relationships between adaptive capacity, adaptation outcomes, and farmers’ adaptation strategies. We applied this framework to a case study of the Minqin Oasis in China and assessed the livelihood adaptation of farmers facing environmental change and water scarcity. Household surveys and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. We found that (1) farmers’ livelihood adaptation choices were limited due to current government policies and their own resources and (2) livelihood adaptive capacity (such as land, water resources, and social networks) and policy reform (water resource fees, and cultivated land compression) had a key impact on farmers’ adaptation. The factors representing a poor livelihood strategy and adaptation outcomes of the farmer include the following: (1) a low level of livelihood awareness among farmers (such as passive farmers), (2) a lack of livelihood assets, (3) government focus on environmental recovery, and (4) a weakened role of the market. To improve the adaptation of farmers’ livelihoods to environmental change, these measures must balance the relationship between environmental restoration and farmers’ livelihoods, consider a variety of key forces, and guide farmers to adopt effective strategies. This study facilitates the development of livelihood adaptation analysis methods for global change studies. Case-based research results can be used to improve local decision-making and can provide an assessment reference method for farmer adaptation to regional and global environmental change.",

They also act as information channels between corporate entities and various hypotheses have been proposed in the literature regarding effectiveness of board-interlocks. Generally these hypotheses are tested against country specific data over a given time period. Therefore, a network diffusion model of companies, with interlocking directors as the links, would serve as an expert system to test hypotheses and policies in a more general framework. Such a model will also be useful in decision making and identifying organizations and directors for board-interlock for optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-edge directed weighted network model and an agent based simulation scheme for analysing the diffusion process through board interlocks. The general framework introduced in this work is capable of incorporating individual characteristics of directors such as personal identification with a corporate firm. We test the hypothesis that the organisational affinity of interlocking directors does not affect the rate of knowledge transfer using the Indian Company Affiliation Network (ICAN) and the results show that organisational affinity affects the diffusion rate in a statistically significant manner. This is further confirmed with three other random networks of different topologies. The model is also used to simulate knowledge diffusion of the Indian Company Affiliation Network (ICAN) and investigate the uniformity of diffusion rates across various clusters.",

abstract = "In recent years, states have sought to increase accountability for public school teachers by implementing a package of reforms centered on high-stakes evaluation systems. We examine the effect of these reforms on the supply and quality of new teachers. Leveraging variation across states and time, we find that accountability reforms reduced the number of newly licensed teacher candidates and increased the likelihood of unfilled teaching positions, particularly in hard-to-staff schools. Evidence also suggests that reforms increased the quality of newly hired teachers by reducing the likelihood new teachers attended unselective undergraduate institutions. Decreases in job security, satisfaction, and autonomy are likely mechanisms for these effects.",

This paper reviews the research of the past 25 years and summarizes a variety of systems for adaptive control (AC) of machine tools. Special attention is given to the computer used and its role in the system. These systems have not been widely applied because of the high cost of the hardware in comparison to anticipated benefits. With present day computer numerical control (CNC) systems, AC is more easily implemented with lower cost software changes. Further, the increasing importance of unattended operation has greatly increased the expected benefits. Research has shown the need for the development of parameters adaptive systems which are stable and can provide on-line estimates of process parameters. Such control must insure that operations are within the constraints imposed by the machine. Equally important, the control must embody the sensing and measurement required for efficient tool management. That is, the system should measure tool wear and provide for automatic tool replacement. The authors present a state space model and associated methodology to address these issues for a CNC lathe.",

abstract = "The search for human origins in Africa has partly narrowed down to probing into the origins of the modern human lineage and the identification of a set of behaviours that characterises it. Much research effort is now dedicated to coastal southern African Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites. This record is still relatively small compared with the Middle Palaeolithic of Europe, and much of the original sites have been lost due to erosional sea level changes tied to glacial to interglacial cycles. However, more explicit conceptual frameworks for understanding coastal adaptation and its evolutionary role in this region have recently been put forward. Partly stimulated by human nutrition studies, coastal resources, especially shellfish, have acquired an unchecked high status in research agendas. Limited local ethnography on coastal foragers and a lack formalised methodologies for inter-site comparison on coastal resource procurement are evident. In this paper, aspects unique to coastal adaptation with particular reference to shellfish collection are explored. Models on the origin and evolution of coastal adaptations must consider cross-cultural ethnographic studies, move away from the simplistic use of shell densities for evaluating procurement intensity and use the much richer Later Stone Age record as a profitable source for testing hypotheses.",

However, the implementation of BIM in building Operations & Maintenance (O&M) is still limited. Previous research only focused on identifying influential factors for the promotion of BIM use in building O&M without considering the systematic manner and the dynamic nature of technology evolution process. This study thus aims to establish an analytical activity system model (ASM) using the activity theory to analyze the BIM use in building O&M in a systematic and dynamic way. The ASMs (traditional and evolutionary) of two different statuses (i.e., without and with BIM-assisted O&M) and the corresponding evolution processes were established based on the critical process models with actors and activities identified in the 1st round interviews with 14 experts. Then, the contradictions as the drivers of evolution in the ASM from the traditional one to the evolutionary BIM-assisted O&M have been examined based on the 2nd round interviews involving the 14 experts and 32 questionnaire surveys. An ASM based driver model of evolution for the BIM-assisted O&M is finally constructed. 26 innovation-oriented internal drivers and six demand-oriented external drivers have been identified, and 21 recommended actions, with the context of social, political and technical influences, have been proposed correspondingly to enhance the identified drivers to achieve BIM-assisted O&M. These results provide a map for O&M practitioners, policy makers and researchers to promote the implementation of BIM in O&M, and are beneficial to the delivery of BIM in building O&M.",

abstract = "To improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model, this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research, thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents’ landscape decisions in an urban environment. The stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots — varying in size, turf variety, and aesthetic qualities. The discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement, and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice. We prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logit model estimated from the stated preference data, and then coupled it with a water resources model of the Okanagan Basin using the Water Evaluation and Planning System. We then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio-hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand. The results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site-specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs, along with a small subsidy, could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption. Under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment, the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the Okanagan, but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents. This study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use.",

abstract = "The respiratory motor system is a specialized musculoskeletal system that is controlled by a small assembly of neuronal clusters in the brainstem. Its prime function is to maintain CO2, O2, and pH homeostasis in arterial circulation through the motor act of breathing. A longstanding dilemma is that during muscular exercise homeostatic regulation occurs automatically without any apparent feedback or feedforward signals, whereas the homeostasis is readily abolished by exogenous chemical challenge. Recently, it has been proposed that these seemingly incongruous behaviors of the respiratory controller may be a manifestation of self-tuning adaptive control. This hypothesis is supported in part by recent discoveries of various memory systems in the brainstem controller including short- and long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic transmission as well as the dramatic abolishment of homeostatic regulation in mutant mice with targeted genetic disruption of the NMDA receptors. In this paper, we propose a model of self-tuning homeostatic regulation based upon a synaptic adaptation rule—Hebbian covariance learning rule—that has been suggested to underlie many forms of learning and memory in the higher brain. We show that such an adaptation rule may be a useful neuronal substrate for reinforcement learning in optimization tasks. The model demonstrates how spontaneous oscillations and/or random-like fluctuations of neural activity may be exploited by the controller to adaptively regulate and optimize motor output. Such a self-tuning neural control paradigm, which operates without the need for any internal model of the external environment, is generally applicable to a class of steady-state optimal regulation problems with infinite time horizon. An interesting implication of the present results is that brain intelligent control can occur at a subconscious level without the need for voluntary intervention from the higher brain.

Empirical studies examine the behavioral differences between various hyper-heuristic selection operators to better understand their mode of operation.

We analyzed online survey responses from academics representing 22 research institutions and 13 case studies, all from Latin America. Results showed that the generation of scientific knowledge is not integrally approached and there are deficiencies in researchers’ communication with stakeholders across the land-sea interface. These drawbacks in scientific knowledge building could be one of the reasons why an ES approach is rarely applied on governance of land-sea systems. The cases showed segmented governance schemes and that conflict situations enhance the visibility of ecosystem relations. The establishment of long-lasting institutional instruments and the involvement of intermediaries connecting sectors are complementary paths to improve integrated governance. Using ES as a boundary concept could improve integration between sectors and ES trade-off analysis can help to introduce ecosystem relations to stakeholders related to their own interests.",

abstract = "Motivation: Finding the optimum solution of real world complex optimization problem needs efficient solver system. Meta-heuristic like swarm, evolutionary or physics based methods essentially form an expert system which may strive for the search of optimum solution. However, these methods have their own merits and demerits. To supersede the performance of existing systems in context of real time and advanced problems and to propose new intelligent method having an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation phase have become a center of focus of the expert system design. Therefore, being inspired from such a scenario, a hybrid advanced player selection strategy based population search (HAPS-PS) technique is proposed and evaluated in this paper in context of modern applications. Methods: Sport is a multi-functional activity where different learning methods like cooperative, competitive and self-learning variants along with interactive environmental features help to improve the performance of the players. The properties of playing activity and the thematic learning process of sports, along with some features like, chaotic map based initialization, pool based topological structure selection, integration of blended laplacian operator etc. contributes in the design of HAPS-PS. Also a novel mechanism of team reformation through elimination of comparatively poor players and recruitment of new talents is employed. It provides diversification and regulates the search agents in a promising direction. Results: We have comprehensively evaluated the performance of the HAPS-PS by applying it on standard benchmark problems and on various shifted rotated, hybrid and composite problems of CEC2013 and CEC2014. Also some of the competitive problems of CEC 2017 are tested using the proposed method and they are also compared with other state-of-the-art algorithm to validate the efficacy of the system. Further, tests are carried out on some real-world problems from CEC2011 which includes applications related to parameter optimization of frequency-modulated (FM) sound wave, minimization of molecular potential energy of Lennard-Jones cluster, controlling the chemical reactors, and evaluation of the inter atomic tersoff potentials for covalent systems of silicon. The proposed method is also applied on spread spectrum radar polyphase code design problem as a part of real world application. The comparative results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of HAPS-PS.",

The recent emergence of location-based social network technologies has resulted in new modes of ad hoc virtual organizations. Developers appear to improvise systems by cobbling together existing applications and technologies, almost overnight, with uncoordinated contributions rather than traditional designs or project plans. Heylighen theorizes that stigmergic self-organization explains this kind of system development (Heylighen, 2007a, Heylighen, 2007b). As defined by the biologist Grasse, stigmergy has been defined as a sequence of indirect stimulus and response behaviors that contribute to the coordination of actions among insects through their environment, for example termites coordinating their nest building activities (Theraulaz & Bonabeau, 1999). Heylighen likens human cognitive self-organization to stigmergy. In recent years, the advent of distributed ICTs like worldwide internet computing and pervasive ubiquitous networks have made traditional top-down techniques of system development increasingly irrelevant for software application development. Instead, modular, adaptable and self-managing end-user components are combined in mash-ups (Merrill, 2009). Similarly, software development teams are spontaneous and ad hoc, functioning as virtual organizations. In this study, the actions leading to the creation of the Ushahidi software platform and its subsequent adaptations are identified using longitudinal case study methodology and content analysis methods applied to newspaper, magazine, website, journal and social networking publications. Based on a socio-technical theoretical framework, the Ushahidi system is framed as a dynamic, ad hoc virtual organization in the context of emergency response. The actions leading to the instantiation of the Ushahidi system are examined as examples of human cognitive stigmergic response to critical incidents and naturalistic development of complex adaptive systems.",

Based on relevant hashtags and keywords found in the latest news about three different smartphone brands (i.e. Apple, Samsung, Huawei), data mining is used to extract and analyze the tweets with the specific hashtags or keywords from Twitter. To reduce the loss of a significant amount of event related information due to Twitter’s APIs data access restrictions, the concept of refined hashtags and Keywords is also used to enhance the Twitter crawling model used. Sentiment analysis and opinion analysis were carried out based on the refined hashtags with a goal of analyzing people’s emotion towards a specific smartphone brand and on the possibility to predict its influence on aspects of supply chain for enabling real-time adjustments for ensure a robust supply chain model. This effort enabled identifying a new model of smartphone supply chain management with built in social media information flow.",

To study this complex evolutionary process, we built a comprehensive agent-based model of this infrastructure. We used an agent-based modelling framework called MAIA to build this model with the initial motivation that it facilitates modelling complex institutional structures. The modelling experience however proved that MAIA can also act as an integrated solution to address other major modelling challenges identified in the literature for modelling evolving socio-ecological systems. Building on comprehensive reviews, we reflect on our modelling experience and address four key challenges of modelling evolving socio-ecological systems using agents: (1) design and parameterization of models of agent behaviour and decision-making, (2) system representation in the social and spatial dimension, (3) integration of socio-demographic, ecological, and biophysical models, (4) verification, validation and sensitivity analysis of such ABMs.",

A critical examination of the various experiments reveals that there is less support for the application of adaptive manipulations to applied motor skill training than is generally believed. Some apparently favorable experiments have methodological and interpretive flaws that seriously weaken their conclusions. Other experiments that provide tenable support have characteristics that are unique in adaptive training research so that the generality of their data is in doubt. The limitations of the data prevent any firm conclusions being drawn about the efficiency of adaptive training. However a detailed analysis of motor skill theory and research indicates that some adaptive manipulations could be effective. Methodological and conceptual issues that are critical to successfully testing those manipulations are clarified in a discussion of the adaptive training concept. In addition, that discussion outlines several empirical tests that are needed to enable a more effective analysis of adaptive training.",

The purpose of this paper was to realize water conservation on the premise of sustainable economic development. A linear optimization model, based on a dynamic input–output analysis, was developed to simulate the complex interrelationships between water resources and the social economy, and explore the optimal policies. The simulation results show that from 2013 to 2025, the targets of water conservation, including water retention and water environment control, will be achieved with an annual chemical oxygen demand emissions reduction rate of 12.6% and a constant annual real gross regional product rate of 4.3%. The optimal policies contributes to increasing reclaimed water supply, easing the groundwater exploitation, and optimizing the structure of industries and water demand. The evaluation is suitable for simulating economic development with strict constraints of environmental conservation in other regions with insufficient natural resources.",

abstract = "Sustainability enables the present supply chains to stabilize their gains, particularly for those operating in developing economies. Considering the literature on sustainability and supply chain performances, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores appear to be an indicator of sustainability performances. The majority of papers related to sustainability are to assess the sustainability performance using various tools and methods. However, there is limited research that analyses those sustainability assessment results and use the results for improving the future sustainability performance. This research fills this gap by demonstrating the use of grey theory in analysing ESG score for Indian firms. To this end, we study the sustainability performances of 39 firms in the Indian context, listed in the Thomson Reuters ESG scores that are consistently rated for their Environmental, Social, and Governance performances, for a period of 5 years from 2014 to 2018. A grey incidence analysis is used to study the most important indicators or attributes contributing to the sustainability performances of the Indian firms. This is important for the continuous improvement of the firm or its supply chains towards sustainability and to enhance the visibility of supply chains to stakeholders. It is observed from the results of the analysis that the Resource use score, the Environmental innovation score, and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy score emerges as the most important indicators contributing to Environmental, Social, and Governance performances of Indian firms. Whereas, the Shareholders score, the Management score, and the Human rights score appears to be among the least determining indicators, in the Indian context to achieving total Environmental, Social, and Governance performances. The research throws insights into the areas of poor performances of firms to achieving sustainability in Indian context. As we observe that two out of the three identified areas, the Shareholders score and the Management score appears in the Governance performance side of evaluation in ESG, the implications are uncovered in the direction of improving the Governance performance of Indian firms.",

As a society, we consequently face difficult tradeoffs, between massive restrictions of AMU, and maintenance of current and potentially non-sustainable consumption levels. Here, we present the different components to be addressed for assessing the sustainability of AMU in animal agriculture. At first, we describe the interests and limits of existing models identified by reviewing the literature, which could potentially be used to assess AMU sustainability, while allowing the reader to capture in a simple and visual manner the complexity of the issue. We address in the following sections the boundaries of the social-ecological system and the indicators that are required for assessment of AMU sustainability.

abstract = "Deliberations about how to govern complex problems of urban health and wellbeing sustainably have often been implicitly biased by ideas such as being ‘human-scale’ or ‘people-centered.’ With increasing urban populations and increasing urban system interconnectivity, many cities have transformed into city regions or clusters, and the external effects of urban growth are carried mainly by the marginalized and the environment putting urban health increasingly at risk. Here we address the question of why human societies have not been better at collectively adapting to the challenges of urbanization and global environmental change? We build a theoretical framework of multi-level selection, complex systems evolution, and governance, following which we then present ‘human-scale’ and ‘people-centered’ ideas of urban development as expressions of two types of socio-political organization with different degrees of self-organization. We found several reasons for which the maladies of current urban development emerged and the seeming inability to resolve them. First, urban systems became increasingly interconnected and evolved into ultrasocial superorganisms, displaying preference to sustain themselves as a whole rather than their subordinates. Second, the difference in scaling effects between the biological and the social network contributed to the mismatch between rapid urban growth and slow adaptation. Furthermore, institutions of decreased variety reinforce themselves and become dominant, creating a positive feedback mechanism and promoting invasive and exploitative exponential growth, but they also reduce the creativity and resilience of urban systems. We also found that both the “human-scale” and the “people-centered” approaches acknowledge the exponential growth and decreasing variety in urban systems, and advocate for correcting the mismatches. To incorporate people's needs and values for long-term, truly sustainable urban health governance, we recommend combining the self-organizing, evolutionary feature of “human-scale” and the coordinative, political feature of “people-centeredness.”",

abstract = "Much of current research on designing safe organizations centers around the question of how to best manage concurrent demands for stability and flexibility in the face of external and internal uncertainties. Classic approaches to safety management have favored centralized decision-making in organizations which promises stability through hierarchical control and adherence to predefined procedures. Newer research has stressed the need for decentralized decision-making to enable flexibility through fast local adaptations and improvisation in unprecedented situations, thereby confronting the apparent contradiction between safety and autonomy. Especially research on high-reliability organizations (HROs) has aimed to resolve this contradiction by identifying mechanisms for bridging centralization and decentralization through what has been termed loose coupling. However, the contradiction still lives on in many debates in safety research, for instance concerning safety rules, safety leadership, and safety culture. Using these research domains as examples, it is argued in this paper that by distinguishing between process and personal safety and between operational and higher-order autonomy the relationship between safety and autonomy can be better understood and eventually better managed. Moreover, uncertainty is assumed to be a crucial moderating influence in this relationship. Based on this framework, propositions are developed to guide future research towards reconciling safety and autonomy in safety management.",

This review presents a novel application of seven resilience principles to evaluate six coevolutionary models from socio-hydrology. The principles provide a structured framing of resilience grounded in decades of research characterizing social-ecological systems. We find that coevolutionary models incorporate aspects of all principles and that these influence socio-hydrologic system trajectories. Our synthesis demonstrates the potential for resilience principles to serve as a theoretical frame for model design, evaluation, and comparison. We emphasize underexplored dimensions of resilience in the models and encourage future research to experiment with these principles to broaden our understanding of resilience in coupled social-hydrologic systems.",

abstract = "Contemporary business ecosystems are continuously challenged by unexpected disruptive events, which are increasing in their frequency and effects. A critical question is why do some organizations collapse in face of extreme events, while others not? On the other hand, current engineering and socio-technical systems were designed to operate in “mostly stable” situations; sporadic instability and disturbances are at best captured by exception handling mechanisms, focusing on reliability and robustness. Recent and more ambitious design goals, however, aim at building systems that are expected to cope with severe disruptions, and survive or even thrive in a context of volatility and uncertainty. This led to an increasing attention to the concepts of resilience and antifragility. As such, this article introduces the findings of a comprehensive literature survey aimed at shedding light on emerging concepts and approaches to handle disruptions in business ecosystems. Main contributions include a clarification of related concepts, identification and classification of disruption sources and drivers, and extensive lists of strategies and underlying capabilities to cope with disruptions. Related perspectives and approaches developed in multiple knowledge areas are also analysed and synthesized. Finally, a collection of engineered systems implementing promising approaches to increase resilience and antifragility are presented.",

This can be achieved by assuming one model as the primitive, and implementing the other on top of it. The paper introduces the rationale for choosing the time-driven model as the primitive, and discusses why this approach is possibly the most suitable for a wide range of control applications.

In addition, some potential guidelines to assess each key process agent, externality and pillar are proposed. This model considers, on one hand, a Capability Maturity Model integrated-based component and, on the other hand, a statistical-based component which expresses the relationships between three independent variables that encompass a multiple regression linear model and the remaining variables. The statistical relationships were ascertained by the analysis of the results collected from two surveys. Integration excellence may be achieved throughout an itinerary encompassing six maturity levels. Statistically, three variables contribute the most to the latent variable “Integrated management systems maturity”: the audits typology, the integrated vision revealed by top management and the attained level of organizational integration. Based on the revised literature, this appears to be the first attempt to “normalize” integrated management systems, which can be, hopefully, a relevant contribution to this research field enabling the comparison of integrated systems implemented on different companies or contexts.",

Complexity and uncertainty are key constructs frequently associated with the non-deterministic paradigm. This conceptual paper suggests that these two concepts could very well explain and define particularities of both paradigms, and seeks to articulate both perspectives in a contingent model. First, the constructs of complexity and uncertainty are clarified. Second, the role of project managers' mental models in managerial decision-making is considered. In the third part of this article, we propose a theoretical model suggesting that project managers should consider contingent variables to differentiate managerial conditions of regulation from managerial conditions of emergence.",

Various training scenarios will be designed to capture all possible body perturbations, movements, and interactions. A similar agent-based model (ABM) of the training environment will be created to augment the soldier's cognitive competencies. ABM will integrate social systems interaction complexity into the decision makin g capability of the soldier in real time. Automated feedback can be provided using the model developed in the event of any social faux pas via gesture tracking and monitoring cognitive capacity.

This chapter presents a sketch of a metatheory, or conceptual framework, which serve to guide an ecological approach to the study of learning. The chapter provides an understanding of learning in relation to adaptation construed in all three senses. Learning is a process of adaptation that is manifest over relatively short periods of time, within the lifespan of an individual actor. Learning is itself a product of evolutionary adaptation, acting over much longer periods of time. The analysis of both of these aspects of the problem is guided by the nature of the adaptive relationship between the actor and its econiche. Perception works as an adaptive response because it permits the coordination of action in regard to a real environment, and not because it delivers an equivocal central representation of that environment. The most important limitation of natural selection as a mode of adaptation to the environment lies in its very long back-reference period.",

abstract = "“Evolvability” is a concept normally associated with biology or ecology, but recent work on control of interdependent critical infrastructures reveals that network informatics systems can be designed to enable artificial, human systems to “evolve”. To explicate this finding, we draw on an analogy between disruptive behavior and stable variation in the history of science and the adaptive patterns of robustness and resilience in engineered systems. We present a definition of an evolvable system in the context of a model of robust, resilient and sustainable systems. Our review of this context and standard definitions indicates that many analysts in engineering (as well as in biology and ecology) do not differentiate Resilience from Robustness. Neither do they differentiate overall dependable system adaptability from a multi-phase process that includes graceful degradation and time-constrained recovery, restabilization, and prevention of catastrophic failure. We analyze how systemic Robustness, Resilience, and Sustainability are related to Evolvability. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of Resilience as an adaptive capability that integrates Sustainability and Robustness to achieve Evolvability. This conceptual framework is used to discuss nine engineering principles that should frame systems thinking about developing evolvable systems. These principles are derived from Kevin Kelly’s book: Out of Control, which describes living and artificial self-sustaining systems. Kelly’s last chapter, “The Nine Laws of God,” distills nine principles that govern all life-like systems. We discuss how these principles could be applied to engineering evolvability in artificial systems. This discussion is motivated by a wide range of practical problems in engineered artificial systems. Our goal is to analyze a few examples of system designs across engineering disciplines to explicate a common framework for designing and testing artificial systems. This framework highlights managing increasing complexity, intentional evolution, and resistance to disruptive events. From this perspective, we envision a more imaginative and time-sensitive appreciation of the evolution and operation of “reliable” artificial systems. We conclude with a short discussion of two hypothetical examples of engineering evolvable systems in network-centric communications using Error Resilient Data Fusion (ERDF) and cognitive radio.",

While this policy is implemented in several aquifers all over the world, there is a limited understanding of its social impacts, like how compliance and noncompliance behaviors may emerge. This study presents an agent-based groundwater model to evaluate the effects of monitoring and enforcement levels on farmers' social behaviors, namely boldness and vengefulness. The social, economic, and hydrologic impacts of implementing the cap-and-trade policy in the Rafsanjan Plain, located in Iran, are assessed. To this end, the groundwater market model is evaluated under different monitoring and enforcement scenarios. Results show that the efficacy of the cap-and-trade policy in groundwater markets substantially depends on the monitoring level and enforcement power. The appropriate monitoring and enforcement settings can lead to the emergence of a social norm that is enough to discourage violation and can bring about a functioning market in which the farmers can be better off economically, and the annual drawdown can become less severe. Furthermore, water buyback programs can increase market competition, compliance level, and farmers' profits. This study specifically demonstrates that as a result of the implementation of the cap-and-trade policy, social norms emerge that affect the whole system, from farmer agents to the efficacy of the policy. While this study concentrated on the application of the cap-and-trade policy in groundwater management, the results can provide a foundation for specifying frameworks of the cap-and-trade policy for managing other limited resources or greenhouse gasses emission.",

abstract = "This study examined whether a formal invitation to have greater involvement in the nursing home care of their relatives resulted in increased satisfaction in former care-givers. The conceptual framework guiding the study was based on Roy's Adaptation Model of Nursing (Roy 1984, 1989), since it was believed that the intervention might aid the adaptation of family members to the institutionalisation of a close friend or relative. Increased satisfaction with care was measured as evidence of adaptation. In the study, 31 former care-givers were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which was offered greater involvement in care. Of the participants in the experimental group, the four who accepted this opportunity all had relatives admitted in the past 6 months. After 6 weeks there was no significant difference between the groups. Trends suggest that similar programs may be most useful in the early months following admission, while care-givers are in the process of adapting to their new circumstances. It appears that nursing staff must be sensitive to the different needs for involvement in the care of relatives.",

abstract = "There is a worrying divergence between the way that sexual and reproductive health and rights problems and solutions are framed in advocacy at the global level and the complex reality that people experience in health services on the ground. An analysis of approaches to accountability used in advocacy at these different levels highlights the different assumptions at play as to how change happens. This paper makes the case for a reinvigorated approach to accountability that begins with the dynamics of power at the frontlines, where people encounter health providers and institutions. Conventional approaches to accountability avoid grappling with these dynamics, and as a result, many accountability efforts do not lead to transformative change. Implementation science and systems science are promising sources for fresh approaches, beginning with the understanding of health systems as complex adaptive systems embedded in the broader political dynamics of their societies. By drawing insights from disciplines such as political economy, ethnography, and organizational change management – and applying them creatively to the experience of people in health systems – the workings of power can begin to be uncovered and tackled, sharpening accountability towards those whose health and rights are at stake and generating meaningful change.
Résumé
Il existe une divergence inquiétante entre la manière dont les problèmes et les solutions en matière de santé et droits sexuels et génésiques sont formulés dans le plaidoyer au niveau mondial, et la réalité complexe que connaissent les individus dans les services de santé sur le terrain. Une analyse des approches de l’obligation de rendre compte utilisées dans le plaidoyer à ces différents niveaux met en lumière les hypothèses en jeu sur la manière dont le changement se produit. L’article argumente en faveur d’une approche renforcée de la responsabilisation qui commence avec la dynamique du pouvoir en première ligne, là où les individus rencontrent les prestataires de soins et les institutions. Les approches conventionnelles de l’obligation de rendre compte évitent d’aborder ces dynamiques. Beaucoup d’activités de responsabilisation n’aboutissent donc pas à un changement transformateur. Les sciences de la mise en œuvre et les sciences des systèmes sont des sources prometteuses pour de nouvelles approches, à commencer par la compréhension des systèmes de santé comme structures complexes capables de s’adapter et ancrées dans la dynamique politique plus large de leur société. En empruntant des idées dans des disciplines telles que l’économie politique, l’ethnographie et la gestion du changement organisationnel, et en les appliquant avec créativité à l’expérience des individus dans les systèmes de santé, on peut commencer à mettre à jour et traiter les rouages du pouvoir, ce qui accroîtra la responsabilité face à ceux dont la santé et les droits sont en jeu, et déclenchera un véritable changement.
Resumen
Existe una preocupante divergencia entre la manera en que los problemas y las soluciones relacionados con la salud y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos son planteados en el área de promoción y defensa a nivel mundial, y la compleja realidad que las personas presencian en los servicios de salud en el terreno. Un análisis de enfoques en responsabilidad utilizados en actividades de promoción y defensa en estos diferentes niveles destaca las diferentes suposiciones en juego en cuanto a cómo suceden los cambios. Este artículo arguye a favor de un enfoque revigorizado en responsabilidad, que empieza con la dinámica de poder en primera línea, donde las personas encuentran a los prestadores de servicios y a las instituciones. Los enfoques convencionales en responsabilidad evitan abordar esta dinámica; por consiguiente, muchos esfuerzos por imputar la responsabilidad no producen cambios transformativos. La ciencia de implementación y la ciencia de sistemas son fuentes prometedoras para nuevos enfoques, comenzando por entender los sistemas de salud como sistemas adaptativos complejos arraigados en la dinámica política más amplia de la sociedad. Al adquirir conocimientos de disciplinas como la economía política, etnografía y gestión del cambio organizacional –y al aplicarlos de manera creativa a la experiencia de las personas en los sistemas de salud– se puede empezar a revelar y abordar el funcionamiento del poder y agudizar la responsabilidad hacia las personas cuya salud y cuyos derechos están en juego y generar cambios significativos.",

In this method, construction operation data are constantly captured using tracking sensors and the data is then fed into a simulation model for automatic model updating. This adaptive capability allows a pre-defined simulation model to be constantly updated to reflect the changing project environment for more accurate look-ahead scheduling. Compared with the traditional offline simulation that uses stationary inputs, the capability of the proposed real-time simulation to dynamically incorporate new project data and adapt to changes in field operations can improve the accuracy of project look-ahead scheduling. A prototype system and case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept.",

abstract = "Urban energy systems have been commonly considered to be socio-technical systems within the boundaries of an urban area. However, recent literature challenges this notion in that it urges researchers to look at the wider interactions and influences of urban energy systems wherein the socio-technical sphere is expanded to political, environmental and economic realms as well. In addition to the inter-sectoral linkages, the diverse agents and multilevel governance trends of energy sustainability in the dynamic environment of cities make the urban energy landscape a complex one. There is a strong case then for establishing a new conceptualisation of urban energy systems that builds upon these contemporary understandings of such systems. We argue that the complex systems approach can be suitable for this. In this paper, we propose a pilot framework for understanding urban energy systems using complex systems theory as an integrating plane. We review the multiple streams of urban energy literature to identify the contemporary discussions and construct this framework that can serve as a common ontological understanding for the different scholarships studying urban energy systems. We conclude the paper by highlighting the ways in which the framework can serve some of the relevant communities.",

Complexity in a MAS comes from non-trivial dependencies between activities (social interaction), and between activities and environment change (situated interaction). As they are used to manage social (agent–agent) dependencies, coordination artefacts could also be used to govern situated (agent–environment) dependencies. Along this line, in this paper we propose an event-driven architecture for complex MAS that exploits coordination to handle all sorts of dependencies in a uniform way. We first motivate the underlying meta-model and put some well-known agent-based frameworks in perspective, then we discuss its general articulation along with its reification within the TuCSoN coordination middleware.",

Significant strides are being made regarding the potential nutritional significance of aquatic foods for hominin diets, and explicit conceptual frameworks for understanding the evolutionary context of coastal adaptations are also being developed. Finding out when and where systematic use of aquatic resources took place and what constitutes a well-developed coastal adaptation requires a corpus of data that can offer insights into the organization of marine resource procurement. The earliest evidence for the exploitation of marine coastal habitats in the world is found in southern-most Africa (≤164ka), where the most evident and abundant material expression of such foraging adaptation is revealed by marine mollusc shells found in mid to late Pleistocene archaeological sites. Hence, it becomes imperative to understand what can be meaningfully inferred from the variable quantities of such a significant component of early marine aquatic exploitation. This paper approaches the issue of aquatic resource use by investigating one of the most frequently employed quantitative measure for inferring such behaviour, namely shell density. Holocene assemblages from the South African west coast are used as a case study. It is found that shell densities can be misleading for inferring intensity of coastal resource use in the absence of palaeoshoreline reconstruction and when deposition rates are assumed to remain constant and when geomorphological and taphonomic contexts are unknown. Overall, deposition rates of marine shells is a better proxy for comparison between sites and through time, and thus for gaining insight into past marine coastal adaptations.",

Reviewing the recent literature and reflecting on current research, we find that dominant attempts to increase production focus on maximizing control, while insufficient attention has been paid to system resilience, adaptability and transformability. These three core aspects of resilience thinking aim to reduce system vulnerability. We therefore argue for stronger adoption of resilience thinking into research on bio-based production systems. We show how applying resilience thinking helps to address both the production and the vulnerability challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-fertilization.",

However, adequate integration among empirical approaches (monitoring and experimental) and modelling has rarely been achieved in FBR. We offer an appraisal of the issues involved and chart a course towards enhanced integration. A major element of this path is the joint orientation towards the continuous refinement of a theoretical framework for FBR that links theory testing and generalization with applied research oriented towards the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We further emphasize existing decision-making frameworks as suitable instruments to practically merge these different aims of FBR and bring them into application. This integrated framework requires joint research planning, and should improve communication and stimulate collaboration between modellers and empiricists, thereby overcoming existing reservations and prejudices. The implementation of this integrative research agenda for FBR requires an adaptation in most national and international funding schemes in order to accommodate such joint teams and their more complex structures and data needs.
Zusammenfassung
Ein verbessertes Verständnis von Biodiversität und ökosystemaren Funktionen als Basis für Ökosystemmanagement bedarf eines integrierten Rahmens für funktionelle Biodiversitätsforschung (FBR). Dabei gelingt es aber bislang nur selten, sowohl empirische Forschung (Monitoring und Experimente) als auch Modellierungsansätze erfolgreich zu integrieren. Wir beleuchten die Ursachen dieser Schwierigkeiten und zeigen Optionen für eine bessere Integration auf. Ein wesentliches Element ist dabei die gemeinsame Orientierung an einer fortlaufenden Überprüfung und Verbesserung eines theoretischen Rahmens der FBR. Diese gemeinsame Ausrichtung verknüpft das Testen von Theorien und konzeptionelle Verallgemeinerungen mit angewandten Fragestellungen, die sich am Schutz von Biodiversität und ökosystemaren Funktionen ausrichten. Hierbei können existierende Entscheidungs-Unterstützungs-Konzepte eine wichtige Rolle in der Verknüpfung und praktischen Umsetzung der verschiedenen Ziele der FBR spielen. Der vorgestellte integrierende Rahmen bedarf einer gemeinsamen Projektplanung und führt zu einer verbesserten Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit zwischen Modellierern und Empirikern. Dabei werden bestehende Vorurteile und Berührungsängste überwunden. Die Umsetzung dieser integrierenden Forschungsagenda bedarf einer aktiven Veränderung nationaler und europäischer Förderpolitik mit dem Ziel gemeinsame Forscherteams mit komplexeren Strukturen und Datenerfassungsbedarfen zu ermöglichen.",

abstract = "Following its emergence from the field of resilience engineering in 2012, resilient health care has grown to underpin a new paradigm of safety that leverages an understanding of what goes right to improve patient care. The aim of this paper was to review the resilient health care literature via multiple analyses, in order to examine growth and global longitudinal trends through bibliometric analysis and the influence of this body of work through citation and network analyses. We searched five academic databases (Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline and Safety Science abstracts in ProQuest) using key resilience engineering terms, for literature published from inception to October 2018. The search was augmented with a by-hand examination of the four resilient healthcare books published to date. English-language literature in the context of health care, where system agents were humans, and where resilience was the core focus were included, resulting in a total of 197 publications. While the majority of outputs were found to be non-empirical (58.9%), there has been substantial growth in empirical work in recent years. Journal articles (n = 102) were spread widely across 63 journals. The co-authorship network analysis showed a strong clustering around the founding resilient health care authors. We conclude that that resilient health care is maturing, and formalising into a distinctive paradigm.",

abstract = "Objective: To design a framework for creating computational models that support the understanding of emergent mechanisms for non-communicable diseases. Scope: The national and global burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) represent a major public health challenge that undermines the social and economic development in countries with limited resources. For instance, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) accounted for four out of five deaths in Jamaica and it was the most significant contributor to non-communicable diseases. CVDs are caused by a cluster of comorbidities and lifestyle behaviors that interact to promote a vascular risk. However, their combined effect on CVDs have not been established because of interdependency, nonlinearity and feedback loops. In this research, we developed a computational model based on the Overview, Design concepts, and Details (OOD) protocol to understand the emergence of CVDs in the population. The pattern of this behavior is determined by the interaction of causal relationships among the risk factors. This work has inspired a framework that can be used to model the emergence of non-communicable diseases as complex systems. Results: Understanding the behavior of the Jamaican system provided insights to the creation of a novel framework for NCD emergent patterns. The framework could potentially reduce development cost and time of NCD management systems, since it supports an iterative modeling paradigm. The framework is dynamic enough to be applied in different populations, health states, and various NCDs.",

abstract = "In recent decades, the concept of urban space has undergone transition from its traditional physical concept to a social concept that reflects the human context. The transition, which reside in social sciences narrative, defines the human context of urban space from different behavioral perspectives. The analytical frame of this narrative shows that the fundamentally polysemic meaning of the terms space, place and territory are used interchangeably to designate urban space. The urban space is therefore construed as ‘public space’ or ‘urban place’ where community activities find expression. There exists potential concern in the search for sustainable urban development that this social narrative of urban space is most probably not disposed to exact leverage on land use policy for enhanced spatial integration. This paper argue that the social narrative, which sustain conceptual planning, is antithetical to spatial planning and land use integration. The absence of the spatial context of urban space is a fundamental gap in knowledge that subordinates land use integration. Scientists lean on the principle of totality to consider the conception of urban space as a natural system that is compliant with integration. Accordingly, this paper attempts to conceptualize urban space as a natural spatial system that encourages land use policy change in which individual right for instance is subordinated to spatial integration. The paper engages triangulation of mixed research methods to examine existing notions of urban space (environment).",

In this paper, we use agent-based modeling to investigate and understand the roles of green attachment (which encompasses place attachment and biophilia), engagement in local ecological investment (i.e., greening), and social feedback (where individuals who observe greening become more likely to engage in it). We model this social-ecological feedback process, basing our parameters and assumptions on real-world data and grounding our model in the Tremé neighborhood of New Orleans. We find that social-ecological feedback enhances greening overall and leads to larger spatially continuous regions with high rates of greening. We also find that social-ecological feedback leads to tipping points in neighborhood greening, with approximately 30% of households needing to engage in greening for it to reach asymptotically high levels. In addition, when green attachment is high, this leads to more widespread greening behavior. We conclude that social-ecological feedback processes such as those modeled here may play important roles in neighborhood recovery after disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.",

abstract = "In parallel with the observed greater frequency of natural disasters worldwide, there has been an ever-increasing interest in urban resilience and its assessment. Experience obtained in recent extreme events (in particular, earthquakes and floods) has revealed that both the level of preparedness and the response of affected cities were insufficiently high, whereas the recovery process was long and expensive. For this reason improved pre-disaster mitigation actions, as well as smart and strategic urban planning in threatened areas (e.g. in earthquake-prone regions), is essential. For this purpose, a comprehensive review of the existing literature has been performed in relation to the holistic assessment of urban system resilience to natural disasters, with an emphasis on the effect of earthquakes. The main goal of the review was to try to determine how to best assess the resilience of urban systems as a whole, taking into account all of their components, i.e. both the physical components (i.e. of buildings, infrastructure, and open spaces) and the social components (i.e. of the community), as well as the dynamic interactions between them. Besides considering the commonly measured indicators (e.g. determination of the scope of actual structural damage caused by an earthquake), the paper tries to extend the discussion to some indicators which are not so commonly taken into account, by applying a quantitative resilience assessment approach. Based on the results of the described new literature review, a preliminary concept which could be used to assess the seismic resilience of complex urban systems, taking into account all urban components which have been identified as having an important impact on the latter, is presented. This concept consists of three different parts: (i) a probabilistic fragility analysis for each individual physical element (i.e. a building or an infrastructure element), (ii) a composite index methodology for the measurement of community disaster resilience, and (iii) a complex network approach (graph theory) for the assessment of the resilience of urban systems as a whole. Since, in the existing literature, there is a lack of consideration of urban open space, which can have a significant role in the recovery process, it is suggested that, in future research of seismic resilience assessment, such open space should be taken into account, and that an in-depth study of possible recovery strategies be performed.",

Drawing on the ‘right to the city’ literature, I highlight the importance of the ‘right to the island’ in an effort to move beyond the policy imperatives of MIRAB, SITE and PROFIT. Exercising the right to the island involves cultivating radically pluralistic democracy through struggles for alternative island futures.

Simulation results are more conservative compared to those models and show how barriers impact the diffusion of rotor technology, even on favourable shipping routes.

However, the acceptance of fieldbus technology especially for the food processing and packaging applications has been minimal. Because, new processing plants small to large including renovation and modernization sites are emerging almost everyday, there is a pressing need to extensively disseminate the characteristic features, so that the fieldbus revolution can spread to serve the food industries in a bigger way. This paper critically reviews the characteristic features of some popular fieldbus systems while advocating modern networked automation tools and systems scenarios that can meet the FPOM (food plant operation and management) requirements. In particular, the characteristic features of some contemporary fieldbus standards have been comprehensively described. Some applications are highlighted.

Finite element analysis needs additional information about the objects, such as topological and physical properties. This paper incorporates these properties in a CSG representation of solids and provides semantic constraints for manipulating these properties. Such a CSG tree is called a semantic CSG tree. Preserving the semantic information at the nodes of a CSG tree also guides the designer to reuse the analysis of the substructures of that tree.",

Such systems benefit from self-organization as they become easier to manage and more robust against failures. In this paper, we demonstrate the conception of a decentralized coordination process for resource-flow systems and its integration into an agent-based software system. This process restores a system’s functionality after a failure by propagating information about the error through the system until a fitting agent is found that is able to perform the required function. The mechanism has been designed by combining a top-down design approach for self-organizing resource-flow system and a systemic development framework for the development of decentralized, distributed coordination processes. Using the latter framework, a process is designed and integrated in a system realization that follows the former conceptual model. Evaluations of convergence as well as performance of the mechanism and the required amount of redundancy of the system are performed by simulations.",

abstract = "In Indonesia, the rate of accident and serious incident of aircraft have reached alarming stage. National Transportation Safety Committee affirmed that human errors played the biggest role from period 2007 – 2013. Although there are several possible causes for human error, one of the most critical elements is the quality of Aircraft Maintenance Organization, especially the human resources.To get basic knowledge of human factor, the first step of this study is literature study. The literature reviews showed that there are at least four factors that influenced human errors. They are Organizational Design, Safety Climate, Safety Performance, and Safety Outcome. After the factors were discovered, the next step is choosing the methodology. Since most of the literatures used models to describe the situation, this study will use similar approaches. Ostroff et al Model (2003) and Christian et al Model (2009) are chosen among the model because they can represent the most accurate situations in Aircraft Maintenance Organization in Indonesia. To get an added value, after these two model are merged, Principle of Hoffman (2003) is used to give a better and upgraded model. The proposed model is then explained through six proposed hypotheses, in which two of them are the added values. To collect the suitable data for the model, the final step is deciding the operational variables which are described on the form of tables for each factor. Each variable is tested through sub-model. Method used for gathering data is questionnaire which uses Likert scale test. The result of Likert scale test and the sub-models will become the proposed model. The proposed model is expected to give Aircraft Maintenance Organization a better understanding on human error and make them focus their improvement on human factor more so that the rate of accidents and serious incidents in Indonesia can be reduced significantly.",

Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to identify configurations of value proposition characteristics that are effective for focal firms engaging in market-shaping strategies. In our empirical study, we analyze market-shaping actions carried out by 21 case firms using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We identify four characteristics of market-shaping value propositions: (1) enhanced resource integration and related support as the core content of market-shaping value propositions, and (2) collaborative value proposing process, (3) systemic and verified value promise, and (4) new representations used in communication as the design characteristics of market-shaping value propositions. Further, we show that even though value propositions can shape markets without displaying all four of these characteristics, none of these characteristics alone can create all the expected outcomes. Hence, we identify distinct configurations of value proposition characteristics that are successful in either changing the elements comprising the market system or inducing an overall system-level market change.",

We apply an equilibrium solution in such a supply chain network, which works through limited cooperation and coordination along edges (links) in the network. The links constitute the stochastic modelling entities rather than the nodes of the network. We utilise newly developed phase plane analysis to identify, model and predict characteristic behaviour in supply chain networks. The phase plane charts profile the flow of inventory and identify out of control conditions. They maintain quality within the network, as well as intelligently track the way the network evolves in conditions of changing variability. The methodology is essentially distribution free, relying as it does on the study of forecasting errors, and can be used to examine contractual details as well as strategic and game theoretical concepts between decision-making components (agents) of a network. We illustrate with data drawn from supply chain agile fashion products.",

Each of these approaches has clear benefits as well as significant limitations. This review considers concepts and approaches that support the potential for different disciplines to complement each other in developing a more in-depth understanding of farming systems and their adaptive potential. For this purpose, a Mixed Methods Framework is presented, using examples from a pilot study of a New Zealand dairy farm to illustrate the complementarities between the two current approaches. By presenting this methodology in a specific context, the review provides the theoretical basis for a practical way to integrate quantitative and qualitative research for climate change adaptation research.",

This framework synthesizes statistical and anecdotal findings of the occupant behavior literature. Furthermore, it lends itself to occupant behavior researchers to form a systematic way to report the influential contextual factors such as ease of control, freedom to reposition, and social constraints.",

abstract = "One of the conundrums in today's stress research is why some individuals flourish and others perish under similar stressful conditions. It is recognized that this individual variability in adaptation to stress depends on the outcome of the interaction of genetic and cognitive/emotional inputs in which glucocorticoid hormones and receptors play a crucial role. Hence one approach towards understanding individual variation in stress coping is how glucocorticoid actions can change from protective to harmful. To address this question we focus on four hypotheses that are connected and not mutual exclusive. First, the classical Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis, in which the inability to cope with chronic stress causes a vicious cycle of excess glucocorticoid and downregulation of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the hippocampus triggering a feed-forward cascade of degeneration and disease. Second, the Balance Hypothesis, which takes also the limbic mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) into account and proposes that an integral limbic MR:GR imbalance is causal to altered processing of information in circuits underlying fear, reward, social behaviour and resilience, dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and impairment of behavioural adaptation. The MR:GR balance is altered by gene variants of these receptor complexes and experience-related factors, which can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the expression of these receptors. A particular potent epigenetic stimulus is the maternal environment which is fundamental for the Maternal Mediation Hypothesis. The outcome of perinatal gene×environment interaction, and thus of MR:GR-mediated functions depends however, on the degree of ‘matching’ with environmental demands in later life. The Predictive Adaptation Hypothesis therefore presents a conceptual framework to examine the role of glucocorticoids in understanding individual phenotypic differences in stress-related behaviours over the lifespan.",

Urban landscape ecological risk assessment is conducive to identifying high risk areas and guiding risk prevention. However, few studies have characterized the dynamic processes of landscape ecological risk. In this study, taking Beijing City as a case study, the adaptive cycle in resilience theory was incorporated into a risk assessment framework using such three criteria as potential, connectedness, and resilience, together with integrating exposure and disturbance effects of risk sources. This framework contributed to understanding the complex interactions between landscapes and risk effects from a holistic and dynamic view. The results showed that the ecological risk of “potential” and “connectedness” weakened radially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The distributions of “resilience”, “exposure”, “disturbance”, and the final risk, all exhibited a concentric pattern of the higher risk, highest risk, and lowest risk sequentially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The results reflected the facts that residents living in downtowns had taken ecological restoration measures to reduce risk, while continuous urban constructions in outer suburbs increased the risk. In terms of the adaptive cycle phases of ecological risk, Yanqing, Miyun, Huairou, Mentougou, Fangshan and Pinggu districts were in the reorganization α-phase; Daxing, Changping, Shunyi and Tongzhou districts were in the exploitation r-phase; Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Haidian, Chaoyang and Shijingshan districts were in the conservation K-phase.

Using social network, social identity, and relevant attribution and motivation theories, the authors build a conceptual model that explains key outcomes of start-up KTNs. A preliminary empirical investigation of a UK-wide KTN start-up finds evidence that social identification with the network is a key moderating mechanism. Identification plays a practical role in creating positive knowledge-transfer benefits for firms that are central in the KTN's social network. Identification also plays a symbolic role by affecting participants' perceptions of overall KTN performance in light of knowledge-transfer benefits that they received, and as an antecedent to affective commitment to the KTN.",

abstract = "Today, in many organizations, the debate about the difference in core capabilities has become an important factor for market competition. Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented ε-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study.",

abstract = "Large floodplain-river ecosystems are often highly modified to provide services that society desires, yet these modifications can limit an ecosystem’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. The adaptive capacity of an ecosystem, its general resilience, is a conceptual framework for considering how a system will respond to such changes. We sought to apply aspects of three general resilience principles (diversity and redundancy, connectivity, and controlling variables) to our understanding of floodplain-river ecosystem structure and function. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a case study of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). In doing so, we developed ten indicators that highlight important structural and functional aspects of this floodplain-river ecosystem, and likely underlie the capacity of large rivers to cope with environmental change and disturbance. We developed diversity and redundancy indicators for aquatic habitats, patterns of floodplain inundation, and fish communities. Connectivity indicators included metrics of longitudinal and lateral connections. Controlling variable indicators included deviations from historic water surface elevation fluctuations, water clarity, nutrient concentrations, and aquatic invasive species. This set of indicators provides a simple description of the adaptive capacity of four distinct reaches of the UMRS: Upper Impounded, Lower Impounded, Unimpounded Reaches of the Upper Mississippi River and the entire Illinois River. High aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and water clarity, and the scarcity of invasive fish species are all factors that likely contribute to the high general resilience of the Upper Impounded Reach. However, the limited longitudinal connectivity and establishment of a minimum water level for navigation are factors that may inhibit the general resilience of this reach. In the Lower Impounded Reach, there is high within-reach variability for individual indicators such as aquatic habitat diversity, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and longitudinal and lateral connectivity. In the Unimpounded Reach, a high degree of longitudinal connectivity likely enhances its general resilience, but low aquatic habitat diversity, low lateral connectivity, and relatively high number of invasive fish species inhibit general resilience. For the Illinois River Reach, the relatively high fish functional diversity and redundancy likely contributes to its general resilience, whereas high number of invasive fish species, low water clarity, low lateral connectivity, and high range of water levels may inhibit general resilience. Indicators derived from application of concepts of general resilience provide insight into the current coping capacity of the UMRS and identify opportunities for enhancing resilience.",

To better understand system complexity and system response to changing inputs, “connectivity thinking” has become an important recent paradigm within various disciplines including ecology, hydrology and geomorphology. With the presented conceptual connectivity framework on geomorphic change in human-impacted fluvial systems a cautionary note is flagged regarding the need (i) to include and to systematically conceptualise the role of different types of human agency in altering connectivity relationships in geomorphic systems and (ii) to integrate notions of human-environment interactions to connectivity concepts in geomorphology to better explain causes and trajectories of landscape change. Geomorphic response of fluvial systems to human disturbance is shown to be determined by system-specific boundary conditions (incl. system history, related legacy effects and lag times), vegetation dynamics and human-induced functional relationships (i.e. feedback mechanisms) between the different spatial dimensions of connectivity. It is further demonstrated how changes in social systems can trigger a process-response feedback loop between social and geomorphic systems that further governs the trajectory of landscape change in coupled human-geomorphic systems.",

However, to counter the hegemonic voice of mainstream economics and inspire action on climate change and inequality, ecological economics requires coherence to produce meaningful knowledge from diverse research findings. This has to be done in a world that is increasingly complex and rapidly changing. In this article, we argue that ecological economists should keep multiple antennae up to foresee and respond to the uncertainties of rapid change. Methodological pluralism facilitates diversity of thought, which scholars require in times of rapid change. Responding to previous critiques that methodological pluralism lacks philosophical foundation, we offer tentative conceptual and historical foundations. We ground our understanding of reality and how we partially know that reality in coevolutionary thinking. We illustrate how economistic beliefs (Economism), economic knowledge (episteme), and social-economic reality coevolve together with nature to produce the current era–the Econocene. Our historical tale of the Econocene illuminates how the economic-centric beliefs guiding public and academic knowledge reproduce unsustainable and inequitable outcomes. Ecological economists, we argue, should support guiding beliefs centered on the biosphere, equity, and care while practicing a structured pluralism.",

It aims at understanding the complex relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns, identifying the underlying mechanisms and deriving valid predictions for scenarios of landscape change and its consequences. Today, various studies cope with these tasks through so called “landscape modelling” approaches. They integrate different aspects of heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes and model different driving forces, often using both statistical and process-oriented techniques. We identify two main approaches to deal with the analysis of pattern–process interactions: the first starts with pattern detection, pattern description and pattern analysis, the second with process description, simulation and pattern generation. Focussing on the interplay between these two approaches, landscape analysis and landscape modelling will improve our understanding of pattern–process interactions. The comparison of simulated and observed pattern is a prerequisite for both approaches. Therefore, we identify a set of quantitative, robust, and reproducible methods for the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns that is a starting point for a standard toolbox for ecologists as major future challenge and suggest necessary further methodological developments.",

ES respond spatially and temporally to abiotic and biotic variation, and to management. Thus, resistant and resilient ES provision is expected to remain within a stable range when facing disturbances. In this study, generic indicators to evaluate resistance, potential resilience and capacity for transformation of ES provision are developed and their relevance demonstrated for a mountain grassland system. Indicators are based on plant trait composition (i.e. functional composition) and abiotic parameters determining ES provision at community, meta-community and landscape scales. First the resistance of an ES is indicated by its normal operating range characterized by observed values under current conditions. Second its resilience is assessed by its potential operating range − under hypotheses of reassembly from the community’s species pool. Third its transformation potential is assessed for reassembly at meta-community and landscape scales. Using a state-and-transition model, possible management-related transitions between mountain grassland states were identified, and indicators calculated for two provisioning and two regulating ES. Overall, resilience properties varied across individual ES, supporting a focus on resilience of specific ES. The resilience potential of the two provisioning services was greater than for the two regulating services, both being linked to functional complementarity within communities. We also found high transformation potential reflecting functional redundancy among communities within each meta-community, and across meta-communities in the landscape. Presented indicators are promising for the projection of future ES provision and the identification of management options under environmental change.",

abstract = "Since Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) may exhibit different structures and emergent behaviours during different operational phases, while also being safety critical, it is useful to perform systematic safety analyses tightly relying on the functional and components topologies of such systems. Our proposal is to perform FMEA and FTA analyses as soon as possible in the CPS design process in order to identify and mitigate the risks related to some safety critical structures and behaviours. Thus, these preliminary analyses enable to propose relevant design modifications and improvements such as optional or additional redundancies, components repairability capabilities or relevant control strategies, taking into account the complexity and the potential variability of the structure and the behaviour of the systems. This work derives from previous MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) and MBSA (Model Based Safety Analysis) integration studies, performed during the early phases of the design of safety critical mechatronic systems, including interconnection components and multi-physical interactions. It relies mainly on M2M (Model to Model) and M2T (Model to Text) transformations and appropriate SysML metamodeling. The proposed CPS safety analysis methodology is illustrated using an aeronautic industrial case study.",

abstract = "The specialization approach, understood as the process through which firms create specific knowledge and capabilities through learning, is an important factor to understand the voluntary effort they make to acquire the necessary capabilities to compete in a supply chain (SC). From this perspective, specialization is a complex phenomenon that emerges along with learning. Modelling and simulation have proven to be an appropriate methodology for the analysis of such phenomena. Nevertheless, existing models have limitations related to the characterization of their agents and market forces. To overcome these limitations, a characterization of supply chain agents related to coffee and avocado has been proposed based on their innovation capabilities. The objective was to diagnose the capabilities of the actors who compete and collaborate through interaction. The conclusion about the findings understood of how the actors specialize and learn in these supply chains and what their dynamics and behaviours are. It also served as a guide for the policies and strategies to improve the economic and innovative performance of these chains. In addition, through the analysis of the patterns of specialization in SC, it´s shown that they have not accumulated their TCI and, as a result, there is a lack of competitiveness due to the limited adaptation to a competitive environment and satisfaction of market needs.",

In a system where its parts are non-interoperable, the individual parts do not work together, and the full desired functionality is not available. For organisations, which are in a constant flux, support is required to maintain interoperability and keep the organisations' parts from falling towards the above extreme sides. The same is true for organisations as part of an ecosystem, an economic system and a social system to maintain resilience and sustainability. In this paper we derive requirements and conceptualise a multi-faced learning environment to support organisations to keep pace with the permanent changes in their environments, helping to reach a level of sustainability that allows organisations to survive in their environment on the long run.",

This paper comprehensively reviews experimental studies of pedestrian dynamics published between April 2017 and July 2019. The aim is to capture the unprecedented growth of the experimental literature, analyse the ways in which the research landscape is changing and identify the emerging topics. Laboratory crowd experiments were found to be the most popular method among all empirical methods, covering the most diverse range of topics and constituting nearly half of the empirical literature. The use of animal/insect crowd experiments, on the other hand, appears to be on the decline. Virtual-reality and evacuation-drill studies have maintained their popularity. Pedestrian flow at bottlenecks, walking behaviour and route choice persist to be the top conventional topics. However, new research themes have emerged or have notably gained heightened momentum. This includes the evacuation of vulnerable groups (i.e. elderly, children, mobility impaired), vertical evacuation, evacuation under limited visibility, social groups and evacuation training/education. While the top conventional topics are predominantly explored through laboratory crowd experiments, the methods of evacuation drills and virtual/augmented reality are proving more instrumental in studying the top emerging topics. This highlights the complementary relation of various experimental approaches in this field. More work seems to be needed to establish the transferability of experimental findings across methods, geometric layouts, contexts and demographics.",

In spite of this, there has not been sufficient positive change in corporate practice and research indicates that our ecosystems are continuing to deteriorate at an alarming rate. In this study, we analyse the extent to which social-ecological systems (SES) thinking can be used as a bridging concept in transdisciplinary sustainability research, in order to improve corporate sustainability practices. We draw on a case study of the Business Forum in the Sustainable Market Actors for Responsible Trade (SMART) project. The data was collected from two workshops, semi-structured interviews with corporate representatives, and autoethnographic accounts. Our findings show that a successful transdisciplinary research process requires both significant interest and capacity to act on the part of corporate representatives. Enabling factors for such collaboration are mutual understanding of concepts and having sufficient time to invest in the collaboration. We suggest that risk management can be used as a conceptual metaphor to translate SES thinking in order to make it more relevant in the context of corporate practice. On this basis, we conclude that SES thinking indeed can be used as a bridging concept in transdisciplinary research collaboration for corporate sustainability.",

abstract = "Homeostasis is a basic tenet of biomedicine and an open problem for many physiological control systems. Among them, none has been more extensively studied and intensely debated than the dilemma of exercise hyperpnea – a paradoxical homeostatic increase of respiratory ventilation that is geared to metabolic demands instead of the normal chemoreflex mechanism. Classical control theory has led to a plethora of “feedback/feedforward control” or “set point” hypotheses for homeostatic regulation, yet so far none of them has proved satisfactory in explaining exercise hyperpnea and its interactions with other respiratory inputs. Instead, the available evidence points to a far more sophisticated respiratory controller capable of integrating multiple afferent and efferent signals in adapting the ventilatory pattern toward optimality relative to conflicting homeostatic, energetic and other objectives. This optimality principle parsimoniously mimics exercise hyperpnea, chemoreflex and a host of characteristic respiratory responses to abnormal gas exchange or mechanical loading/unloading in health and in cardiopulmonary diseases – all without resorting to a feedforward “exercise stimulus”. Rather, an emergent controller signal encoding the projected metabolic level is predicted by the principle as an exercise-induced ‘mental percept’ or ‘internal model’, presumably engendered by associative learning (operant conditioning or classical conditioning) which achieves optimality through continuous identification of, and adaptation to, the causal relationship between respiratory motor output and resultant chemical-mechanical afferent feedbacks. This internal model self-tuning adaptive control paradigm opens a new challenge and exciting opportunity for experimental and theoretical elucidations of the mechanisms of respiratory control – and of homeostatic regulation and sensorimotor integration in general.",

The CoBL framework is based on: (1) agents to manage individual learners and communities of learners; (2) a shared data model for integrating heterogeneous communities; and (3) a component-oriented development approach.

The use of drugs in high dilutions and the principle of similarity (or “similia”) are two basic tenets of homeopathy. However, the plausibility of both is a subject of debate. Although several models have been proposed to explain the similia principle, it can be best understood and appreciated in the framework of complexity science and dynamic systems theory. This work applies a five-node Boolean network to show how self-organization and adaptation are relevant to rationalizing this traditional medical principle. Simulating the trajectories and attractors of the network system in the energy state-space provides a rudimentary and qualitative illustration of how targeted external perturbations can have pathological effects, leading to permanent, self-sustaining alterations. Similarly, changes that conversely enable the system to find its way back to the original state can induce therapeutic effects, by causing specific shifts in attractors when suitable conditions are satisfied. Extrapolating these mechanisms to homeopathy, we can envisage how major changes in the evolution of homeodynamic systems (and, eventually, healing of the entire body) can be achieved through carefully selected remedies that reproduce the whole symptom pattern of the ill state.",

Research gaps were identified through an analysis of the alignment of the research field with the research agenda of the Sustainability Transitions Research Network (STRN) and its research themes i.e. implementation strategies for managing transitions; power and politics; civil society, social movements and culture in transitions; role of industries and firms in transitions; transitions in everyday life and practice (sustainable consumption); geography of transitions; and modelling transitions. The strand of research on agro-food sustainability transitions is multifaceted and diverse; it addresses all the themes of the STRN's research agenda. However, it focuses on transition management and sustainable consumption, while it largely underserves the themes dealing with the role of civil society and firms in transitions as well as the geography of transitions. Therefore, research on agro-food sustainability transitions should fill research gaps relating to agency (cf. role of social movements and civil society, firms and industries, etc.) and spatiality/geography in transitions. The paper suggests that these two research topics should be addressed in an articulated research agenda that accommodates the peculiarities of sustainability transitions processes in the agro-food system.",

This article proposes a new framework combining three concepts and related foundational theories: visitor flows, trajectories, and corridors. In tandem, they describe how tourism manifests itself in space and time. Trip decision, trip execution, and tourist performance unfold through social mechanisms generating the totality of visitor flows. Stakeholders must understand how visitor flows in their destinations emerge and evolve in order to decide on specific design interventions.",

This research identified and analyzed various topics related to the supply chain innovation construct and showed that supply chain innovations can be studied at multiple analytical levels. It also revealed that the field has largely relied on manufacturing firm-based samples and U.S. samples, limiting the generalizability of the findings. The identification and analysis of relevant articles highlighted the need to conceptualize the supply chain innovation construct and develop measurement scales to operationalize it. This literature review is the first to focus on supply chain innovations, summarizing the development of the last 18 years and providing fruitful opportunities for future research.

abstract = "The Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park (SSLMP) and the adjacent Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the St. Lawrence Estuary, in Quebec, cover a territory of exceptional biodiversity including 12 species of marine mammals, nearly half of which are considered to be endangered species. Whale-watching trips and other human activities related to commercial shipping, tourism, and recreation generate very intensive traffic in the area, which pose cumulative threats to the marine wildlife. This study has been undertaken in collaboration with the Marine Park and the MPA managers to develop a multi-agent system (MAS) to investigate the interactions between the traffic and the marine mammals in the estuary. This paper describes the first prototype version of the proposed MAS model where the focus is on the whale-watching boats. It discusses the conceptual model with its principal components: the physical environment and the boat agents and whale entities, and the implementation of the model with the behavior rules of the agents. In this version of the MAS, the whale-watching boats are represented as cognitive agents while the whales are simple reactive entities. The prototype model was implemented in the agent-based modeling platform RePast. An index, the happiness factor (i.e., the ratio of whale observation time over the trip duration) was designed to measure how successful the boat agents are in achieving their goal. Simulations were run to assess different decision strategies of the boat agents and their impacts on the whales. Results show that cooperative behavior that involves a combination of innovator and imitator strategies yields a higher average happiness factor over non-cooperative, purely innovators, behavior. However, this cooperative behavior creates increased risk for the whale populations in the estuary.",

abstract = "There are four crucial challenges for environmental toxicologists in the next decade: (1) understanding the mechanisms of molecular and subcellular interactions with pollutant chemicals, including genomic and proteomic aspects; (2) the development of predictive simulation models of toxic effects on complex cellular and physiological processes; (3) linking molecular, cellular and patho-pysiological ‘endpoints’ with higher level ecological consequences; and (4) precautionary anticipation of possible harmful impacts of novel developments in industrial processes, including biotechnology and nanotechnology. One of the major difficulties in ecotoxicology is to link harmful effects of chemical pollutants in individual animals and plants with the ecological consequences. Consequently, this obstacle has resulted in a ‘knowledge-gap’ for those seeking to develop policies for sustainable use of resources and environmental protection. The overall problem is: how to develop effective procedures for environmental/ecological impact and risk assessment? However, the use of diagnostic ‘clinical-type’ tests or ‘biomarkers’ has started to provide information on the health-status of populations based on relatively small samples of individuals. Also, biomarkers can now be used to begin to link processes of molecular and cellular damage through to the higher levels (i.e. prognostic capability), where they can result in reduced performance and reproductive success. Research effort to meet this challenge must be inter-disciplinary in character, since the key questions mainly involve complex interfacial problems. These include effects of physico-chemical speciation on uptake and toxicity, the toxicity of complex mixtures; and linking the impact of pollutants through the various hierarchical levels of biological organisation to ecosystem and human health. Finally, the development and use of process-based computational simulation models (i.e. ‘virtual’ cells, organs and animals), illustrated using an endosomal/lysosomal uptake and cell injury model, will facilitate the development of a predictive capacity for estimating risk associated with the possibility of future environmental events.",

It is a complex problem to search, schedule, and coordinate a set of services from a large number of service resources under various constraints and uncertainties. Existing approaches to this problem have relied on complete information regarding service requirements and resources, without adequately addressing the dynamics and uncertainties of the environments. The real-world situations are complicated as a result of ambiguity in the requirements of the services, the uncertainty of solutions from service providers, and the interdependencies among the services to be composed. This paper investigates the complexity of supply chain formation and proposes an agent-mediated coordination approach. Each agent works as a broker for each service type, dedicated to selecting solutions for each service as well as interacting with other agents in refining the decision making to achieve compatibility among the solutions. The coordination among agents concerns decision making at strategic, tactical, and operational level. At the strategic level, agents communicate and negotiate for supply chain formation; at the tactical level, argumentation is used by agents to communicate and understand the preferences and constraints of each other; at the operational level, different strategies are used for selecting the preferences. Based on this approach, a prototype has been implemented with simulated experiments highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.",

However, there is still no consensus on how resilience should be assessed despite the release of numerous theoretical papers on the topic. Various measurement frameworks and recommendations have emerged, but their applicability is yet to be critically assessed. Using a comprehensive review and a systematic selection approach, we review resilience assessment tools developed for the context of climate change and agricultural development, and their linkages to theoretical frameworks, with a particular focus on the choice of indicators and the scale and methods of measurement. Fifteen tools originating from diverse organizations were selected and evaluated according to a measurement framework. Our study finds that, while some of the tools remain embedded in classical approaches, by simply adding a resilience lens to previous tools and by recycling indicators, others demonstrate a true attempt to re-think in order to account for resilience dimensions. We conclude that for the use of resilience assessment tools, a major challenge is to ensure that simple and operational tools can address complexity. Full baseline should comprise both quantitative and qualitative data collection, and include more systemic indicators as well as indicators of stability and shocks. Changes should be tracked with regular monitoring and evaluation using simple tools based on key variables that capture short-term adaptive processes and changes in states, at the appropriate system level. Clear pathways to human well-being, including transformation, should be discussed through system-oriented approaches, to discard potential undesired resilient states. Finally, robust outcome and impact records from the use of these tools are needed to demonstrate whether the resilience concept is useful over time in driving development into more desirable paths.",

abstract = "In the Pampean region of Argentina, uncultivated areas with spontaneous vegetation, such as the sierras (low hills), are important sites for nature conservation. In the last decades, the “agriculturization” process has generated different pressures on these areas and their fate depends on farmers' decision making. In order to understand the context of these decisions, it is important to know the farmers' demographic characteristics and perceptions of ecosystem services (ES). The aim of this study was to explore the link between farmers' management decisions and their demographic characteristics and perceptions of ES in one of the most intensively cropped areas in Argentina. Data were obtained from 40 semi-structured interviews with farmers from the Tandilia system in the Pampean region. A typology of farms was generated according to their management practices and then characterized by the farmers' demographic characteristics and perceptions of ES. The results show a typology of four groups of farms defined by the combination of eight management variables. The demographic characteristics of the farmers that have a strong perception of ES derived from the sierras were related to an emotionally and/or physically close connection with the farm (their parents were farmers, they were raised on the farm, they have worked there for many years, the farm is their place of residence, and it is a family farm). However, neither the farmers' demographic characteristics nor their perceptions of ES were related to their management decisions. This is explained by the fact that the agricultural model that characterizes the region generates different pressures on farmers and leaves them with little choice in the matter of productive management decisions. The information derived from this work could contribute to the design of guidance criteria for sound environmental management strategies and policy instruments for the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of ES in a context with particular ecological, social, and economic characteristics.",

abstract = "The sustainability of water resources depends on the dynamic interactions among the environmental, technological, and social characteristics of the water system and local population. These interactions can cause supply-demand imbalances at diverse temporal scales, and the response of consumers to water use regulations impacts future water availability. This research develops a dynamic modeling approach to simulate supply-demand dynamics using an agent-based modeling framework that couple models of consumers and utility managers with water system models. Households are represented as agents, and their water use behaviors are represented as rules. A water utility manager agent enacts water use restrictions, based on fluctuations in the reservoir water storage. Water balance in a reservoir is simulated, and multiple climate scenarios are used to test the sensitivity of water availability to changes in streamflow, precipitation, and temperature. The framework is applied to the water supply system in Raleigh, North Carolina to assess sustainability of drought management plans. Model accuracy is assessed using statistical metrics, and sustainability is calculated for a projected period as the satisfaction or deficit of meeting municipal demands. Multiple climate change scenarios are created by perturbing average monthly values of historical inflow, precipitation, and evapotranspiration data. Results demonstrate the use of the agent-based modeling approach to project the effectiveness of management policies and recommend drought policies for improving the sustainability of urban water resources.",

abstract = "Evaluating the performance of supply chains (SC) is a critical activity to enhance the outcomes of operations along the SC tiers. In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR® model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR® metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others.",

In view of this, a Mutation-based Self Regulating and self-Perception Particle Swarm Optimization (MSRSP-PSO) algorithm is proposed in order to explore the effective sampling strategy as well as to estimate and localize the optimum position of the target object. In conjunction with the optimization technique, an effective appearance model is also used for the reinforcement of tracker to achieve better accuracy. The appearance model is constructed with the joint distribution of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP)/Local Contrast Measure (LCM) based texture description and the Ohta color features. In pursuance of validating the efficacy of the proposed tracking algorithm, performance of other state-of-the-art methods such as, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based tracking, Sequential Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) based tracking, and Adaptive Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization (AGPSO) based tracking algorithms are compared with the proposed tracking algorithm. Both the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the experiments, validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.The performance measures include the convergence rate, center location error and the coverage test (PASCAL SCORE). Furthermore, the non-parametric statistical analysis using the Sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, is also figured out to validate the statistical superiority of the proposed MSRSP-PSO algorithm over others. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly track single as well as multiple similar objects with complex interaction.",

abstract = "The biosphere faces an uncertain future! Embracing change, uncertainty and complexity calls for creative transformative pathways. Biosphere stewardship provides a novel multi actor approach towards sustainability. Despite the critical role of individual environmental stewards, biosphere stewardship emphasizes the importance of collective action, and therefore governance. Biosphere stewardship denotes novel governance configurations with the capacity to effectively approach to sustainability transformation. In this paper we seek to advance understanding of how biosphere stewardship actively shapes trajectories of change to foster social-ecological resilience and human wellbeing. Considering the crucial role of governance and more specifically its two pillars of collaboration and learning, we conduct our study of biosphere stewardship through the lens of adaptive co-management. We first set out a framework for diagnosing and analyzing the process of biosphere stewardship. Secondly, we provide evidenced-based insights from applying the framework in four UNESCO biosphere reserves situated in Canada and Sweden to shed light on how active collective shaping of biosphere stewardship occurs and what it produces. In view of the lack of framework for environmental stewardship, we suggest that the present study makes a considerable contribution by providing an appropriate holistic and systemic framework with operational measures. The study also highlights how the comprehensive and consensual understanding of stewardship is proving to be a means of catalyzing biosphere stewardship by enabling effective crafting of policy design and strategic interventions. Moreover, the application of the framework to four case studies reveals the importance of the governance process attributes (collaboration and learning) in mediating outcomes from biosphere stewardship. Finally, the framework provides the basis to address new stewardship enquiries, which require further research in this field.",

The level of specialisation of tourists visiting a destination can influence both the exploitation of the wildlife and the socio-economic success of the industry, and no single governance structure leads to sustainability in every stage of a WT destination lifecycle.

In particular, accurate G models are required to monitor and forecast local electricity demand. However, G forecasting is a multivariate problem, and thus models must employ robust pattern recognition algorithms that can detect subtle variations in G due to causal factors, such as climate variables. Therefore, this study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model that used climatic variables for 6-hour (h) and daily G forecasting. The input variables included the six most relevant climate variables from Scientific Information for Land Owners (SILO) and 51 Reanalysis variables obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) models. This information was used to forecast G data obtained from the energy utility (Energex) at 8 stations in southeast Queensland, Australia, by utilizing statistically significant lagged cross-correlations of G with its predictor variables. The developed ANN model was then benchmarked against multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), multiple linear regression (MLR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models using various statistical metrics, such as relative root-mean square error (RRMSE%). Additionally, this study developed a hybrid ANN model by combining the forecasts of the ANN, MARS, and MLR models. The bootstrap (B) technique was also used with the hybrid ANN model, creating the B-hybrid ANN, to estimate the forecast uncertainty. According to both forecast horizons, the results indicated that the ANN model was more accurate than the ARIMA, MARS, and MLR models for G forecasting. Furthermore, the hybrid ANN was the most accurate model developed in this research study. For example, at the best site (Redcliffe), the hybrid ANN model generated an RRMSE of 3.85% and 4.37% for the 6-h and daily horizons, respectively. This study found that an ANN model could be used for accurately forecasting G over multiple horizons in southeast Queensland.",

abstract = "Policies directing agencies and public land managers to incorporate climate change into management face several barriers. These stem, in part, from a disconnect between the information that is produced and the information needs of local resource managers. A disproportionate focus on the natural and physical sciences in climate vulnerability and adaptation assessment obscure understandings of complex social systems and the interactions and feedbacks in social-ecological systems. We use a qualitative case study of bison management on Department of the Interior-managed and tribal lands to explore how a social-science driven Determinants and Analogue Vulnerability Assessment (DAVA) can inform ecological response models, specifically simulation models that account for multiple drivers of change. First, we illustrate how a DAVA approach can help to: 1) identify key processes, entities, and interactions across scales; 2) document local impacts, indicators, and monitoring efforts of drought and climate; and 3) identify major tradeoffs and uncertainties. We then demonstrate how qualitative narratives can inform simulation models by: 1) prioritizing model components included in modeling efforts; 2) framing joint management and climate scenarios; and 3) parameterizing and evaluating model performance. We do this by presenting a conceptual joint agent-based/state-and-transition simulation modeling framework. Simulation models can represent multiple interacting variables and can identify surprising, emergent outcomes that might not be evident from qualitative analysis alone, and we argue that qualitative case studies can ground simulation models in local contexts and help make them more structurally realistic and useful. Together, these can provide a step toward developing actionable climate change adaptation strategies.",

As the financial crisis hits and resilience management financing cools down it reminds a sick person whose body temperature is too low. The degree indicated by the Recommender Thermometer for Measuring the Preparedness for Flood Resilience Management with a scale between Tmin=34,0̊ and Tmax=42,0̊ shows either cool or overheated preparedness for flood resilience management. The formalized presentation of this research shows how changes in the micro, meso and macro environment of resilience management and the extent to which the goals pursued by various interested parties are met cause corresponding changes in the “temperature” of the preparedness for resilience management. Global innovative aspects of the Recommender Thermometer developed by the authors of this paper are, primarily, its capacity to measure the “temperature” of the preparedness for flood resilience management automatically, to compile multiple alternative recommendations (preparedness for floods, including preparing your home for floods, taking precautions against a threat of floods, retrofitting for flood-prone areas, checking your house insurance; preparedness for bushfires, preparedness for cyclones, preparedness for severe storms, preparedness for heat waves, etc.) customised for a specific user, to perform multiple criteria analysis of the recommendations, and to select the ten most rational ones for that user. Across the world, no other system offers these functions yet.

The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have limited resources and therefore, would like to see the benefits from investments before allowing adopting SMS. This study uses a combination of exploratory and empirical research design to identify and validate the performance measures relevant to the evaluation of SMS investments in auto-component manufacturing SMMEs based in India. The study found that an Industry 4.0 enabled SMS offer more competitive benefits compared to a traditional manufacturing system. The planned investments in SMS can be evaluated on ten performance dimensions namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis & prognosis, computing, social and ecological sustainability. Proposed novel Smart Manufacturing Performance Measurement System (SMPMS) framework is expected to guide the practitioners in SMMEs to evaluate their SMS investments.",

The case study approach was used to study five coastal communities in northwestern Sri Lanka. Shrimp farmers’ start-up motives include both the desire to capitalize on opportunities to utilize their resources and skills (opportunity-driven) and the need to establish satisfactory sources of income (necessity-driven). They have come up with diverse entrepreneurial responses to face various stressors and shocks by using their existing capital types and their willingness for collaboration. Farmers’ coping capacity is demonstrated through their individual responses whereas adaptive and transformative capacities are demonstrated mostly through their community cooperative work. Findings also reveal that the start-up motives of small-scale shrimp farmers are less influential on their social-ecological resilience in the community setting. Instead, the key to social-ecological resilience lies with the understanding of the nature of stressors and their commitment for collective action.",

Four main issues must be addressed: (1) determining the limits and scope of the system to be designed; (2) identifying stakeholders related to the system and their role in the system design; (3) handling the process' different types of knowledge; and (4) emphasizing that performance management systems, key performance indicators (KPIs), and leadership are also part of the system design and must be given attention.

We present a Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) framework to integrate models of human and natural landscape formation processes in the mid to late Holocene on the Talgar alluvial fan on the north slope of the Tian Shan Mountains in the area known as “Semirech’ye” (“Seven Rivers”). We compare our model to the physical evidence from sediment profiles and the archaeological record of subsistence and settlement over the Holocene. The resulting coupled model situates “niche construction theory” and the idea of “transported landscapes” within the SES perspective to focus on how couplings and feedbacks between humans and biophysical processes create or limit opportunities for different modes of subsistence over time, especially during periods of expansion and colonization of new territories. In the Talgar region, we hypothesize that initial, low-level human manipulations of surface water flow across an alluvial fan coupled with aeolian and fluvial sediment dynamics in a series of positive feedbacks to increase the possibilities for agricultural production over time. The human niche in Talgar therefore became increasingly sedentary and agricultural in emphasis compared to niches constructed in other parts of Central Eurasia.",

This paper contributes to this debate by investigating the micro-level interactions among stakeholders during the conceptualisation of a large collaborative project: a Cultural District. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) the research shows that, though rigid sequential planning is not viable, conceptualisation is facilitated by deploying three ANT rules: enrolling actors, fact-building and circulating translations. These rules are used to define a “conditional path” whereby specific actions are activated when controversies emerge.",

A newly introduced concept can introduce new meaning that is disparate to existing understanding. A new concept may also be interpreted in multiple ways, thereby introducing several disparate meanings. The disparity is resolved through adaptation. The disparity introduces complex adaptive behavior to the organization, requiring suitable changes to its management and design. The development of corresponding doctrine for new concepts, and training for the organization's constituents become indispensable. In so doing, constituents can be involved in the adaptation process through direct participation, and thereby include the cognitive dimension. In this paper we present a means by which the complex adaptive behavior exhibited by an organization when new concepts and ideas are introduced can be studied. We apply the Pragmatic Idealism framework, which provides a theoretical construct where the domain of awareness is an abstraction of reality. This framework supports the coexistence of multiple perspectives and understanding. The framework allows for perspectives that are intrinsically correct, yet holistically incomplete. It includes the human cognitive component into cyber physical system providing a bridge between the physical and information dimensions.",

Strategies for coping with foreseeable risks can be developed using management science approaches keeping in mind that costs of controlling risks must fit with expected benefits. Most risks and their control however need to be framed not as technical issues but as managerial problems. Some risks can be mastered by direct allocation and mitigation. Others are best controlled if shifted to co-specialized players with competencies, interest and knowledge. Still others need to be diversified through financial instruments. Finally, a number of thorny risks can only be tackled by influencing drivers and institutions which push risks upward. A process to cope with these varied risks is proposed.",

This qualitative study aimed to explore how Turkish women experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy based on the Roy Adaptation Model.
Methods
To collect data, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 pregnant women who had nausea and vomiting. The sample of the study included pregnant women who were in their first 12 weeks of gestation, did not have medical problems and had nausea, retching and/or vomiting for at least the last 3 days. Data were collected in semi-structured interview form based on the Roy Adaptation Model and with a background data sheet. Data were analyzed using direct content analysis.
Results
Data were classified into four adaptive modes according to the Roy Adaptation Model. The behaviors in the physiological mode were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, inadequate nutrition, inguinal pain, burning sensation and irritation in the throat, ketosis, and urinary incontinence. The behaviors in the self-concept mode were feeling weak, crying, inadequate self-care, changes in sexual intercourse, and social isolation. The behaviors in the role function mode were being unable to fulfill the responsibilities at home and work. The behaviors in the interdependence mode were dissatisfaction with relationships.
Conclusion
The study findings help nursing staff detect the stimuli and the behaviors of pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Further research may evaluate the impact of a counseling program prepared under the guidance of a nursing model on nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.",

Persisting disparities in maternal and child health outcomes in high income countries require new insights for health service response.
Background
Significant social hardship, including factors related to migration, are associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality. The universality of maternity and child health care offers opportunities to reduce health disparities. Process evaluation of health service initiatives to address refugee health inequalities in Melbourne, Australia, is the setting for the study.
Aim
To explore the views of health service leaders about health system and service capacity to tailor care to address social adversity and reduce disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.
Methods
In-depth interviews with leaders of maternity and maternal and child health services with questions guided by a diagram to promote discussion. Thematic analysis of transcribed interviews.
Findings
Health care leaders recognised the level of social complexity and diversity of their clientele. The analysis revealed three key themes: grappling with the complexity of social disadvantage; ‘clinical risk’ versus ‘social risk’; and taking steps for system change.
Discussion
Priority given to clinical requirements and routine practices together with the rising demand for services is limiting service response to families experiencing social hardship and hampering individualised care. System change was considered possible only if health service decision makers engaged with consumer and community perspectives and that of front-line staff.
Conclusion
Achieving equity in maternal and child health outcomes requires engagement of all key stakeholders (communities, clinicians, managers) to facilitate effective system re-design.",

Achieving sustainability in buildings would tackle through energy conservation and waste savings. In most of the industrialised countries, rising energy costs make indoor artificial lightings as a significant contributor. Thus, visual comfort within the indoor environment could be affected by an energy-saving strategy. This paper organises a systematic state of the art review of indoor lighting simulation related to the buildings research. Simulation allows artificial objects and dynamical role variations to optimise the maximal use of lighting systems in buildings. Thus, it allows equivalent lighting system design and the synthetic environment in a virtual world. This strategy makes it possible to design and select the subjective state of the physical and virtual well-being of the visual comfort in the buildings. The main objective of this paper is to find out the most popular simulation tool adopted for the simulation of lighting in the building prototypes by various researchers. The simulation platforms are categorised in simple tools and integrated tools. The survey comprises of seventy papers which were thoroughly reviewed. It is observed that various relevant studies were carried out by different researchers in the energy savings and lighting in buildings and their prototypes were found during the survey. This research can positively aid the researchers and energy managers in deciding the feasible simulation tool for simulating their respective prototypes.",

A growing number of publications is concerned with these factors. Yet, this emerging field of research lacks a common framework that supports researchers in interpreting their findings, such as generalizability to other cities, and making informed decisions on their research design. Aiming to contribute to building such a framework, we systematically reviewed urban metabolism literature. This review paper presents an overview of factors influencing urban water and energy consumption and their effect on consumption, and it describes the interconnectedness of these factors for six different types of relationships. Results disclose fourteen drivers, changes in societal context that shape consumption patterns, and twenty-one facilitators/constraints. The latter type of factors include consumer, resource and urban landscape characteristics that affect resource consumption by facilitating or constraining specific activities. Findings indicate commonalities between primary studies in terms of prevalent observed effect direction for a given factor. However, the interconnections between different factors can influence the direction and magnitude of effects and thereby result in case-specific variability in consumption patterns. Future research should enhance the understanding of these interconnections, strengthen the evidence for the factors presented here and provide insight in additional factors of influence. It is essential to align these studies in terms of a common terminology, transparent quality assessment and a unified approach to measuring and expressing factors of influence. Connecting with related disciplines working on a common systems approach is key to realize the full potential of urban metabolism research to advance our understanding of cities.",

In addition, evolutionary theorizing offers suggestions for extending current theoretical frameworks of transitions. Group selection provides a good example. We review the small set of formal evolutionary models of sustainability transitions, and show that existing formal evolutionary models of technological, social and institutional change can provide useful inputs to transition research and management.",

With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960–1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social–ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge–system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.",

The predictions are based on a regional carbon (C) model that emphasizes the mire-type differences in ecohydrology and biogeochemistry. The model was validated by field measurements performed at multiple sites in Finland. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CO2 flux was more sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in precipitation, and this temperature sensitivity is greater in fens than in bogs. Conversely, the CH4 emission from pristine fens is more sensitive to the changes in precipitation and temperature than pristine bogs. The spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were calculated based on the country-scale patterns of mire properties (i.e., fen-bog types, vegetation, topography and peat texture) and the ACCLIM climate change scenarios. The results indicate a decreasing CO2 sinks in the country-scale peatlands, and such a decrease will be most noticeable from 2060 to 2099. In addition, the annual CO2 sink value and the annual CH4 source value of the peatlands will decrease significantly in the western areas of the raised bog region, and such changes will be greater in the pristine fens than in pristine bogs. A large fraction of the fens in the raised-bog region and the southwestern part of the aapa-mire region has the potential to shift from CO2 sinks into weak CO2 sources (<20gCm−2a−1) by the end of the 21st century. The transition of bogs from centurial CO2 sinks to sources is most notable near coastal areas. These bogs would function as CO2 sources at an average rate of over 40gCm−2a−1 for the 21st century under the changing climate scenario.",

One dimension classifies how the decision taking is organized, centralized or decentralized. The other dimension classifies how the scheduling problem is approached, relying on human insights or on optimization algorithms. On the bases of the Iron Triangle of Project Management a comparison analysis of the multi-project approaches methods has been here performed. The outcome reveals that the majority of the approaches sets scope as a constraint and minimize lead-time by optimizing the resource allocation with centralized heuristic algorithms. An exception is the relatively new approach Scrum-of-Scrums, which is a people oriented, decentralized decision-taking approach. Scope optimization is the primary objective of Scrum. Comparing the performance of the different approaches is an interesting field for further study, especially the comparison of automated decisions taking with human decision taking.",

The approach provides a simplified dynamic vulnerability model developed within a conceptual model adopted – but very rarely made operational – by many international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, the European Union. We propose a procedure in which disciplinary experts and local actors interact for the identification of the most relevant issues with reference to a specific vulnerability problem. Local actors (e.g. representatives of public administrations, business, NGOs) identify the most relevant issues related to the various dimensions of vulnerability, to be considered as input variables to contextualise the generalised model in the study case. Quantitative indicators are provided by disciplinary experts to describe past and future trends of variables, and their trajectories are combined to explore possible future vulnerability trends and scenarios. A non additive aggregation operator is proposed to allow experts and actors to pro vide their preferences through ad hoc questionnaires, thus overcoming the oversimplifications of most of the current vulnerability indices, which are usually either additive (fully compensatory) or multiplicative (non compensatory), and providing transparent and robust management of subjectivity and analysis of the deriving variability and uncertainty in model outputs. Input data for the demonstration of the model derive from the European Project Brahmatwinn, with reference to the Assam State in India.",

We use the notion of ‘holism’ to explore the difficulties in comprehending the span of change in contemporary business, presenting ‘holistic risk’ as a vital but aspirational construct transcending boundaries, functions and disciplines. Specifically we address implications for teaching and learning holistic risk, for related program goals and curriculum design, and for embedding critical analytical skills into curriculum, arguing that students engage with holistic risk throughout the entire spectrum of problem-solving. Thus, educators must grapple with helping students in this effort. In support, we offer examples of our own practice in curriculum design and pedagogy. We conclude that the concept of holism might provoke a better understanding between educators and industry stakeholders concerning knowledge and skills to deal with risks associated with dynamic shifts in business environments. Such collaboration could help students operate more confidently in fluid, unpredictable business settings.",

The purpose of this paper is to understand the underlying dynamics of these police reforms. Following an overview of concepts drawn from the public policy literature regarding policy change, the paper describes in detail the structural changes to policing that have occurred in both countries. These structural changes relate not just to the spatial re-organization of policing but also to the structure of police governance and accountability. The focus then shifts to disentangling key aspects of the decision-making processes which led to the reforms drawing on Kingdon's analysis of policy change and policy formation. The paper concludes with a broader discussion of the similarities and differences in police reform in the two countries, highlighting important issues regarding the significance of political context, debates around localism and policing, and narratives regarding a normative vision of the police role.",

abstract = "Environmental impacts by both natural events and man-made interventions are a fact of life; and developing the capacity to minimise these impacts and their harmful consequences for biological resources, ecosystems and human health is a daunting task for environmental legislators and regulators. A major challenge in impact and risk assessment, as part of integrated environmental management (IEM), is to link harmful effects of pollution (including toxic chemicals) in individual sentinel animals to their ecological consequences. This obstacle has resulted in a knowledge-gap for those seeking to develop effective policies for sustainable use of resources and environmental protection. Part of the solution to this problem may lie with the use of diagnostic clinical-type laboratory-based ecotoxicological tests or biomarkers, utilising sentinel animals as integrators of pollution, coupled with direct immunochemical tests for contaminants. These rapid and cost-effective ecotoxicological tools can provide information on the health status of individuals and populations based on relatively small samples of individuals. In the context of ecosystem status or health of the environment, biomarkers are also being used to link processes of molecular and cellular damage through to higher levels (i.e., prognostic capability), where they can result in pathology with reduced physiological performance and reproductive success. Complex issues are involved in evaluating environmental risk, such as the effects of the physico-chemical environment on the speciation and uptake of pollutant chemicals and inherent inter-individual and inter-species differences in vulnerability to toxicity; and the toxicity of complex mixtures. Effectively linking the impact of pollutants through the various hierarchical levels of biological organisation to ecosystem and human health requires a pragmatic integrated approach based on existing information that either links or correlates processes of pollutant uptake, detoxication and pathology with each other and higher level effects. It is further proposed here that this process will be facilitated by pursuing a holistic or whole systems approach with the development of computational simulation models of cells, organs and animals in tandem with empirical data (i.e., the middle-out approach). In conclusion, an effective integrated environmental management strategy to secure resource sustainability requires an integrated capability for risk assessment and prediction. Furthermore, if such a strategy is to influence and help in the formulation of environmental policy decisions, then it is crucial to demonstrate scientific robustness of predictions concerning the long-term consequences of pollution to politicians, industrialists and environmental managers; and also increase stakeholder awareness of environmental problems.",

In this paper, we describe the development of a virtual environment for the exploration and analysis of different configurations of policy measures in order to build policy packages. By developing systematic approaches it is possible to examine more alternatives at a greater depth, decrease the time required for the overall analysis, provide real-time assessment and feedback on the effect of changes in the configurations, and ultimately form more effective policies.

Many works on the organisational dimension in safety are now available and some recent researches have attempted to integrate the three dimensions, sometimes in a quantitative manner. This paper is an attempt to make things clearer around the organisational issues for the purpose of enhancing current safety auditing but also for discussing the issue of integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches with various dimensions. This paper goes through a presentation of complexity and the work of some researchers who have conceptually defined complexity. This provides an interesting framework compared to the scientific deterministic and positivist one (generally implied in technical approaches), when it comes to thinking of complex systems, which organisations and major accidents phenomena are. This paper tries to identify some of the most influential organisation theories within the human and social sciences and attempts to classify some of the existing organisational researches in major hazard prevention and accident investigation using these theories. With an experience in technical risk assessment, safety auditing and accident investigation, the author discusses the difficulty of introducing the complex nature of organisations into integrated methodologies (implying a link between technical installations and organisations), and discusses the perspective of introducing it into current safety auditing practices. The research strategy of this work is therefore an interdisciplinary one, using insights from safety engineering, safety auditing practices and human and social sciences. This kind of research implies an exploration and understanding of the rationales in these different domains. It is aimed at creating, as far as possible, articulation between them for practical purposes. The nature of this paper is therefore in some parts theoretical and conceptual, but intends to frame some of the issues for improving auditing techniques and integrated methodologies. Current empirical researches are being carried out to create the methodologies required for supporting auditing improvements.",

Disparities in colorectal cancer outcomes and screening rates exist between rural and urban populations as well as indigenous and non-indigenous patients. While screening access is a strategic health priority, various health system complexities impede screening access. Understanding the health system complexities is a necessary first step for system transformation to enable increased screening access to improve cancer outcomes.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews with health care providers (N=29) involved in colorectal cancer screening were performed from September to December 2015. A framework integrating Collaborative Information Behaviour (CIB) and Continuity of Care (COC) was designed to conceptualize and understand health system complexity within colorectal cancer screening in order to inform screening access solutions.
Results
Eighteen different models of colorectal screening access were identified after which access problems were identified and characterized as high or low complexity. We also identified a set of contextual factors that influence complexity.
Conclusions
Colorectal cancer screening in remote regions is a complex health systems problem. It is important to distinguish high and low complexity issues as they require different approaches to solving the issues. Contextual factors such as social determinants of health and locum based practice must also be considered. Ultimately, solutions for colorectal cancer screening access in sociocultural diverse remote regions will require a balance between high and low system complexity.",

Global literature suggests that resilience-based interventions may yield improvements in psychosocial well-being for vulnerable children, but limited data are available regarding the efficacy of such interventions among children affected by parental HIV/AIDS.
Objective
To evaluate initial efficacy of a multi-level resilience-based intervention among children affected by parental HIV/AIDS in China in improving children's psychosocial well-being and resilience-related outcomes.
Method
Seven hundred-ninety children, 6–17 years of age, were recruited from rural China. Children were either AIDS orphans or were living with one or two parents infected with HIV/AIDS. Children and primary caregivers were randomly assigned to participate in a 4-arm trial to evaluate the Child-Caregiver-Advocacy Resilience (ChildCARE) intervention. This resilience-based psychosocial intervention provides programming at three levels (child, caregiver, community). Survey data were collected at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months in order to examine efficacy of the child-only and child + caregiver arms in improving children's psychological resilience.

Intervention groups displayed improvements in several resilience-related outcomes at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, including self-reported coping, hopefulness, emotional regulation, and self-control. The child-only intervention arm showed some fading of intervention effects by 12-months.
Conclusion
Preliminary findings suggest that the ChildCARE intervention is efficacious in promoting psychosocial well-being of children affected by parental HIV/AIDS in rural China. Targeting both children and caregivers for psychosocial intervention may be effective in improving children's resilience. Additional evaluation and modifications, including the inclusion of booster sessions, should be considered to further strengthen the program.",

abstract = "Optimal scheduling of generating resources plays a significant role as a decision-making tool for power system operators in the liberalized and real-time electricity spot markets. The real-time scheduling of generating units will become a very complex task with respect to the instantaneous fluctuation of the load demand due to several demand response scenarios in the smart grid context. In this study, a hybrid mathematical method for the online scheduling of units based on the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and the third version of cultural algorithm (CA3) has been presented, where the CA3 has been specifically employed to tune the adjusting parameters of LSSVM. For the training purpose of the proposed method, the optimal scheduling of the daily load curve for four different test systems and various physical and environmental constraints of generating units have been prepared by using a modified mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to deal with non-convex behaviors of the test systems. A mean squared error (MSE) objective function has been used to reduce the prediction errors during the training process to enhance the precision and reliability of the results. A radial basis function (RBF) and the proposed LSSVM-CA3 were used to check the convergence process. A high accuracy of generator schedule predictions are demonstrated by comparing the results of the proposed method with those of artificial neural networks. From the results, it can be inferred that the method is highly compatible for real-time dispatching of generation resources in deregulated electricity markets.",

abstract = "Organizational buyers struggle with the effective management of business-to-business (B2B) services, yet little research has examined specifically how the procurement process impacts the supplier’s level of delivered service quality. Based on a sample of 216 buyers of services, this study uses structural equation modeling to examine the relationships between service quality and its determinants. The results suggest that the sufficiency of the requirement definition and communication between the buyer and supplier are associated with B2B service quality, but that monitoring the supplier is not. Additionally, the internal customer’s level of commitment to the procurement and the sufficiency of the allotted procurement lead time affect how sufficiently the buyer defines the requirement for the supplier. The internal customer’s commitment also affects the amount of monitoring of and communication with the supplier. The study’s findings have implications for integrating unified service theory with service-dominant logic; since service quality increases service value, these findings add fidelity to S-D Logic by unveiling specifically how to co-create value with the supplier. Two novel constructs are introduced to supply chain management discourse—sufficiency of the requirement definition and sufficiency of procurement lead time. Furthermore, a new measure of B2B service quality is offered. From these results, implications for practice and theory are drawn. The study concludes with a discussion of limitations and promising directions for future research.",

abstract = "Industrial synergies are collaborative partnerships between companies resulting in the sharing of resources or the exchange of material or energy by-products, and leading to cleaner production processes and more efficient use of resources. They generally have both economic and environmental benefits. The creation of such innovative partnerships within a territory leads to the development of an industrial symbiosis (IS), which is a dynamic network of interconnected industrial actors. IS can develop in different manners, with different levels of planning and serendipity, in which the diffusion of trust and knowledge are generally thought to play a key role. This paper proposes and evaluates a simple agent-based model of self-organized IS development capable of simulating and predicting the impacts of social factors (i.e., social structure and dynamics, trust, knowledge diffusion) on the creation of industrial synergies and the emergence of IS. This model was tested using NetLogo. Its consistency with the original design objectives was validated with a sensitivity analysis that considered several factors. Next, experiments were designed and carried out in order to study the influence of the social structure (i.e., types of social network) and dynamics (i.e., creation of new social contacts between plants). Results revealed that both factors have an influence on synergy creation, and IS development is a function of both social dynamics and structure. However, more multidisciplinary analysis is required to better understand the limits of this model, to validate its assumptions, as well as to improve it.",

To cope with this overarching issue, some technological solutions such as Smart Grids, Internet of Things or Demand response are proposed. However, the majority of them overlooks the role of human beings in the equation. Moreover, the very nascent body of research combining human and machine intelligence proposes methods, frameworks, and guidelines which vary depending on the application scenario complicating the selection of gold-standards to ensure seamless cooperation between smart devices and people. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide a set of design-hypotheses to devise augmented objects that ally with their users to reduce energy consumption. We expect designers, engineers, makers or even hobbyists in the intersection between technology-enablers (through IoT) and behavioural scientists to benefit from them. To this aim, we describe the results of a long-term study in office-based workplaces, where participants were randomly assigned to different experimental conditions (persuasion, dashboard, and automation) to increase their energy-efficient behaviour. Grounded Theory analysis was applied over qualitative data collected during focus group sessions obtaining five themes around a central category. The resulting themes were linked to design-hypotheses for IoT devices which were then tested through the implementation of a new IoT object also conceived for the workplace.",

We examine network governance emergence in four case studies from the Lesser Antilles: Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. We find that governance is currently in transition towards a more networked mode within all the cases. Our results suggest that participation in collaborative projects has played an important role in initiating transitions. Additionally, multilateral agreements, boundary-spanning organizations, and experience with extreme events provide enabling conditions for network governance. Successfully navigating the ongoing transitions towards improved network governance will require (1) facilitating the leadership of central actors and core teams in steering towards network governance and (2) finding ways to appropriately engage the latent capacity of communities and non-state actors in governance networks.",

This study focused on analyzing the main environmental problems for Gorganroud watershed health using the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. The trend of each DPSIR index was also computed using 18 quantitative indicators during the years 2004–2018. Prioritization of the watershed problems using the Friedman test ranked loss of groundwater resources, flood potential, and soil erosion rate as the most important challenges of the watershed. The results showed that except for the S index, all the other have an ascending trend during the study period. The trend slopes of D, P, S, I, and R indices were equal to 0.08, 0.05, -0.05, 0.02, and 0.04, respectively. This means the health of Gorganroud watershed becomes worse over time due to the socioeconomic activities and related pressures. Although some practical measures have been implemented as responses to balance other indices of DPSIR, however, they are neither sufficient nor integrated. The response of increasing water use efficiency has resulted in a rebound effect, causing higher consumption of water resources (Jevons Paradox). While only an integrated approach would guarantee the long-term health of watersheds, fragmented watershed governance structure has made serious challenges for the Integrated Watershed Management approach in the study area.",

These studies move the discussion on the social dynamics of conservation forward, however, they do not offer insight into the underlying mechanisms that shape household-level outcomes such as income and wealth. By focusing on protected areas as centers of uncertainty, upheaval, and disturbance, this study examines the character and incidence of livelihood diversification within communities near Tarangire National Park in northern Tanzania compared to communities far from the park. Livelihood diversification is well understood as a coping and/or risk mitigation strategy pursued in response to various types of shocks, and uncertainty more generally. This study draws on mixed methodologies to construct multivariate statistical models to estimate the effect of proximity to the park on measures of livelihood diversification. The results indicate that proximity to park is strongly correlated with livelihood diversification, suggesting that households near the park are adapting to opportunities and constraints and may be seeking to reduce variance in income and wealth in response to disturbances and uncertainty associated with the park.",

Consequently, this demands that the power generation should consider the optimal management of thermal sources that are aimed at minimizing the emission of gasses in the generation mix. The production volume of multi-pollutant gasses (SO2, NOx, and CO2) can be reduced through a combined environmental economic dispatch (CEED) approach. This study has proposed a hybrid algorithm based on a novel combination of a modified genetic algorithm and an improved version of particle swarm optimization abbreviated as MGAIPSO to solve CEED problem. The study utilizes three robust operators to enhance the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm. In GA, a uniformly weighted arithmetic crossover and a normally distributed mutation operator have been implemented to produce elite off-springs in each iteration and diversify the solutions in the search space. In the case of PSO, a non-linear time-varying double-weighted (NLTVDW) technique is developed to obtain a substantial balance between exploration and exploitation. To further enhance the exploitation ability of the MGAIPSO, this study has implemented two movements correctional methods to continuously monitor and amend the position and velocity of the particles. Several numerical case studies ranging from small to large-scale are carried out to validate the practicality of the proposed algorithm.",

abstract = "Cloud service composition builds new value-added services by combining existing single services. However, because of the exuberant growth of cloud services and the varying quality of service (QoS), discovering required services and creating a service composition with certain quality guarantees becomes a significant technical issue and attracts much concern. Computational intelligence techniques are considered to be effective in solving such problems, and researchers have made substantial efforts in this area. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any systematic research about this issue with a particular focus on computing intelligence. Thus, the current study aims to create a panoramic view of QoS-aware cloud service composition from the perspective of computational intelligence. The objectives of this paper are to (1) investigate the relevant studies on this field; (2) make a comprehensive examination of the literature from different aspects: active researchers, research motivations, QoS parameters, algorithms, datasets, optimization strategies and could layers; (3) identify the areas which need further research. For this, a search protocol has been well defined, and 105 articles from 2009 to 2018 were selected. This study classified these articles into three groups, including non-heuristic, heuristic and meta-heuristic, and then examined the research works from several aspects. The results indicate that reducing response time is the most important motivation for researchers, and meta-heuristic algorithms, especially genetic algorithms, are the most widely used computational intelligence techniques. Besides, the most widely used QoS attributes and datasets are also revealed. Additionally, the study points out there are still some research challenges in this area, such as QoS evaluation in a dynamic environment and inter-service correlations. In general, this study classified and compared the existing computational intelligence techniques; analyzed the research status and identified future research directions. It can provide a basis for both researchers and practitioners who are interested in this area. More significantly, in the field of expert and intelligent systems, this study can assist in the design and development of expert and intelligent systems in enterprises, it can efficiently assist enterprises in business decisions and risk reduction.",

The main objectives of the study include measurement of the respective resilience of the ecological, social and agricultural systems of the SEPLS by using relevant indicators. The method of the study consists of three parts: (i) conceptualization of the resilience of the SEPLS of Lefke Region to address the key systems (ecosystem, agricultural and social), their hierarchical structures, components and interrelations; (ii) development of a set of suitable resilience assessment indicators for these systems; (iii) for the development of resilience assessment indicators a participatory approach was designated to collect the relevant data. Accordingly, a multiple-choice questionnaire – consisting of 5 choices – was prepared and relevant data were collected from December 2015 to March 2016 in 12 villages through personal interviews with 106 respondents. The respondents have expressed their preferences by selecting the most suitable choice in 5 which were ordered from the lowest to the highest degree of resilience (1–5 point scale). The results of the evaluation revealed that the average values (importance) of the ecological, agricultural and social resilience are respectively 2,87 (low), 3,44 (moderate) and 2,53 (low) out of maximum 5-points. The overall resilience of the SEPLS was estimated to be low with a 2,94 magnitude. Finally, some conclusions (e.g. integrated landscape management) for strengthening the resilience of the SEPLS in Lefke Region in terms of biodiversity conservation, agricultural production and sustainable livelihood development were drawn based on the major findings of the study. It is expected that the findings and conclusions of this study can draw attention of policy makers and natural resource managers on building and strengthening the resilience of the SEPLS of Lefke Region in terms of biodiversity conservation, sustainable agricultural production and livelihood development.",

abstract = "In today's competitive world, service providers need to be customer-focused and proactive in their marketing strategies to create consumer awareness of their services. Cloud computing provides an open and ubiquitous computing feature in which a large random number of consumers can interact with providers and request services. In such an environment, there is a need for intelligent and efficient methods that increase confidence in the successful achievement of business requirements. One such method is the Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is comprised of service objectives, business terms, service relations, obligations and the possible action to be taken in the case of SLA violation. Most of the emphasis in the literature has, until now, been on the formation of meaningful SLAs by service consumers, through which their requirements will be met. However, in an increasingly competitive market based on the cloud environment, service providers too need a framework that will form a viable SLA, predict possible SLA violations before they occur, and generate early warning alarms that flag a potential lack of resources. This is because when a provider and a consumer commit to an SLA, the service provider is bound to reserve the agreed amount of resources for the entire period of that agreement – whether the consumer uses them or not. It is therefore very important for cloud providers to accurately predict the likely resource usage for a particular consumer and to formulate an appropriate SLA before finalizing an agreement. This problem is more important for a small to medium cloud service provider which has limited resources that must be utilized in the best possible way to generate maximum revenue. A viable SLA in cloud computing is one that intelligently helps the service provider to determine the amount of resources to offer to a requesting consumer, and there are number of studies on SLA management in the literature. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, it presents a comprehensive overview of existing state-of-the-art SLA management approaches in cloud computing, and their features and shortcomings in creating viable SLAs from the service provider's viewpoint. From a thorough analysis, we observe that the lack of a viable SLA management framework renders a service provider unable to make wise decisions in forming an SLA, which could lead to service violations and violation penalties. To fill this gap, our second contribution is the proposal of the Optimized Personalized Viable SLA (OPV-SLA) framework which assists a service provider to form a viable SLA and start managing SLA violation before an SLA is formed and executed. The framework also assists a service provider to make an optimal decision in service formation and allocate the appropriate amount of marginal resources. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in forming viable SLAs through experiments. From the evaluative results, we observe that our framework helps a service provider to form viable SLAs and later to manage them to effectively minimize possible service violation and penalties.",

This paper wants to bring up also the complexity theory matter in order for us to be able to build a connection between innovation and complex adaptive social systems. The critical question is whether and how social networks can help facilitate innovations to bridge the seemingly insurmountable chasms that separate local solutions from broad system transformation; that is, how they help innovations to “cross scales”. Using a complexity lens to understand the meta challenges confronting the world, and applying a social innovation framework to illuminate how local novelty spreads so as to have broad system impacts, this paper proposes that institutional entrepreneurship enhances the understanding of agency that is active within networks. The Public sector adopts strategies for dealing with complexity, therefore, focuses on outcomes (rather than inputs and outputs) that are demonstrable and measurable (even if only qualitatively), collaboration and co-ordination (across sectors, fields, organizational boundaries etc.), decentralization and self-organization (by increasing decision making powers of local communities), building adaptive capacity (in order to support decentralization and self-organization and build resilience).",

In this study, we propose a metaphoric concept called a flowable service. It is defined as a logical stream that organizes and provides circumjacent services in such a way that they are perceived by individuals to be naturally embedded in their surrounding environments. We present our view on how some of these problems, such as the flexibility, portability and interoperability of services, can be solved using flowable services in order to provide a seamless integration of diverse services in the most intuitive “flowable” way possible, thus achieving maximum satisfaction for both service providers and consumers while decreasing the delivery cost of the services. Recognizing the importance of the awareness of each individual’s context for a smooth and accurate provision of services, we further propose a human-centric framework for context-aware flowable services, which harnesses the users’ contexts to enable a pro-active support of human activities in a flexible and natural way. Owing to context-awareness, this framework can find and integrate circumjacent services that are considered needed by each individual and can create an ambient service environment that is tailored to his/her specific needs, proclivities and characteristics.",

These systems may be profoundly influenced by human decisions at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and the limitations of traditional process-level ecosystems modeling approaches for representing the richness of factors shaping landscape dynamics in these coupled systems has resulted in the need for new analysis approaches. New tools in the areas of spatial data management and analysis, multicriteria decision-making, individual-based modeling, and complexity science have all begun to impact how we approach modeling these systems. The term “biocomplexity” has emerged as a descriptor of the rich patterns of interactions and behaviors in human and natural systems, and the challenges of analyzing biocomplex behavior is resulting in a convergence of approaches leading to new ways of understanding these systems. Important questions related to system vulnerability and resilience, adaptation, feedback processing, cycling, non-linearities and other complex behaviors are being addressed using models employing new representational approaches to analysis. The complexity inherent in these systems challenges the modeling community to provide tools that capture sufficiently the richness of human and ecosystem processes and interactions in ways that are computationally tractable and understandable. We examine one such tool, EvoLand, which uses an actor-based approach to conduct alternative futures analyses in the Willamette Basin, Oregon.",

This is a relevant question, because firms seek stability in their operations, and therefore managers need to know how the structure of their supply chains affects the occurrence of disruptions. The present study addresses this issue with a specific focus on upstream supply chain (supply-side) disruptions. Drawing on the literature on supply chain complexity, we devise and test a model that predicts the frequency of supply chain disruptions based on a multi-dimensional conceptualization of upstream supply chain complexity. Not only do the empirical findings suggest that all of the three investigated complexity drivers – horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity – increase the frequency of disruptions, but also that they interact and amplify each other's effects in a synergistic fashion.",

A theoretical model of coordination in the agile software development context is presented based on empirical data from three cases of co-located agile software development. Many practices in these projects act as coordination mechanisms, which together form a coordination strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has three components: synchronisation, structure, and boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical model of coordination in agile software development projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy increases coordination effectiveness. This model has application for practitioners who want to select appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure they achieve coordination coverage in their project. For the field of information systems development, this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination and coordination effectiveness in the context of agile software development.",

abstract = "Agricultural land system exists in the intersection of coupled human and natural systems. The consequences of agricultural land use change greatly disturb terrestrial ecosystem services, global carbon cycling, and global food security. As result, so many prior studies took land use change as an essential component of global change to cause impacts on human society. However, agricultural landscapes are complex outcomes integrated by human activities and natural processes, its dynamics not only represent an element of global environment change, but also reflect the human dimension adaptation to global change, which is easily ignored. Consequently, current analysis and modeling are unable to explain agricultural land use change and its drivers in a proper way. Farmer households are the basic decision-making units in agricultural land systems, whose willingness and ability affect their land use actions, and ultimately determine the landscape. Moreover, such decision-making processes are frequently altered when adapting to the changed human and natural environment. Taking the advantage of agent-based modeling (ABM) that simulates pattern-process from bottoms to up in complexity systems, the paper presents an agent-based framework aims to examine how farmer households adapt to the consequences of global change and how they alter their land use actions. With this new perspective, we are able to understand the complexity of the coupled human and natural agricultural land systems more systematically, and to model the dynamics of agricultural landscape more reasonably.",

The results show that adaptive marketing capabilities have the greatest impact on market performance. In addition, while environmental turbulence obliterates the contribution of static marketing capabilities (turning the effect negative), it actually strengthens the relationship between adaptive marketing capabilities and firm performance. Finally, dynamic marketing capabilities have a similar impact under low and high environmental turbulence, suggesting the instability in today's marketplace even within relatively “stable” markets. Together, the insights from this research underscore the importance of differentiating among the three types of marketing capabilities and building a firm's capabilities portfolio depending on firm and market conditions.",

This study challenges this core tenet by adopting a neo-configurational perspective, exploring how different combinations of factors (called “configurations”) affect outcomes. Another limitation of extant studies on the ‘purchasing practice–performance link’ is the narrow focus on practices; more recent behavioral supply management research finds the behavior of managers to be critically influenced by cognitive maps—the lenses through which managers perceive, simplify, and interpret the world. Focusing on supplier quality as a core aspect of the broader ‘purchasing practice–performance link’, this study explores how configurations of different supplier quality management (SQM) practices and SQM-related cognitive maps help firms to manage supplier quality. It uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify SQM configurations and a cognitive-linguistic approach for the computerized text analysis of purchasing managers’ cognitive maps in the context of Western companies sourcing from Chinese suppliers. The configurational fsQCA analysis identifies four different configurations associated with overcoming barriers to SQM in emerging markets. SQM-related cognitive maps prove to be a critical component in these four configurations.",

A synthetic data assimilation experiment based on the widely used tilted V-catchment problem showed that the computational overhead for the application of the data assimilation platform in a cloud computing environment is minimal, which makes it well-suited for practical water management problems. Advantages of the cloud-based implementation comprise the independence from computational infrastructure and the straightforward integration of cloud-based observation databases with the modelling and data assimilation platform.",

Based on the evaluation framework, which includes natural resources, the natural environment and the social economy, the results indicate that an ecosystem in a mountainous area is more vulnerable than it is in a plain. Land desertification will worsen from 2014 to 2099 under the RCP4.5 scenarios and improve slightly under the RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios, while the suitable land for agriculture increased slightly under the three scenarios. In addition, a regional sensitivity analysis of vulnerability to climate change shows that the improving region and the worsening region will occupy 1.30% and 74.51%, respectively. In view of this, the socio-ecological system will undergo a worsening trend as a whole. Finally, we simplified how to solve the problem of a socio-ecological system in the future.

abstract = "This paper examines the main factors that lie behind the expansion of commercial activities in European airports. It maintains that airport authorities have been forced to react to a variety of external pressures over which they have no control. This has led to a number of airports reassessing their strategic priorities in favour of a more commercially orientated approach. The paper highlights how this re-focusing has manifested itself in terms of the design, layout and allocation of commercial space within an airport. In addition it examines how this change has increased the role and prominence of commercial management.",

abstract = "Decision-making and action selection are mental activities for shaping and organizing human behavior in the ever-changing environment. There are, however, important differences between decision-making and action selection. According to “Two Minds” (Evans and Frankish, 2009, Kahneman, 2003, Kahneman, 2011) – a version of dual processing theory – human behavior can be viewed as the integration of output of System 1, i.e., unconscious automatic processes, and System 2, i.e., conscious deliberate processes. System 1 activates a sequence of automatic actions. System 2 monitors System 1’s performance according to the plan it has created and, at the same time, it activates future possible courses of actions. Decision-making narrowly refers to System 2’s slow functions for planning for the future and related deliberate activities, e.g., monitoring, for future planning. On the other hand, action selection refers to integrated activities including not only System 1’s fast activities but also System 2’s slow activities, not separately but integrally. This paper further discusses the difference between decision-making and action selection on the basis of the architecture model the authors have developed for simulating human beings’ in situ action selection, Model Human Processor with Realtime Constraints (MHP/RT) (Kitajima & Toyota, 2012b). MHP/RT’s simulation of human behavior along the time dimension shows when the processes of decision-making and action selection would be initiated and how they are carried out.",

abstract = "Resilience thinking has many parallels in the study of geomorphology. Similarities and intersections exist between the scientific discipline of geomorphology and the scientific concept of resilience. Many of the core themes fundamental to geomorphology are closely related to the key themes of resilience. Applications of resilience thinking in the study of natural and human systems have expanded, based on the fundamental premise that ecosystems, economies, and societies must be managed as linked social-ecological systems. Despite geomorphology and resilience sharing core themes, appreciation is limited of the history and development of geomorphology as a field of scientific endeavor by many in the field of resilience, as well as a limited awareness of the foundations of the former in the more recent emergence of resilience. This potentially limits applications of resilience concepts to the study of geomorphology. In this manuscript we provide a collective examination of geomorphology and resilience as a means to conceptually advance both areas of study, as well as to further cement the relevance and importance of not only understanding the complexities of geomorphic systems in an emerging world of interdisciplinary challenges but also the importance of viewing humans as an intrinsic component of geomorphic systems rather than just an external driver. The application of the concepts of hierarchy and scale, fundamental tenets of the study of geomorphic systems, provide a means to overcome contemporary scale-limited approaches within resilience studies. Resilience offers a framework for geomorphology to expand its application into the broader social-ecological domain.",

abstract = "Quality improvement (QI) is becoming a central part of the work of clinicians throughout healthcare. Continuous quality improvement (CQI), Lean Management Systems (LMS) and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) are management philosophies as well as management methods. They offer an approach, a set of tools, and a way of thinking about how to more effectively assess and study clinical flow, including addressing variation in clinical process and operations. We define CQI as the daily use of QI methods as a regular part of practice engaging all practice staff, constantly measuring structure, processes, outcomes against effective practices (benchmarking), moving from one QI project to the next, pursuing the goal of “The right care for every child every time”. It is based on clear scientific principles, a valid way of measuring change and has theories of reliability and human factors that underpin the interventions. Significant variations in quality of care provided to pediatric patients leading to substandard care have been well documented. For example, in antibiotic prescribing for community acquired pneumonia; pediatric secondhand smoke reduction; screening for diabetes in cystic fibrosis program; and, in depression screening in Type 1 Diabetes. Despite this, not enough pediatric practices are performing continuous quality improvement (CQI) as part of their daily activities. All health care professionals caring for children should consider incorporating quality measurement into their practice. However, we need to focus on what is the right approach to take and the right questions to ask and address the challenges of aggregating scientifically imperfect tests of change. Increasingly, colleagues, patients, payers and certifying agencies expect such measurement to achieve the Triple Aim of better health, better care and lower cost. In addition, new payment models increasingly pay providers for demonstrated value rather than volume, and they expect participation in continuous improvement. Quality Improvement (QI) is a critical component of the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Part 4. This requires pediatricians to participate in a meaningful manner in two data-driven QI projects every five years. Pediatricians can select quality measures to evaluate whether patient outcomes and experience improve, and if not, identify and overcome barriers. In this paper we discuss performance improvement using CQI and related methods, suggest approaches to help pediatric cardiologists to ask the right questions when seeking to drive improvement, and consider the implications of measurement theory and complexity science for QI and CQI.",

We present a sectoral diffusion analysis framework, which we apply to identify and examine developments in technical, economic, institutional, cultural and ecological domains that all contributed to an emergent and thorough CHP diffusion in the Dutch greenhouse sector. Five identified key drivers behind the CHP diffusion are the opening of the energy market in 2002, the high spark spread during the transition period, the compatibility of output of a CHP unit with greenhouse demand, the flexibility provided by heat buffers, and the cooperative and competitive greenhouse sector culture. We conclude that policies to stimulate or steer technology diffusion will benefit from an in-depth analysis of domain interactions and company decision-making processes. Such an in-depth analysis makes for well informed and targeted policies that are better able to steer an industrial sector effectively and in a socially desired direction.",

abstract = "In the construction industry, subcontracting is a very common practice. Nowadays, most of the general contractors tend to sublet the large portions of construction works to subcontractors and they only act as construction management agencies. In other words, while subcontractors carry out the actual production work, general contractors organize and coordinate the subcontractors and control their works in terms of time, cost and quality. In the construction industry, since the general contractors are responsible to the owners for the works carried out by the subcontractors, the general contractors should select the most appropriate subcontractors for the work packages that constitute the entire project. In the literature, there are a great number of studies that focus on subcontractor selection practices in the construction industry. These studies can mainly be categorized into two groups, which are; 1) the studies that aim to identify the subcontractor selection criteria and their importance levels, and 2) the studies that aim to propose tools, techniques and/or methodologies for subcontractor selection. The common point of the studies in the second category is that they all focus on selecting the most appropriate subcontractor for one work package in the project. For instance, if the case is the airport construction project, the construction of car park may be one work package. In this study, selection of subcontractors for the all work packages in a construction project is made using genetic algorithm technique considering time, cost and quality performances. A real-life construction project is selected as a case study and the actual data regarding alternative subcontractors are collected. The subcontractors for all work packages were selected successfully using the genetic algorithm technique.",

Cultural theory argues that “how” we govern and manage health services depends on what we think about the nature of government organizations and the legitimacy of their scope of action. The values that are implied by universal health coverage underlie choices about “how” health systems are governed and their organizations are managed. We draw two main conclusions. First, the translation of principles and goals into practice requires exceptional efforts to design adequate decision-making arrangements (the essence of governance) and management practices. Management and governance, or “how” policies are decided and conducted, are not secondary to the selection of the best policy solutions (the “what”). Second, governance and management solutions are not independent of the values that they are expected to serve. Instead, they should be designed to be consonant with these values. Cultural theory suggests—and experience supports—the idea that “group identity” is favorable for shaping different forms of social life and public administrations. This approach should thus be a starting point for those who strive to obtain universal health coverage.",

A better understanding of the correlation would help save both water and energy, for example, through technological innovations, management and policies. Recently, there is an increasing need for a higher spatiotemporal resolution in the analysis and modelling of water-energy demand, as the results would be more useful for policy analysis and infrastructure planning in both water and energy systems. In response, this paper developed an agent-based spatiotemporal integrated approach to simulate the water-energy consumption of each household or person agent in second throughout a whole day, considering the influences of out-of-home activities (e.g., work and shopping) on in-home activities (e.g., bathing, cooking and cleaning). The integrated approach was tested in the capital of China, Beijing. The temporal results suggested that the 24-hour distributions of water and related energy consumptions were quite similar, and the water-energy consumptions were highly correlated (with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89); The spatial results suggested that people living in the central districts and the central areas of the outer districts tended to consume more water and related energy, and also the water-energy correlation varies across space. Such spatially and temporally explicit results are expected to be useful for policy making (e.g., time-of-use tariffs) and infrastructure planning and optimization in both water and energy sectors.",

Articles in this issue highlight the relevance of transdisciplinary research in perinatology and calls for increased efforts to translate research into public policy and to integrate interventions into existing primary care delivery systems. Given the complexity and multi-causality of many of the remaining challenges in newborn health, and the effects that social and economic factors have over many newborn conditions, it has further been proposed that integrated, multi-sector public policies are also required. In this article, we discuss the application of systems science methods to advance transdisciplinary research and public policy-making in perinatology. Such approaches to research and public policy have been used to address various global challenges but have rarely been implemented in developing country settings. We propose that they hold great promise to improve not only our understanding of complex perinatology problems but can also help translate research-based insights into effective, multi-pronged solutions that deliver positive, intended effects. Examples of successful transdisciplinary science exist, but successes and failures are context specific, and there are no universal blueprints or formulae to reproduce what works in a specific context into different social system settings. Group model building is a tool, based in the field of System Dynamics, that we have used to facilitate transdisciplinary research and, to a lesser extent, policy formulation in a systematic and replicable way. In this article, we describe how group model building can be used and argue for scaling its use to further the translation of empirical evidence and insights into policy and action that increase maternal and neonatal survival and well-being.",

This study asks: What could the dominant innovation models look like in the future, and, in contrast, what could alternative ones look like? And how conducive are those different models to mitigating sustainability challenges and improving quality of life? To make the exploration tangible, this study focuses on nanotechnology innovation in an urban region (Phoenix, Arizona). The study uses a mixed methods approach, linking intuitive and analytical scenario construction, to allow for creativity while ensuring analytical rigor. Findings suggest four different models of nanotechnology innovation and governance affect sustainability challenges quite differently. Market-oriented and closed collaboration amplify the lack of social cohesion, result in low-wage service sector jobs, and intensify resource extraction rates. Alternatively, social entrepreneurship and open-source innovation are more conducive to addressing sustainability challenges and improving quality of life, in particular in urban areas. The study concludes that the way a society innovates and governs its emerging technologies is decisive for the way those technologies work in favor of, or against comprehensive public interests.",

abstract = "Agricultural education, research, and extension can contribute substantially to reducing rural poverty in the developing world. However, evidence suggests that their contributions are falling short in Sub-Saharan Africa. The entry of new actors, technologies, and market forces, when combined with new economic and demographic pressures, suggests the need for more innovative and less linear approaches to promoting a technological transformation of smallholder agriculture. This paper explores methodologies that can help improve the study of agricultural innovation processes and their role in transforming agriculture. We examine methods that address three key issues: (a) how agents interact in the production, exchange, and use of knowledge and information; (b) how agents respond individually and collectively to technological, institutional, or organizational opportunities and constraints; and (c) how policy changes can enhance the welfare effects of these interactions and responses. Methods include social network analysis, innovation histories, cross-country comparisons, and game-theory modeling.",

abstract = "Sustainable development should offer a holistic way of resolution of many sharp objective conflicting goals in design. In this context, the question about the stability of models can be raised. The design can be seen as a qualitative discontinuity phenomenon in a continuous background. Understanding and controlling the discontinuity is therefore an important subject of the design research. This paper uses the concepts of the holon and the attractor to analyze the discontinuity. A multi-scale design model is proposed. The proposed multi-scale model is driven by two conflicting drives: (a) completeness of functions and design parameters and (b) discrimination of functions and design parameters. Completeness has been seen as the degree to which a function or a design parameter is recognized to be fully satisfied in a holon. Discrimination can be seen as the degree to which a function (respectively design parameter) refuses to recognize design parameters of other holons. By employing creation of holons as an indicator of the holon's state, we attempt to learn how the holon's behaviour varies as function of completeness and discrimination. Thus two control parameters: (a) completeness of design parameters and (b) completeness of functions, have been defined. The behavior of the holon design defines the output. Then, the discovered possible states of behavior of holon design are: a) impossibility state characterized by the impossibility of holon creation; b) creation-destruction state characterized sometimes by the creation of holons and sometimes the destruction of holons; c) creation-development state characterized by natural creation and development of the holon. The model shows that design is not an orderly and well behaved phenomenon. Design is full of sudden transformations and unpredictable divergences. The task of modeling these problems and relating them to each other would be a challenging endeavor which requires more powerful theory.",

As such systems have a number of properties, which distinguish them from traditional systems, their design requires a new approach to requirements engineering and to product development. While existing contributions concentrate on individual aspects in the design process, there is a lack of a holistic perspective on the design of intelligent systems. Considering the entire design process, would allow for the creation of better functioning designs, as has been demonstrated in various fields of system design. Furthermore, little is known about how people design intelligent systems. A deep understanding about design practices is, though, a prerequisite for coming up with systematic improvements. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, based on interviews, we analyze the design processes undertaken by designers, and present five underlying process archetypes. We focus on how designers identify, select, and consider context across the entire design process. Second, we propose an improved design process for intelligent systems that aims at supporting system designers in their design task in order to serve an organization's, and/or users’ needs.",

Henceforth, overall integrated efforts for addressing the root causes of various health problems with an emphasis on good governance are important. This study presents a range of options for introducing new techniques in the curriculum design and development based on insights from the diverse disciplines of Economics, Policy and Management. The proposed innovative teaching and learning activities include students' involvement in policy dialogues through the departmental setup of Health Policy Networks (HPN); field activities to foster long-term industry linkages; institutional opportunities for students to interact with students of the related programmes in other international universities from the developing and developed countries; and the engagement of students to maintain records of visits and lessons learned for use in future interprofessional development. It is postulated that the typical pedagogy of teaching public health courses in isolation without interaction with experts/students from these diverse fields may only produce routine thinkers instead of healthcare leaders, system thinkers and innovators.",

This conceptual framework inextricably links physical dependence with functional tolerance. Dependence may arise by multiple mechanisms, so that different signs, such as body temperature or CNS excitability, may show different degrees of dependence or may have different time courses. Tolerance may be similarly diverse. It is difficult to test whether tolerance and dependence have the same time course because it is hard to find exactly equivalent signs for such a test. The discrepant data from different laboratories on the rate of recovery from physical dependence may be due to the use of different withdrawal signs as indices. Dissociation of tolerance and dependence has been reported in mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine, where dependence develops without evidence of tolerance. Conversely, tolerance without expression of dependence is seen in experiments on membranes and synapses in vitro. Changes in lipid composition of cell membranes may explain some kinds of tolerance.",

abstract = "This article provides insights into the evaluation of a government-funded action for climate change program. The UK-based program aimed to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage behavioral change through community-led environmental projects. It, thus, employed six community development facilitators, with expertise in environmental issues. These facilitators supported and learnt from 18 community groups over an 18-month period. The paper explores the narratives of the six professional facilitators. These facilitators discuss their experiences of supporting community groups. They also explain their contribution to the wider evaluation of the community-led projects. This paper reflects on the facilitator experience of the program’s outcome-led evaluation process. In turn, it also explores how the groups they supported experienced the process. The facilitator’s narratives reveal that often community-group objectives did not align with predefined outcomes established through theory of change or logic model methodologies, which had been devised in attempt to align to program funder aims. Assisting community action emerges in this inquiry as a stochastic art that requires funder and facilitator willingness to experiment and openness to the possibilities of learning from failure. Drawing on in-depth accounts, the article illustrates that a reflexive, interpretive evaluation approach can enhance learning opportunities and provides funders with more trustworthy representations of community-led initiatives. Yet, it also addresses why such an approach remains marginal within policy circles.",

abstract = "Fueled by the rapid pace of discovery, humankind's ability to understand the ultimate causes of preventable common disease burdens and to identify solutions is now reaching a revolutionary tipping point. Achieving optimal health and well-being for all members of society lies as much in the understanding of the factors identified by the behavioral, social, and public health sciences as by the biological ones. Accumulating advances in mathematical modeling, informatics, imaging, sensor technology, and communication tools have stimulated several converging trends in science: an emerging understanding of epigenomic regulation; dramatic successes in achieving population health-behavior changes; and improved scientific rigor in behavioral, social, and economic sciences. Fostering stronger interdisciplinary partnerships to bring together the behavioral–social–ecologic models of multilevel “causes of the causes” and the molecular, cellular, and, ultimately, physiological bases of health and disease will facilitate breakthroughs to improve the public's health. The strategic vision of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is rooted in a collaborative approach to addressing the complex and multidimensional issues that challenge the public's health. This paper describes OBSSR's four key programmatic directions (next-generation basic science, interdisciplinary research, systems science, and a problem-based focus for population impact) to illustrate how interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives can foster the vertical integration of research among biological, behavioral, social, and population levels of analysis over the lifespan and across generations. Interdisciplinary and multilevel approaches are critical both to the OBSSR's mission of integrating behavioral and social sciences more fully into the NIH scientific enterprise and to the overall NIH mission of utilizing science in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",

In this paper, we propose an agent-based model to investigate the dynamics characterising such interactions and the role that policy intervention can have in governing the niche development process. Specifically, we consider and assess the impact of two policy actions: (1) increasing actors’ expectations towards the new technology by means of information spreading and (2) providing subsidies aimed at stimulating technological switch. Our results confirm the importance of policy intervention and show the dominance of information spreading activities over subsidies. The former policy action, in fact, preserves a broad consensus around the new technology, a fact which turned out to be fundamental in order to promote efficient knowledge diffusion and the effective use of individual and network resources.",

The model was developed to include the dynamics of the lake, the behaviour of agents using phosphorus for agricultural purposes, and the interactions between ecosystem and farmers. Analyses with the model showed that the dominating type of cognitive processing was a relevant factor in the response to uncertainty and policy measures. A higher target level for returns on the use of phosphorus was found to lead to a more intensive use of phosphorus and to higher levels of phosphorus in the lake. Simulated farmers used phosphorus more intensively in situations with high natural variability. A tax on phosphorus had little effect on the behaviour of the farmers when they felt uncertain and had low target levels for returns.",

Some of the key ideas and approaches within this literature are synthesized and reviewed here. Three conceptual elements that, in combination, remain largely absent within the dryland assessment literature, are identified: (1) drylands as political, cultural and economic systems, (2) drylands as complex resilient systems, and (3) drylands as temporally-embedded systems. These conceptual elements are then combined in presenting a new methodological approach, which is based on the participatory modelling of ecosystem services and participatory assessment of future scenarios. It is an approach to environmental assessment that is sensitive to the needs and experience of present and future stakeholders and creates potential avenues for co-operative management decisions and socially-acceptable policies.",

We propose that a computational science approach, particularly agent-based modeling, is a fruitful path for future leadership research.

It is shown that two important theoretical frameworks, thermodynamics of irreversible processes and quantum field theory, exhibit significant convergences on a number of points. They provide a rationale for the appearance of different phases of the same system, for the onset of non-linear self-consistent dynamics able to give rise to domains extended in space and evolving in time in an irreversible way, for the appearance of self-organization which is the main feature of life. A possible dynamical implementation of the thermodynamic concept of negentropy is suggested. The emergence of autocatalytic features is discussed.",

It is stipulated that site expertise shapes the site use and acceptance differently and more profoundly than e-commerce expertise. The results show that users with low (vs. high) site expertise perceived the site as less easy to use, and their site acceptance was more (less) strongly influenced by the site information quality. Alternatively, e-commerce expertise played a different moderating role in the acceptance process, and users with low e-commerce expertise did not perceive the site as less easy to use. The results were replicated in a second study conducted in a different culture. The findings support the research main thesis that expertise is multifaceted and, therefore, considering the different facets is necessary to understand the process of user acceptance of the IT artifact.",

Although there are numerous regulations and standards regarding accessibility in the development of user interfaces, accessibility is nevertheless quite difficult to achieve, let alone to maintain at a high level of quality throughout the development process. This difficulty is due to diverse factors including, but not limited to, the lack of proper development methods, authoring tools and accessibility training for user interface development professionals. In an attempt to offer a solution to these difficulties, this paper proposes a methodological approach for the integration of accessibility requirements into a user interface development method based on User Interface Description Language (UIDL) or, more specifically, on the USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language (UsiXML) framework. The proposed strategy involves the integration of accessibility requirements into design primitives of the user interface development method. This paper focuses on accessibility requirements related to navigation in the Task Model, Abstract User Interface Model and Transformation Model. The application of the approach shown for the SPA4USXML tool also includes a proof of concept and validation of the proposal. The study shows that accessibility requirements included at the design stage in the modelling of user interfaces can be systematized through mechanisms such as new transformation rules and the use of support tools such as SPA4USXML. As a result, the quality of accessibility can be guaranteed by taking advantage of developments in technologies based on User Interface Markup Languages such as UsiXML.",

In recent years, other disciplines have applied this concept in the context of the environmental assessment of products and policies, and multiple perspectives have unfolded more or less in parallel. Among these, the environmental rebound effect (ERE) perspective, focused on efficiency changes and indicators that go beyond energy to multiple environmental issues, has remained relatively unnoticed. This article thus asks the following questions: What are the foundational aspects of the ERE and how these relate to other perspectives? Are there irreconcilable differences between perspectives? And what is the value of the ERE towards a general framework? We map the fundamental ideas behind the ERE and find that the lack of articulation has resulted in inconsistent usage and lack of clarity. We also argue that the ERE offers many valuable insights for rebound assessment, such as the study of broader efficiency changes and of innovations aimed at tackling multiple environmental issues. Perhaps most importantly, the ERE helps bringing together the existing rebound perspectives, as its application shows that it is both possible and valuable to articulate broader definitions for the rebound effect.",

abstract = "Introduction
Providing cost-effective, accessible, high quality patient care is a challenge to governments and health care delivery systems across the globe. In response to this challenge, two types of hospital funding models have been widely implemented: (1) activity-based funding (ABF) and (2) pay-for-performance (P4P). Although health care leaders play a critical role in the implementation of these funding models, to date their perspectives have not been systematically examined.
Purpose
The purpose of this systematic review was to gain a better understanding of the experiences of health care leaders implementing hospital funding reforms within Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.
Methods
We searched literature from 1982 to 2013 using: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Academic Search Elite, and Business Source Complete. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts using predefined criteria. We included 2 mixed methods and 12 qualitative studies. Thematic analysis was used in synthesizing results.
Results
Five common themes and multiple subthemes emerged. Themes include: pre-requisites for success, perceived benefits, barriers/challenges, unintended consequences, and leader recommendations.
Conclusions
Irrespective of which type of hospital funding reform was implemented, health care leaders described a complex process requiring the following: organizational commitment; adequate infrastructure; human, financial and information technology resources; change champions and a personal commitment to quality care.",

It proposes and tests a new theoretical model called the combined methodological approach (CMA). The backbone of this model is an often-overlooked qualitative, bottom-up-driven, slow, small and deep-data-oriented ethnographic research, combined with components or phases of post-occupancy evaluation and behavioural mapping as two user-oriented techniques for assessing usage-space relationships. The paper is rather theoretical, as it focuses on the argumentation of different approaches in city planning, design and governance. However, tests of the proposed model were conducted in public open spaces of four pilot cases in two European cities (Maribor and Ljubljana, in Slovenia). The proposed CMA was tested against its applicability to real urban environments. The results, in accordance with the methodology used, showed that such a combination of often closely related, overlapping and complementary techniques can significantly enhance the understanding of complex relations and interactions between people, space and technology within the city. Hence, it can empower stakeholders towards more informative and responsive measures – and, finally, more inclusive, individualized, tailor-made cities.",

We propose a requirements management framework that enables executives, business managers, software developers and auditors to distribute legal obligations across business units and/or personnel with different roles and technical capabilities. This framework improves accountability by integrating traceability throughout the policy and requirements lifecycle. We illustrate the framework within the context of a concrete healthcare scenario in which obligations incurred from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are delegated and refined into software requirements. Additionally, we show how auditing mechanisms can be integrated into the framework and how auditors can certify that specific chains of delegation and refinement decisions comply with government regulations.",

A set of behavioral rules for each agent involved was formalized in the model and implemented on a NetLogo platform. The simulation results indicated that with the exhaustion of high-carbon nonrenewable energy and stagnant/slow development of low-carbon renewable energy, the number of industrial firm is lowest and that this energy structure cannot sustain the security of their energy supply. Meanwhile, with the development of both high-carbon and low-carbon energy, the number of industrial firms increases sharply compared with the abovementioned condition, but challenges sustainable development. In contrast, the simulation results also indicated that the development of renewable low-carbon energy ensures the energy supply security of industrial firms, and furthermore, that the best way to sustained a greater number of industrial firms is to decrease the energy consumption of the industrial firms themselves. This means that low-carbon awareness and the behavior of firms play a significant role in developing low-carbon energy. Consequently, based on the simulation results, China’s energy policy should be to develop low-carbon energy and utilize fossil fuel cleanly and efficiently, while improving firms’ behavior and their capacity to absorb new low-carbon energy technologies.",

abstract = "In the paper an IT infrastructure for supporting the shift from organization-centric to patient-centric model of healthcare service delivery to facilitate collaborative, multidisciplinary and cross-organizational healthcare delivery processes is presented. The core of this infrastructure is an internet platform that provides e-services and promotes the interoperability by enabling not only inter-communication among authorized healthcare professionals, but also sharing the Virtual Healthcare Record, an authoritative, multi-dimensional view on the patient health state. The platform is implemented in the LuMiR project for Basilicata, an Italian region where integration of healthcare applications is required. The LUMIR approach, its origin and peculiarities are briefly presented. The project’s final target is the regional health digital ecosystem that interacts with the healthcare system for better supporting it. The agent-oriented paradigm emerges as a promising approach to map the autonomic healthcare systems and their users in virtual entities, and to add values such as flexibility, adaptability, and reusability. over traditional object- or service-oriented approaches.",

abstract = "Under a variety of conditions, stochastic and non-linear systems with many degrees of freedom tend to evolve towards complexity and criticality. Over the last decades, a steady proliferation of models re: far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics of metastable, many-valued systems arose, serving as attributes of a ‘critical’ attractor landscape. Building off recent data citing trademark aspects of criticality in the brain—including: power-laws, scale-free (1/f) behavior (scale invariance, or scale independence), critical slowing, and avalanches—it has been conjectured that operating at criticality entails functional advantages such as: optimized neural computation and information processing; boosted memory; large dynamical ranges; long-range communication; and an increased ability to react to highly diverse stimuli. In short, critical dynamics provide a necessary condition for neurobiologically significant elements of brain dynamics. Theoretical predictions have been verified in specific models such as Boolean networks, liquid state machines, and neural networks. These findings inspired the neural criticality hypothesis, proposing that the brain operates in a critical state because the associated optimal computational capabilities provide an evolutionarily advantage. This paper develops in three parts: after developing the critical landscape, we will then shift gears to rediscover another inroad to criticality via stochastic quantum field theory and dissipative dynamics. The existence of these two approaches deserves some consideration, given both neural and quantum criticality hypotheses propose specific mechanisms that leverage the same phenomena. This suggests that understanding the quantum approach could help to shed light on brain-based modeling. In the third part, we will turn to Whitehead's actual entities and modes of perception in order to demonstrate a concomitant logic underwriting both models. In the discussion, I briefly motivate a reading of criticality and its properties as responsive to the characterization of tenets from Eastern wisdom traditions.",

To offer practical guidance to nurse investigators interested in multidisciplinary research that includes assisting in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for “smart” health management and aging-in-place.
Methods
Ten health-assistive Smart Homes were deployed to chronically ill older adults from 2015 to 2018. Data were collected using five sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity). Nurses used telehealth and home visitation to collect health data and provide ground truth annotation for training intelligent algorithms using raw sensor data containing health events.
Findings
Nurses assisting with the development of health-assistive AI may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. We recommend: (a) using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data, (b) using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform.
Conclusions
Practical frameworks to guide nurse investigators integrating clinical data with sensor data for training machine learning algorithms may build capacity for nurses to make significant contributions to developing AI for health-assistive Smart Homes.",

The evolving granular neural network (eGNN) is able to handle gradual and abrupt parameter changes typical of nonstationary (online) environments. eGNN builds interpretable multi-sized local models using fuzzy neurons for information fusion. An online incremental learning algorithm develops the neural network structure from the information contained in data streams. We focus on trapezoidal fuzzy intervals and objects with trapezoidal membership function representation. More precisely, the framework considers triangular, interval, and numeric types of data to construct granular fuzzy models as particular arrangements of trapezoids. Application examples in classification and function approximation in material and biomedical engineering are used to evaluate and illustrate the neural network usefulness. Simulation results suggest that the eGNN fuzzy modeling approach can handle fuzzy data successfully and outperforms alternative state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, transparency and compactness.",

There is a huge amount of knowledge encapsulated in conferences and journals targeting this area, but a systematic analysis of that knowledge is missing. For this reason, we aim to investigate the state-of-the-art of the CBSE area through a detailed literature review. To do this, 1231 studies dating from 1984 to 2012 were analyzed. Using the available evidence, this paper addresses five dimensions of CBSE: main objectives, research topics, application domains, research intensity and applied research methods. The main objectives found were to increase productivity, save costs and improve quality. The most addressed application domains are homogeneously divided between commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), distributed and embedded systems. Intensity of research showed a considerable increase in the last fourteen years. In addition to the analysis, this paper also synthesizes the available evidence, identifies open issues and points out areas that call for further research.",

This paper was prepared by the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Working Group on Translational Research and Knowledge Transfer. The goal was to nurture common ground upon which to build a platform for translating what we know about cancer into what we do in practice and policy.
Methods
Methods included expert panels, literature review, and concept mapping, to develop a framework that built on earlier cancer control conceptualizations of communications that have guided researchers and end users.
Results
The concept of ‘knowledge integration’ is used to describe the resulting refinement and the nature of evidence necessary for decision-making to at the systems level. Current evidence for knowledge integration in cancer control is presented across the levels of individual, organizational and systems level interventions and across basic, clinical and population science knowledge bases.
Conclusion
A systems-oriented approach to integrating evidence into action assists organizations to conduct research and policy and practice.
Practice implications
Practitioners can use this framework to understand the challenges of implementing and evaluating cancer control strategies.",

Available data are numerous, at multiple levels of analysis, and snapshots in time, which makes application difficult in a dynamically changing healthcare system. One potential solution is computational modeling. We describe our use of OrgAhead, a theoretically based computational modeling program developed at Carnegie Mellon University, to transform data into actionable nursing information. We calibrated the model by using data from 16 actual patient care units to adjust model parameters until performance of simulated units ordered in the same way as observed performance of the actual units 80% of the time. In future research, we will use OrgAhead to generate hypotheses about changes nurses might make to improve patient outcomes, help nurses use these hypotheses to identify and implement changes on their units, and then measure the impact of those changes on patient outcomes.",

Since crude oil resources are predominately located in the OPEC Middle East, these countries are expected to have significant leverage in the world crude oil markets by taking into account a range of uncertainties. In this study, we develop a scenario for crude oil export and production using the ACEGES model considering uncertainties in the resource limits, demand growth, production growth, and peak/decline point. The results indicate that the country-specific peak of both crude oil export and production comes in the early this century in the OPEC Middle East countries. On the other hand, they occupy most of the world export and production before and after the peak points. Consequently, these countries are expected to be the key group in the world crude oil markets. We also find that the gap between the world crude oil demand and production broadens over time, meaning that the acceleration of the development of ultra-deep-water oil, oil sands, and extra-heavy oil will be required if the world continuous to heavily rely on oil products.",

To understand the socioeconomic drivers of urbanization and project future urban landscape changes, multi-agent systems provide a powerful tool. We develop an agent-based model of urban growth for the Phoenix metropolitan region of the United States, which simulates the behavior of regional authorities, real estate developers, residents, and environmentalists. The BDI (Beliefs–Desires–Intentions) structure is employed to simulate the agents behavior and decision models. The heterogeneity of agents is reflected by adjusting parameters according to the agents’ beliefs, desires and preferences. Three scenarios, baseline, economic development priority and environmental protection, are developed and analyzed. The combination of multi-agent system and spatial regression model is employed to predict the future urban development of the Phoenix metropolitan region. Landscape metrics are used to compare the spatial patterns of the urban landscape resulting from different scenarios in different times. In general, with the rapid urban expansion, the shape of urban patches will become more regular as many of them become coalesced. The spatial analysis of urban development through modeling individual and group decisions and human–environment interactions with a multi-agent systems approach can enhance our understanding of the socioeconomic driving forces and mechanisms of urban development.",

In parallel with the emergence of a research agenda for this new sub-discipline, pioneers of the subject began to consider the nature of education in process systems engineering, and its relationship to the broader chemical engineering curriculum. In this paper, a personal view of the history of the development of education in our field will be given. It will be argued that two complementary approaches have been pursued, each of which has played an important role both within the sub-discipline itself and in the context of the development of chemical engineering education more broadly. On the one hand, pedagogical materials have been developed and courses delivered covering important advances in process systems engineering as they have emerged from the research community. As a result, the teaching of design and control methodologies, techniques and tools has become more systematic and comprehensive in the past four decades, reflecting the strides made by the research community in tackling these complex engineering problems. In parallel with these developments, educators have been concerned to develop curricula and courses designed to help students to adopt a ‘systems approach’ to engineering problem solving. Here, the objective has been not so much to help students to learn about the application of specific ideas and methods to particular classes of engineering problem. Rather the aim has been to encourage students to adopt a particular, systematic approach to their entire professional practice. Advances in both directions will be illustrated through examples taken from the literature, as well as through an account of the process systems engineering components of the chemical engineering course at Imperial College. Finally, the author will present his personal view on developments which are likely to emerge in the future, as process systems engineering and chemical engineering continue to respond to external changes as well as to the continuing development of our subject.",

This paper adapts the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework to the requirements and challenges of FEW nexus governance and sets a special focus on action situations, actors, and institutions. The analysis thus contributes to the debate about the practicality and benefits of a comprehensive FEW nexus policy approach. Two different conceptual FEW nexus frameworks are developed, which span the spectrum of possible integration options. The first one describes a holistic integration framework that defines the FEW nexus as a single, fully integrated system. The second one represents vertical policy integration and is largely based on existing structures and a reframing of the present institutional setting. After their theoretical derivation, the two hypothetical frameworks are analyzed with respect to their strengths and weaknesses in governing the FEW nexus using two sample cases of integrated FEW nexus governance in Germany. The results show that effective FEW nexus governance requires a combination of both integration options.",

The effectiveness of workflow analysis becomes critical to understanding the impact of these perturbations on patient outcome. The typical methods used for workflow analysis, such as ethnographic observations and interviewing, are limited in their ability to capture activities from different perspectives simultaneously. This limitation, coupled with the complexity and dynamic nature of clinical environments makes understanding the nuances of clinical workflow difficult. The methods proposed in this research aim to provide a quantitative means of capturing and analyzing workflow. The approach taken utilizes recordings of motion and location of clinical teams that are gathered using radio identification tags and observations. This data is used to model activities in critical care environments. The detected activities can then be replayed in 3D virtual reality environments for further analysis and training. Using this approach, the proposed system augments existing methods of workflow analysis, allowing for capture of workflow in complex and dynamic environments. The system was tested with a set of 15 simulated clinical activities that when combined represent workflow in trauma units. A mean recognition rate of 87.5% was obtained in automatically recognizing the activities.",

Drawing on case studies in Ethiopia and Honduras, the paper examines the synergies and tensions between market systems and climate resilience approaches. The study finds that the market systems interventions have contributed to climate resilience, but also evidence of significant limitations due to fundamental tensions between market system and resilience approaches in terms of what their goals are, who they target, and how they approach their objectives. This study has important implications for the design and implementation of climate resilience programs and policies, as well as the expectations that agricultural development programs will be able to build climate resilience. Recognizing the inherent tensions that exist between market systems approaches and resilience approaches and explicitly discussing the trade-offs between the goals, target audiences, and primary mechanisms of each approach would represent an important step forward if market systems programs are going to contribute to climate resilience.",

abstract = "How do technologies develop? This study proposes the theory of technological parasitism that is based on the idea that parasite-host relationships between technologies and technologies with a high number of technological parasites have an accelerated evolution driven by long-run mutualistic symbioses, providing the basis for extensive macroevolution and adaptive behavior of systems of interactive technologies in markets. This theory may be useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize the evolution of technology directed to sustain competitive advantage of firms and nations. In particular, technological parasitism explains the relationship of mutualistic symbiosis between a host (or master) technology and inter-related technologies to satisfy needs and/or to solve consequential problems of socioeconomic subjects over time. To explore the potential of adopting a theory of technological parasitism and to predict which technologies are likeliest to evolve rapidly, this study implements a theoretical test based on a computational agent-based model developed from these concepts and a empirical test based on historical data on the evolution of four example technologies (aircraft, tractor, locomotive and bicycle technology). Computational and empirical evidence are broadly consistent with the theoretical expectation that host (or master) technologies with many associated parasitic technologies advance rapidly, whereas master technologies with fewer parasitic technologies improve slowly. The proposed theory has a demonstrated capacity to explain relationships between technologies in complex systems that clarify the driving forces of the evolution of technology in markets. The finding of this study could aid management of firms and innovation strategy of nations to implement best practices of product/process design and development for supporting R&D of technologies that are likely to evolve rapidly, sustaining and safeguarding competitive advantage. Overall, then, this study, for the first time to our knowledge, begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, the role of long-run coevolution between host and parasitic technologies in complex systems, suggesting fruitful implications for innovation management. markets. This conceptual scheme here is especially relevant in Schumpeterian markets with innovation-based competition to explain a major source of technological evolution and success, the parasite-host relationships between technologies. Finally, this theory here suggests a new direction for the development of more sophisticated concepts and theoretical frameworks to explain technological and industrial change in economic systems.",

The aim of this paper is to review the available works in this field and propose an approach for supporting policymakers in the taking decision process of deploying sustainable bioenergy systems. The SIByl-LACAf framework provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the inherent complexity of the subject and its sustainability and acceptability as part of the evaluation process. With this approach, different and complementary evaluation methods are reviewed and set in a logical and sequential structure to draw a group of indicators used for assessing a given project with the help of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) matrix. When acceptability is identified as an issue, a Public Consultation and Communication (PC&C) scheme can complement this process. The suggested application for Mozambique indicate that an acceptable outcome is possible even when considering the data requirements and constraints of developing countries. Thus, the potential of this integrated approach outweighs such limitations.",

We thus propose an evolving framework that explains how the generative variation of innovative change and adaption follow two interconnected logics that explain the SOI dynamics. First, we study the time-evolving transformation that encourages companies to transform dynamic capabilities following a path-dependent logic. Second, we study organizational transformations that enhance self-reinforcement among strategic sustainability dimensions. This conceptualization contributes to the theoretical underpinnings of SOI, providing new insights on how SOI transforms dynamic capabilities for innovation and adapts companies' strategic sustainability.",

abstract = "The United States Army is undergoing a re-definition of its Civil Affairs officer positions. A recent project to define the educational requirements for an Army Civil Affairs Officer (38G) identified an educational requirement to help officers understand the complex ways in which the operations that advance the achievement of one stabilization objective often hinder the achievement of other objectives. The system level thinking was seen to be frequently insufficiently ingrained amongst Civil Affairs Officers (and the leaders they advised), who were both often perceived to be inclined, in the face of the complexities of the situation on the ground, to become too narrowly focused on achieving their specific assigned responsibilities, limiting their ability to see how the mission effectiveness of what they were recommending would be influenced by the state and trajectory of other Sectors and how, in turn, their recommendations would influence the mission effectiveness of other Sector stewards. While system dynamics modeling has proven itself to be effective in capturing and effectively communicating feedback loops that define such non-linear (and non-intuitive) systems they do not, in themselves, provide sufficient modeling richness to comprehensively capture the critical spatial (geographical) determinants of a successful state reconstruction process. For these purposes, a multi-agent cellular automata model is recommended both as a vehicle for introducing students to the complex nature of the state reconstruction process and, eventually, for use in the field by deployed Civilian Affairs Officers at all levels. This paper describes the problem and the modeling approach to address it.",

abstract = "The complex dynamics of the human-centered natural and built environment (HNBE) have been characterized by emerging and diverging conceptions of resilience (e.g., climate resilience, disaster resilience, social-ecological resilience). Each resilience modifier has produced rich bodies of literature, drawing on distinctive meanings of the term “resilience.” As resilience modifiers have continued to multiply and evolve over the past three decades, the relationships among them have become less clear. This impedes effective management of resilience in a more integrated HNBE. To improve understanding of the evolution and commonalities of resilience modifiers, we surveyed 3,181 articles concerning seven resilience modifiers published from 1990 to 2018. Using bibliometric analysis tools, we clarify lexical meanings of these resilience concepts and find a convergence among them based on their shared concerns and intellectual genealogy. This converging conception of resilience may motivate and catalyze more integrated knowledge, methods, and expertise in understanding and managing resilience across disciplines.",

The coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1) detailed empirical analyses at a micro–meso level of the challenges relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level interaction of social and technological elements within potential transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal, multi-level evolutionary economic models.",

Relatedly, collaborative and network governance is increasingly considered essential for the sustainability of urban social-ecological-technical systems. However, empirical evidence explicitly linking metropolitan networks to resilience planning and implementation is sparse. We address this gap by researching a network of organizations pursuing resilience strategies within and across two major metropolitan areas in Texas – Austin and San Antonio. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach that includes qualitative and social network analysis (descriptive and exponential random graph modeling), we examine the factors that drive network formation around blue-green infrastructure in the study area. The planning and implementation of general resilience strategies across metropolitan jurisdictional boundaries is dependent upon the social infrastructure available for governance (i.e., the relationships among organizations engaged in resilience building activities). Our findings demonstrate the tendency for network closure as a key governance feature for resilience implementation. Providing urban policy-makers and planners with information about why networks form can facilitate implementation of blue-green infrastructure in this rapidly growing, climate change impacted region and beyond. Applying a network paradigm provides insights to build general resilience for adaptation and transformation in metropolitan systems.",

Bacteria exhibit cell-to-cell variability in their resilience to stress, for example, following antibiotic exposure. Higher resilience is typically ascribed to “dormant” non-growing cellular states. Here, by measuring membrane potential dynamics of Bacillus subtilis cells, we show that actively growing bacteria can cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics through an alternative mechanism based on ion flux modulation. Specifically, we observed two types of cellular behavior: growth-defective cells exhibited a mathematically predicted transient increase in membrane potential (hyperpolarization), followed by cell death, whereas growing cells lacked hyperpolarization events and showed elevated survival. Using structural perturbations of the ribosome and proteomic analysis, we uncovered that stress resilience arises from magnesium influx, which prevents hyperpolarization. Thus, ion flux modulation provides a distinct mechanism to cope with ribosomal stress. These results suggest new approaches to increase the effectiveness of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and reveal an intriguing connection between ribosomes and the membrane potential, two fundamental properties of cells.",

With a series of case studies ranging from the combined use of structural and functional attributes of the system, to modelling outputs that integrate the biological and physical environments, we illustrate the usefulness and complementarities of these methods to assess ecosystem health. The choice of relevant indicators will depend on the ecological questions raised as well as the biological and habitat components considered which can range from a single level (individual or population) to multiple levels (community or ecosystem-based indicators) in the ecosystem. Each method has its own capabilities and limitations that may render it useful or insufficient in some cases.

In particular, optimizing visual and thermal comfort simultaneously is a difficult topic due to mutual conflicts between them. This literature review article studies the façade, as a complex interface between inside of buildings and the outside that has a capability to function as a protective or regulatory element against severe fluctuations of external climate. Six interrelated subjects are studied including kinetic façade, biomimicry, building form as a microclimate modifier, energy efficiency, comfort condition, parametric design thinking. The literature review process answers following research questions: (1) what are the interdisciplinary subjects corresponding to kinetic façade design process for creating an innovative architectural process? (2) What is the most important factor in kinetic façade design with the aim to improve occupants’ visual and thermal comfort simultaneously based on multidisciplinary investigation? Many research has been carried out about kinetic façade concepts strategies, principles, and criteria. However, interdisciplinary studies for proposing kinetic façade form is relatively rare. Also, adaptive daylight façade with daily solar geometry variation has been highly required. Therefore, generative-parametric and quick form finding method for responding to different climates would be a solution for providing more adaptability to dynamic daylight. This study aims to propose a kinetic façade design process which have capability to improve occupant visual & thermal comfort simultaneously by controlling on-site renewable energy resources consist of solar radiation and wind. Façade as an only interface between inside and outside of building, far from the literal and historical perceptions, is recognized by intrinsic functional attributes including complexity, heterogeneity and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the interrelated subjects impact façade form individually and aggregately regard to functional scenario that is changed the perception of kinetic façade from elegant and fashionable state to a functional and practical element.",

Whilst conceptions of social learning are contested, most perspectives raise questions about the nature of knowledge and knowing. It is argued that becoming aware of our assumptions regarding learning, knowing and how we develop knowledge, can help us find out more about what we need to know. The nature of resource dilemmas, implications for learning, what learning involves, its interdisciplinary nature and its history of ideas are all considered. An overview of learning theories is given, explaining their potential relevance for researchers, policymakers and practitioners in environmental contexts. The discourse, theory and practice of social learning and factors that influenced the choice of social learning theories by SLIM researchers are discussed.

Those who study human ecodynamics reject the notion that humans should be considered external to the environments in which they live and have lived for millennia. Many are interested in the resilience and sustainability of past human-natural configurations, often striving to extract lessons from the past that can benefit society today. H.E. research, involving the study of paleoenvironments and archaeology, has taken shape around a series of methodological advances that facilitate the study of past chronology, paleoecology, paleodemography, mobility, trade, and social networks. It is only through integrated study of 'coupled human-natural systems'—'socio-ecosystems'—that we can hope to understand dynamic human-environmental interactions and begin to manage them for sustainable goals. Local and traditional or Indigenous knowledge provides another important influence to human ecodynamics research, and we explore how such knowledge can provide both expert witness into the operation of socioecological systems and insight into the human/cultural dimensions of those systems. Ultimately, we conclude that human ecodynamics is more encompassing than a number of related approaches and can provide a nexus for productive research. Through its interdisciplinary breadth, the framework unites scholarship that tends to be more isolated to address complex problems that are best tackled with diverse perspectives.",

abstract = "Transformative actions are increasingly being required to address changes in climate. As an aid to understanding and supporting informed decision-making regarding transformative change, we draw on theories from both the resilience and vulnerability literature to produce the Adaptation Action Cycles concept and applied framework. The resulting Adaptation Action Cycles provides a novel conceptualisation of incremental and transformative adaptation as a continuous process depicted by two concentric and distinct, yet linked, action learning cycles. Each cycle represents four stages in the decision-making process, which are considered to be undertaken over relatively short timeframes. The concept is translated into an applied framework by adopting a contextual, actor-focused suite of questions at each of the four stages. This approach compliments existing theories of transition and transformation by operationalising assessments at the individual and enterprise level. Empirical validation of the concept was conducted by collaborating with members of the Australian wine industry to assess their decisions and actions taken in response to climate change. The contiguous stages represented in the Adaptation Action Cycles aptly reflected the diverse range of decision-making and action pathways taken in recent years by those interviewed. Results suggest that incremental adaptation decision-making processes have distinct characteristics, compared with those used in transformative adaptation. We provide empirical data to support past propositions suggesting dependent relationships operate between incremental and transformative scales of adaptation.",

In multi-UAV operations, a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed to carry out missions such as search and rescue, or disaster relief. This paper discusses multi-UAV system in the face of disruptions from a system-of-systems perspective. Each UAV, with some decision-making capability, is assigned a task to perform within a multi-UAV system. When these vehicles operate in an open operational environment, the ability to cope with disruptive events becomes especially important. In other words, multi-UAV system needs to be resilient. A methodological framework to dynamically evaluate resilience alternatives during mission operation is discussed in this paper. This framework allows system to select appropriate alternative given the current context. Simulation results show that such framework can be created and used dynamically to evaluate resilient alternatives for multi-UAV system.",

This article presents a systematic literature review of how LP has dealt with complexity, both in theory and in practice, from a complexity science perspective. The review was based on 94 papers, which were analyzed according to seven criteria: how the concept of complexity is being used in lean research; the complexity level of the studied systems; the compatibility between the methodological approach and the nature of complexity; how complexity is managed by LP; barriers to LP in CSS; side-effects of LP in CSS; and whether complexity is always detrimental to LP.

Surveillance systems are increasingly needed to provide security for citizens and infrastructures. Currently there are many buildings that are equipped with cameras, sensors or microphones. However, it is difficult to find tools that integrate the information from these sources in a homogeneous system. On the other hand, the intruder detection is increasingly demanded in the corporate, commercial or private sector. For these reasons, we propose a multi-sensor intelligent system that uses information from several sources analysis (video, audio and other sensors) to identify dangerous or interest intrusions. So, we have designed a generic ontology that allows to integrate in a homogeneous way all the input heterogeneous knowledge. To perform the intrusion analysis, we propose a rule-based model, which process all the information obtained from the monitored environment. This model is easily customizable and adjustable, since the rules that define an intrusion in a semantic way can be configured depending on the scenario and circumstances. The system generates an alarm whenever an intrusion is detected. Besides, this alarm is also notified via mobile devices. So, the system reports in real time according to device capabilities, generating a context-sensitive notification.",

We propose a model in which experience emerges from the dynamic interactions of specialized component processes via a distributed neural network. Such a model offers a mechanism to explain several empirical observations of the neural correlates of perceptual awareness, cognitive function, and symptoms of neurological damage.",

We selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. The answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. Our findings suggest that EUD, EUP and EUSE are active research topics not only in Human–Computer Interaction, but also in other research communities. However, little cross-fertilization exists among the three themes, as well as unifying frameworks and approaches for guiding novice designers and practitioners. Other findings highlight trends and gaps related to the analysis’ dimensions, which have implications on the design of future tools and suggest open issues for further investigations.",

This paper presents an evolutionary modelling technique (cladistics) which could enable organisations to systematically manage and understand the emergence of new manufacturing forms within their business environment. This fundamental, but important insight is valuable for achieving successful organisational design and change. Thus, regardless of the industrial sector, managers could use cladistics as an evolutionary analysis technique for determining “where they have been and where they are now”. Moving from a non-agile manufacture to an agile manufacture is a process of organisational change and evolutionary development. This evolutionary method will enable organisations to understand the landscape of manufacturing possibilities that exist, to identify appropriate agile forms and to successfully navigate that landscape.",

After more than a decade of theoretical development and a large quantity of empirical work, the field of resilience is beginning to recognize the methodological challenges related to operationalizing and designing studies of complexity. This paper reviews a sample of empirical articles on studies of resilient healthcare to describe and synthesize their methodological strategies. The review found that data collection by resilient healthcare studies has predominantly been conducted at the micro level (e.g. frontline clinical staff). Data sources at the meso level (i.e. hospital/institution) have been limited, and no studies were found that collected macro-level data. We argue that the methodological focus in the field should increase its embrace of complexity and the adaptive capacities of the system as a whole by integrating data sources at the micro, meso, and macro levels. To improve the methodological designs, we argue that the resilience construct, in which the complexity of multiple levels is integrated, must be developed. Improving the transparency and quality of future resilient healthcare research might be accomplished by reporting thorough descriptions of analytical strategies, in-depth descriptions of research design and sampling strategies, and discussing internal and external validity and reflexivity.",

abstract = "Increasingly the body of knowledge derived from strategy theory has been criticized because it is not actionable in practice, particularly under the conditions of a knowledge economy. Since strategic management is an applied discipline this is a serious criticism. However, we argue that the theory-practice question is too simple. Accordingly, this paper expands this question by outlining first the theoretical criteria under which strategy theory is not actionable, and then outlines an alternative perspective on strategy knowledge in action, based upon a practice epistemology. The paper is in three sections. The first section explains two contextual conditions which impact upon strategy theory within a knowledge economy, environmental velocity and knowledge intensity. The impact of these contextual conditions upon the application of four different streams of strategy theory is examined. The second section suggests that the theoretical validity of these contextual conditions breaks down when we consider the knowledge artifacts, such as strategy tools and frameworks, which arise from strategy research. The third section proposes a practice epistemology for analyzing strategy knowledge in action that stands in contrast to more traditional arguments about actionable knowledge. From a practice perspective, strategy knowledge is argues to be actionable as part of the everyday activities of strategizing.",

In this paper, the topic is approached in an interdisciplinary bio-inspired way. The transferability of biological self-healing principles to the recovery of supply network disruptions is analysed and first propositions are derived. A single case study of the Japanese microcontroller company Renesas Electronics is analysed with regard to the developed propositions. A strategically important plant of Renesas was severely damaged by the triple disaster in Japan in 2011 which led to a disruption of the company's supply network. Five out of six propositions regarding the transferability of biological self-healing are, at least partly, proven. Furthermore, the importance of close collaboration within a network of suppliers, customers and competitors is emphasized. The results make further research in this academically still underdeveloped field promising, especially with regard to implications and strategies for supply chain risk managers.",

abstract = "Background
High profile accounts of failures in patient care reflect an urgent need for transformational development in healthcare. Appreciative Inquiry is promoted as an approach to exploring and bringing about change in social systems. Appreciative Inquiry has been used extensively in North American business since the late 1980s. The application of Appreciative Inquiry may have merit in the complex world of human health experiences.
Objectives
To identify, evaluate and synthesise the evidence about the impact of Appreciative Inquiry on changing clinical nursing practice in in-patient settings.
Design
An integrative review and narrative synthesis.
Setting
In-patient settings including paediatrics, maternity and mental health.
Participants
Nurses of all grades, patients, carers, relatives, other healthcare professionals including allied healthcare staff, management and students.
Data sources
An electronic search of the following electronic databases was performed in January 2015 and updated in July 2015: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (Cochrane database of systematic reviews), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Amed, Assia, Scopus and Web of Science. Hand searching of reference lists of included studies was undertaken. Limits were set to include literature published in English only and publications from 1990 to July 2015.
Review methods
Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility for inclusion and extracted data. Full text articles were systematically appraised using a standardised data extraction instrument in conjunction with criteria to assess whether change using Appreciative Inquiry is transformational.
Results
Eight studies (reported in 11 papers) met the inclusion criteria. Overall, these studies demonstrate poor application of Appreciative Inquiry criteria in a nursing context. This makes judgement of the impact difficult. One study achieved transformation against agreed criteria for Appreciative Inquiry. Other included studies demonstrated that Appreciative Inquiry is being perceived as a gateway to knowledge translation rather than transformative change in practice.
Conclusions
Appreciative Inquiry offers potential for nurse practice development and change but not without cognisance of the pivotal components. If Appreciative Inquiry is to be perceived as a legitimate research endeavour, there must be engagement and attention to rigour. Findings suggest caution is required against the choreography of Appreciative Inquiry where participant experiences are moulded to fit a previously drafted master plan. Further research is needed to explore the role of expert facilitation in securing and sustaining successful outcomes of Appreciative Inquiry.",

abstract = "In this paper, applicability of modeling global aircraft aerodynamic-propulsive coefficients using a design of experiments technique based on a linear parameter-varying model is investigated. The proposed technique consists of a local estimation phase and a global identification phase. For the local estimation phase, a set of multiple orthogonal phase-optimized multi-sine inputs (elevator, aileron, rudder, and throttle) is executed at different locations over the operational flight envelope. The resultant aircraft responses are used to estimate the equivalent stability and control derivatives at each flight condition. Design of experiments is then employed to globally identify the stability and control derivative variations with velocity, altitude, aircraft mass, and center of gravity position. A sequential experiment using a factorial design and augmented face central axial points was employed to model the variation. For demonstrating technique feasibility, a nonlinear simulator for an F-16 was used to assess the proposed approach. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the aircraft response based on the proposed aerodynamic-propulsive model with the actual model. The proposed technique has the capability to deliver a model for a computationally complex and large envelope aerodynamic-propulsive airframe system.",

Wittstock, R. Menzel, Color learning and memory in honey bees are not affected by protein synthesis inhibition, Behav. Neural Biol., 62 (1994) 224–229.]. Most findings argue that the critical time for protein synthesis is during or immediately after training. However, other reports show a second time window, hours after training, where protein synthesis inhibition can cause amnesia [F.M. Freeman, S.P.R. Rose, A.B. Scholey, Two time windows of anisomycin-induced amnesia for passive avoidance training in the day-old chick, Neurobiol. Learn. Mem., 63 (1995) 291–295.][G. Grecksch, H.

In this study, we addressed two questions: (1) Is protein synthesis essential for spatial memory? and (2) At what injection time window(s) will protein synthesis inhibition cause spatial memory amnesia? We report that bilateral intraventricular microinjection of anisomycin (Ani) impairs consolidation of long-term memory, in the hippocampal-dependent Morris water maze spatial memory task. Memory was impaired in a dose-dependent manner without affecting short-term memory. Spatial memory was affected only if Ani was injected 20 min before performing the task and not in any other time window before or after the behavioral test. The inhibition did not affect pre-existing memories or the capability to memorize once the effect of the inhibition diminished.",

abstract = "The future social-technical system (STS) of power supply based on renewables depends heavily upon the rapid emergence of Distributed Energy Systems (DES). The prime object of Social Acceptance processes of renewable energy innovation becomes the issue of how to incorporate DES. The realization of this transformation requires the escape from locked-in hierarchy and standardized design of the centralized grid. This review elaborates the advanced conceptualization of Social Acceptance, particularly its socio-political layer. High diffusion of DES in intelligent microgrids leads to polycentricity replacing hierarchy. Therefore, the main object of 'socio-political acceptance' concerns institutional changes replacing hierarchy by co-production within STSs applying DES. Renewables become 'common goods' in such systems, instead of 'private' or 'public' goods. Systems providing 'common goods' like renewables -that are natural resources-show similarities to socialecological systems, the self-governing entities in common pool resources theory. Application of this institutional theory to co-production in DES leads to the following conclusions on socio-political acceptance. Renewables generation, integration, storage, intelligence and demand response require a shift towards co-producing prosumers. Electricity as an economic good must be redefined from commercial private commodity delivered in a public grid towards a co-produced common good. Essential for common prosumer-based DES is the application of peer-to-peer deliverance (P2P). Policy must avoid to interfere in this and also should remove legal obstructions and transaction costs for P2P and coproduction. As space is the prime scarcity factor for DES, prosumers' communities should also be empowered in co-producing land use decisions for construction of their DES infrastructures.",

abstract = "The objective of this review is to demonstrate the non-linear properties of the Cuban process of agricultural development by characterizing and analyzing recent historical changes in this process, using the theoretical and methodological approach of adaptive renovation cycles. These changes are summed up in four stages: i) The stage of growth, which followed the period of the latifundio (large extensions of land devoted to monoculture or livestock), involved a series of structural changes oriented toward diversifying production and guaranteeing food self-sufficiency; during this stage, the nation's agricultural production was organized into State businesses, State farms, and small farmers' cooperatives. ii) During the stage of agricultural maturity, Cuba adopted the dominant global tendency of increasing productivity through mechanization, based on use of high levels of agrochemicals; this was accompanied by environmental costs, and depended on high priced exports of sugarcane, coffee, tobacco, and citrus, and low priced imports of processed foods to meet the population's dietary needs, through a commercial agreement with the socialist nations of Eastern Europe. iii) The stage of collapse occurred due to the late 1990s economic crisis which resulted in loss of access to markets of machinery, fuels, and other inputs; ensuing problems included soil erosion, groundwater contamination, and deforestation. iv) During the renovation stage, agriculture was reoriented toward cleaner production based on agroecology, organic practices, innovation, and collective learning. At the national level, the Farmer to Farmer Agroecology Movement was developed on rural family farms. Furthermore, the “urban agriculture” movement sprung up on small urban and peri-urban plots. Currently, regardless of the type of land ownership, agriculture in Cuba is oriented toward agroecology and cleaner production.",

In one direction, geomorphic processes and landforms shape the distribution of biota. Conversely, in the other direction, biota modify geomorphic processes and landforms. Increasingly, the interactions between geomorphic and ecological components are more circular and developmentally intertwined. In this paper, I integrate these two independent perspectives within the framework of complexity theory. I outline four themes that characterize complex systems in biogeomorphology: multiple causality and the concept of recursivity, the influence of organisms that function as ecosystem engineers, the expression of an ecological topology, and ecological memory. Implicit in all of these themes is the recognition that biogeomorphic systems are open and path dependent. They may exhibit a range of assembly states, from self-reinforcing stability domains to more transient configurations of organisms and environment.",

The paper demonstrates that port governance is already polycentric, including a variety of actors at different scales with overlapping jurisdictions, but some of the established principles of effective polycentric governance such as collective choice arrangements and distribution of costs are not currently in place. This has resulted in an inability to manage current challenges, which can be broadly divided into environmental challenges (emissions and other pollution, adapting to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and storms) and port investment challenges (conflicts related to port capacity developments). Current static models of port governance exhibit an over-emphasis on hierarchy and internal, formal structures (mostly government, port authority and port terminal operator), whereas a polycentric approach favours explicitly including informal organisations (e.g. citizen and environmental groups) and external actors (e.g. carriers, shipping regulators) in a more dynamic conceptualisation. This enables an application of the known strengths and weaknesses of polycentric governance to the port sector, in order to identify where some of the known measures for successful polycentric governance should be implemented. The paper also feeds back to the theory on polycentric governance regarding the challenges of including global actors within territorial polycentric regimes.",

Here, we explore three distinct forms of homogenization (genetic, taxonomic and functional), and discuss their immediate and future impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes. Our goal is to initiate future research that investigates the broader conservation implications of homogenization and to promote a proactive style of adaptive management that engages the human component of the anthropogenic blender that is currently mixing the biota on Earth.",

In this context, Resilience Theory (RT) has become a potent tool to study socio-ecological systems and, thus, meet these public demands. RT facilitates how to conceptualise the interweaving of behavioural adaptations (e.g., mobility, economy, and social systems) with their external environmental setting. The Adaptive Cycle Model has emerged as a (if not the) key approach in using RT in empirical case studies and its application covers today the entire spatial and temporal field of prehistoric archaeology. However, several challenges remain for research in the future that are summarized in this paper, in particular the lack of a coherent terminology as well as the challenging task of defining the parameters of connectedness and potential are emphasized. Thereby, we show the current pitfalls for approaching the Adaptive Cycle Model and draft the future potential for developing more elaborated systems for classifying resilience in past societies.",

Yet the meaning of “experiment” varies markedly across these domains. We survey the diversity of experimentation, identifying three distinct experimental logics—controlled, Darwinian, and generative. Building on Pragmatist philosophy, we argue that each of these logics has different strengths and weaknesses, but taken together they offer a valuable experimentalist approach to environmental problem-solving. However, from a transdisciplinary perspective, it is important to recognize the different values, purposes, and stances toward knowledge that they entail. Controlled experiments primarily aim to isolate causality, while Darwinian experimentation endeavors to enhance systemic innovation and generative experimentation seeks to generate new solution concepts. Appreciating these differences allows us to be more reflexive about an experimentalist agenda, illuminating the appropriate role of these logics and suggesting possibilities for fruitfully combining them. To advance this reflexive agenda, we also distinguish between epistemic and political learning and argue that experimental approaches to environmental problem-solving may benefit from being more sensitive to this distinction.",

The aim is to present to the Earth Science community ecological and evolutionary concepts and associated recent conceptual developments for linking geomorphology and biota. The novelty of the proposed perspective is that (1) in the presence of geomorphologic-engineer species, which modify sediment and landform dynamics, natural selection operating at the scale of organisms may have consequences for the physical components of ecosystems, and particularly Earth surface processes and landforms; and (2) in return, these modifications of geomorphologic processes and landforms often feed back to the ecological characteristics of the ecosystem (structure and function) and thus to biological characteristics of engineer species and/or other species (adaptation and speciation). The main foundation concepts from ecology and evolutionary biology which have led only recently to an improved conception of landform dynamics in geomorphology are reviewed and discussed. The biogeomorphologic macroevolutionary insights proposed explicitly integrate geomorphologic niche-dimensions and processes within an ecosystem framework and reflect current theories of eco-evolutionary and ecological processes. Collectively, these lead to the definition of an integrated model describing the overall functioning of biogeomorphologic systems over ecological and evolutionary timescales.",

We develop a topology of terrorist infrastructures, introduce the concepts of “enabling” and “coopted” TCIs, and contrast characteristics of TCIs with those of conventional infrastructures. We argue that the organizational intelligence that comes from aligning strategic goals with infrastructural capacity is critical to explaining the prevalence, durability, and resilience of many terrorist organizations (as well as their increasing use of violence). We can understand these emerging organizational forms by their design and development, often flat, mobile, and flexible ‘networks of networks’ themselves.",

Based on 21 selected activities, we found some complementarity across the three parks and that each activity could give rise to multiple CES. Additionally, CES delivery is influenced by a plethora of enablers, threats/constraints, opportunities, and trade-offs, many of which were park-specific and dynamic over time. Although the operating environment which enables CES differed significantly between fenced and open access parks, some enablers, trade-offs and tensions were generic across all three parks. A common tension related to the perception that delivery of CES was secondary to achieving biodiversity conservation, whilst a trade-off existed between the need to increase revenue and tourist numbers and providing quality and meaningful nature experiences. An alternative to the linear cascades model of ecosystem service delivery is suggested to better describe the complex interactions involved in CES delivery.",

Here we apply a social–ecological systems analysis to provide insight into the diverse system interactions that pose impediments to delivery of the Aichi Targets. We applied an analytical framework of pair-wise exchanges along six axes between the social, economic, environmental and political loci of the global social–ecological system. The analysis identified that many impediments result from partial decoupling in the system through phenomena including delayed feedbacks and insufficient information flows. It suggests 15 of the Aichi Targets are unlikely to be delivered; 3 are likely to be delivered in part; and 2 in full. We considered how interventions at leverage points may overcome the impediments, and compared these to actions included within the Implementation Decision for the Aichi Targets, to find gaps. These new leverage points to fill identified gaps involve many aspects of system re-coupling: co-production of knowledge and more equitable food systems governance (environmental–social axis); support for social change movements (social–political axis); an appropriate financial target for biodiversity conservation investment, with a clear means of implementation such as a currency transaction tax (economic–political axis); and co-governance of natural resources (environmental–political axis). The recently released Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 shows that 18 of the 20 Aichi Targets are tracking in accordance with our analysis; and that current efforts are unlikely to result in an improvement in the base state of biodiversity by 2020, confirming some of our results. We argue that attention to the interactions within, and the partial decoupling of, the global social–ecological system provides new insights, and is worthy of further attention both for delivery of the Aichi Targets and for guiding longer term actions for the conservation of biodiversity.",

As such, the concept of business ecosystem is becoming prominent. However, despite the evidences of collaboration benefits, for which some research efforts have been made, there is still a lack of suitable performance indicators and associated metrics to assess those benefits, promoting sustainability and resilience of the members of a collaborative business ecosystem. The analysis of the literature shows that a number of contributions can be found in several research fields, such as enterprise performance indicators, collaboration benefits, value systems, supply chain collaboration, and social network analysis. The purpose of this paper is to survey these areas, highlighting their potential contributions concerning the assessment of collaborative benefits and performance. The analysis also identifies the strengths and weaknesses of current proposals regarding the establishment of adequate performance indicators for collaborative business ecosystems.",

However, the assessment, design, building and maintenance of power systems situated in rural areas in emerging economies present further difficulties because there is no a clear framework for such circumstances. Aiming to address this issue, this paper combines different visions of energy-related resilience both in general and under rural conditions in order to provide a robust practical framework for local and international stakeholders to derive the right actions in the rural context of emerging economies. An in-depth review is implemented to recompile information of resilience in general, in energy systems and in rural areas in particular, and a number of existing frameworks is also consulted. In order to acknowledge the particular circumstances and identify the important factors influencing the resilience of rural electrification in emerging economies, a holistic rural power system resilience framework is developed and presented. This consists of twenty-one indicators for technical resilience, eight indicators for social resilience, and thirteen indicators for economic resilience. This framework can be used by system owners and operators, policy makers, NGOs and communities to ensure the longevity of power systems. This work also paves the way for the creation of appropriate and effective resilience standards specifically targeted for application in these regions - aiming to achieve the delivery of global and local sustainability goals.",

We performed a computer-aided content analysis on 1487 scientific journal articles and 139 western U.S. Forest Service USFS planning documents to answer three questions: 1 how has the use-rate of the word resilience changed over time? 2 are changes in the use-rate of the word resilience correlated with shifts in terminology associated with environmental values, complex systems theory, or environmental change? and, (3) how does the use of the word resilience compare between science and management documents? To ground our interpretations in the context of the word’s technical use, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with scientists and managers working across the region. We found that the word resilience has been used in these documents since the 1980s but that its use sharply increased in both contexts between 2009 and 2011. The use-rate trends differ between science and management documents and do not appear to be associated complex systems terms but do seem associated with increases in the use of terms “climate change” and “adapt” and biocentric values. Finally, although there are differences in how resilience is used between science and management documents, the shared meaning of the term is a hopeful framing for adapting forests to changing conditions. Understanding the emerging use of the word resilience is of critical importance for land use policies that rely on it to signify a central concept, strategy or goal.",

abstract = "Introduction
Infectious diseases present public health challenges worldwide. An emerging integrative approach to treating infectious diseases is using nanoparticle (NP) forms of traditional and alternative medicines. Advantages of nanomedicine delivery methods include better disease targeting, especially for intracellular pathogens, ability to cross membranes and enter cells, longer duration drug action, reduced side effects, and cost savings from lower doses.
Methods
We searched Pubmed articles in English with keywords related to nanoparticles and nanomedicine. Nanotechnology terms were also combined with keywords for drug delivery, infectious diseases, herbs, antioxidants, homeopathy, and adaptation.
Results
NPs are very small forms of material substances, measuring 1–100nm along at least one dimension. Compared with bulk forms, NPs’ large ratio of surface-area-to-volume confers increased reactivity and adsorptive capacity, with unique electromagnetic, chemical, biological, and quantum properties. Nanotechnology uses natural botanical agents for green manufacturing of less toxic NPs.
Discussion
Nanoparticle herbs and nutriceuticals can treat infections via improved bioavailability and antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects. Recent studies demonstrate that homeopathic medicines may contain source and/or silica nanoparticles because of their traditional manufacturing processes. Homeopathy, as a form of nanomedicine, has a promising history of treating epidemic infectious diseases, including malaria, leptospirosis and HIV/AIDS, in addition to acute upper respiratory infections. Adaptive changes in the host's complex networks underlie effects.
Conclusions
Nanomedicine is integrative, blending modern technology with natural products to reduce toxicity and support immune function. Nanomedicine using traditional agents from alternative systems of medicine can facilitate progress in integrative public health approaches to infectious diseases.",

This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the development of Regional Marine Plans which will demand the specification of detailed policies for regulating the various marine uses and impacts in the respective marine regions. The paper discusses a wide range of policy instruments and exemplifies their potential role for the management of marine resources and uses. The term incentive instrument includes financial and economic instruments as well as legal and regulatory instruments, education, co-management, voluntary approaches, community-based mechanisms and research. A set of criteria is established for the evaluation of individual incentive instruments. They are further placed in the context of a series of principles for policy design. The paper explores potential management instruments to: improve water quality of streams, estuaries and oceans, create sustainable fisheries, ensure sustainable marine tourism and recreation, manage conflict between user and interest groups, ensure environmentally sound marine transport and petroleum exploration and mining.",

abstract = "In this study we examine the association of clinical quality and clinical flexibility capabilities on cardiology unit length of stay and cost performance. These relate to the operational performance of cardiology units and capture the timeliness and cost efficiency of cardiac care. We also investigate the complementary role played by the experiential quality in enhancing the impact of clinical quality and clinical flexibility on operational performance measure. Experiential quality relates to patient-centered delivery of care by a hospital. We collect and combine data for 876 U.S. hospitals from four distinct sources and undertake multi-level analyses that consider a hierarchical structure in which the hospital is nested within county and state. To disentangle the effects at the levels of states, counties, and hospitals, we use the mixed-effects modeling approach. The results obtained from econometric analyses indicate that clinical quality and clinical flexibility reduce cardiology unit average length of stay. Clinical flexibility also helps in reducing the average cost of cardiology units. Experiential quality moderates the impact of clinical quality on length of stay and plays a complementary role in the relationship between clinical flexibility and cost. The paper discusses the implications of the findings and presents directions for future research.",

Identifying more sustainable land-use alternatives requires solid theoretical foundations on the causes of land-use/cover changes. Land system science is a maturing field that has produced a wealth of methodological innovations and empirical observations on land-cover and land-use change, from patterns and processes to causes. We take stock of this knowledge by reviewing and synthesizing the theories that explain the causal mechanisms of land-use change, including systemic linkages between distant land-use changes, with a focus on agriculture and forestry processes. We first review theories explaining changes in land-use extent, such as agricultural expansion, deforestation, frontier development, and land abandonment, and changes in land-use intensity, such as agricultural intensification and disintensification. We then synthesize theories of higher-level land system change processes, focusing on: (i) land-use spillovers, including land sparing and rebound effects with intensification, leakage, indirect land-use change, and land-use displacement, and (ii) land-use transitions, defined as structural non-linear changes in land systems, including forest transitions. Theories focusing on the causes of land system changes span theoretically and epistemologically disparate knowledge domains and build from deductive, abductive, and inductive approaches. A grand, integrated theory of land system change remains elusive. Yet, we show that middle-range theories – defined here as contextual generalizations that describe chains of causal mechanisms explaining a well-bounded range of phenomena, as well as the conditions that trigger, enable, or prevent these causal chains –, provide a path towards generalized knowledge of land systems. This knowledge can support progress towards sustainable social-ecological systems.",

abstract = "Purpose
The culture change (CC) movement aims to transform the traditional nursing home (NH) that is institutional in design with hierarchical management structure into a homelike environment that empowers residents and frontline staff. This study examines differences in adoption of CC practices according to a NH's self-reported extent of CC implementation and its duration of CC adoption. Furthermore, it examines differences in adoption by whether a CC practice is considered less versus more complex, using complexity theory as the theoretical framework for this classification.
Design and Methods
Using data from a 2007 Commonwealth-funded study, we analyzed a national sample of 291 US nursing homes that identified as being “for the most part” or “completely” CC facilities for “1 to 3 years” or “3+ years.” Also, using a complexity theory framework, we ranked 16 practices commonly associated with CC as low, moderately, or highly complex based on level of agreement needed to actuate the process (number of parties involved) and the certainty of intended outcomes. We then examined the prevalence of CC-associated practices in relation to their complexity and the extent and duration of a NH's CC adoption.
Results
We found practices ranked as less complex were implemented more frequently in NHs with both shorter and longer durations of CC adoption. However, more complex CC practices were more prevalent among NHs reporting “complete” adoption for 3+ years versus 1 to 3 years. This was not observed in NHs reporting having CC “for the most part.”
Conclusions/Implications
Less complex practices may be more economical and easier to implement. These early successes may result in sufficient momentum so that more complex change can follow. A nursing home that more completely embraces the culture change movement may be more likely to attempt these complex changes.",

However, there exist many common significant challenges to be addressed for the practical realization of these current and envisioned networking paradigms such as the increased complexity with large scale networks, their dynamic nature, resource constraints, heterogeneous architectures, absence or impracticality of centralized control and infrastructure, need for survivability, and unattended resolution of potential failures. These challenges have been successfully dealt with by Nature, which, as a result of millions of years of evolution, have yielded many biological systems and processes with intrinsic appealing characteristics such as adaptivity to varying environmental conditions, inherent resiliency to failures and damages, successful and collaborative operation on the basis of a limited set of rules and with global intelligence which is larger than superposition of individuals, self-organization, survivability, and evolvability. Inspired by these characteristics, many researchers are currently engaged in developing innovative design paradigms to address the networking challenges of existing and envisioned information systems. In this paper, the current state-of-the-art in bio-inspired networking is captured. The existing bio-inspired networking and communication protocols and algorithms devised by looking at biology as a source of inspiration, and by mimicking the laws and dynamics governing these systems are presented along with open research issues for the bio-inspired networking. Furthermore, the domain of bio-inspired networking is linked to the emerging research domain of nanonetworks, which bring a set of unique challenges. The objective of this survey is to provide better understanding of the potentials for bio-inspired networking which is currently far from being fully recognized, and to motivate the research community to further explore this timely and exciting topic.",

I have known him for nearly 40 years and greatly enjoyed his collegiality as well as brilliance in scientific scholarship. He made monumental contributions to 20th century physiological chemistry beginning with his first measurement of H2O2 in rat liver. While continuous H2O2 production is dogma today, the concept of H2O2 production in mammalian tissues was largely buried for half a century. He continued this leadership in research on oxidative stress, GSH, selenium, and singlet oxygen, during the timeframe when physiological chemistry and biochemistry transitioned to contemporary 21st century systems biology. His impact has been extensive in medical and health sciences, especially in nutrition, aging, toxicology and cancer. I briefly summarize my interactions with Helmut, stressing our work together on the redox code, a set of principles to link mitochondrial respiration, bioenergetics, H2O2 metabolism, redox signaling and redox proteomics into central redox theory.",

However, an increasing number of teams have been implementing agile software development methods that focus on people rather than processes. What, then, is maturity for these agile teams that focus less on detailed, defined processes? This is the question we sought to answer in this study. To this end, we asked agile practitioners about their perception of the maturity level of a number of practices and how they defined maturity in agile software development. We used cluster analysis to analyze quantitative data and triangulated the results with content analysis of the qualitative data. We then proposed a new definition for agile software development maturity. The findings show that practitioners do not see maturity in agile software development as process definition or quantitative management capabilities. Rather, agile maturity means fostering more subjective capabilities, such as collaboration, communication, commitment, care, sharing and self-organization.",

Several cases are described whereby the presence of exotic (introduced) zoogeomorphic agents overwhelms a landscape and induce collapse. The impact of climate change on species with zoogeomorphological importance is discussed in the context of resilience of a landscape.

For this reason, techniques such as spectrum sharing, dynamic spectrum access, extraction of signal intelligence and optimized routing will soon become essential components of the IoT wireless communication paradigm. In this vision, IoT devices must be able to not only learn to autonomously extract spectrum knowledge on-the-fly from the network but also leverage such knowledge to dynamically change appropriate wireless parameters (e.g., frequency band, symbol modulation, coding rate, route selection, etc.) to reach the network’s optimal operating point. Given that the majority of the IoT will be composed of tiny, mobile, and energy-constrained devices, traditional techniques based on a priori network optimization may not be suitable, since (i) an accurate model of the environment may not be readily available in practical scenarios; (ii) the computational requirements of traditional optimization techniques may prove unbearable for IoT devices. To address the above challenges, much research has been devoted to exploring the use of machine learning to address problems in the IoT wireless communications domain. The reason behind machine learning’s popularity is that it provides a general framework to solve very complex problems where a model of the phenomenon being learned is too complex to derive or too dynamic to be summarized in mathematical terms. This work provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the application of machine learning techniques to address key problems in IoT wireless communications with an emphasis on its ad hoc networking aspect. First, we present extensive background notions of machine learning techniques. Then, by adopting a bottom-up approach, we examine existing work on machine learning for the IoT at the physical, data-link and network layer of the protocol stack. Thereafter, we discuss directions taken by the community towards hardware implementation to ensure the feasibility of these techniques. Additionally, before concluding, we also provide a brief discussion of the application of machine learning in IoT beyond wireless communication. Finally, each of these discussions is accompanied by a detailed analysis of the related open problems and challenges.",

abstract = "Various empirical studies have evidenced that interaction is a critical process in the development of buyer–seller relationships in business-to-business markets. Research examining the different aspects of interaction processes and the consequences of interaction in business relationships for the development of the businesses involved has tended to black-box the interaction process. Limited attention has been given to how interaction behaviors of individuals arise and the interplay between cognition and behaviors in interaction. At the same time, recent research offers some insights into the use and role of heuristics in contexts analogous to those individual actors face when they interact in business relationships. In this paper we review current research on interaction processes in business relationships as well as on heuristics in the management context and argue that focusing on heuristics used in interaction in business relationships offers valuable insights on how interaction behaviors emerge. In particular, we discuss the notion of heuristics as an “adaptive toolbox,” and how it relates to adaptations in business relationships. We also discuss implications for management and outline a future research agenda.",

abstract = "In a changing world, ecologists have an important role in examining the impacts of environmental changes, and formulating strategies for adapting to these changes, such as engineering sustainable ecosystems that are integrated with human society. Some ecological models supporting these processes need to model species’ adaptive responses to changing conditions. Individual-based models (IBMs) can be used to simulate intergenerational adaptation by implementing model organisms parameterized with structures analogous to genetic chromosomes. IBMs may be calibrated and validated using the pattern-oriented approach, in which model outputs are compared to field data patterns, generally at the end of each simulation. In some circumstances this approach may be limited and computationally expensive when applied to IBMs with adaptive mechanisms. This research explores an approach for using field data patterns, obtained from published research, to guide the evolution of model organisms within each model simulation. An adaptive IBM of an old-field ecosystem consisting of spiders, grasshoppers and plants was constructed using Repast Simphony to demonstrate the approach. The approach produced persistent ecosystem simulations matching aspects of field data patterns, and yielded populations of virtual organisms with phenotypic diversity. The approach produces flexible IBMs and may contribute towards improving model and data sharing within the ecological modelling community.",

Each of these modules has a unique database and a logic that is determined by evolutionary considerations founded on value versus harm. Selection cannot operate to perfection, only to adequacy, meaning not limiting to the procreation of the species. Consequently, this system has limits in that it fails, by human standards, to adequately protect against a variety of pathogens and, even when protecting successfully against others, all too often initiates autoimmunity and innocent bystander pathology. What evolution trivializes defines the subject called clinical immunology. If we wish to deal with the pathology that evolution views to be of an acceptable frequency, then we had best first understand what it did give us as a sufficiently functional system, namely the decision pathways of the three modules and in what ways their protective outputs are limited.",

Through a review of these notions that presently remain isolated from the contemporary mainstream resilience and climate change discourses, this paper proposes an urban morphological theoretical framework that establishes theoretical and empirical links between urban form on the one hand, and climate change adaptation and resilience on the other. With urban morphology as its underpinning, the proposed theoretical framework identifies a set of variables that could potentially influence the resilience of urban form, hence, are proposed to measure its resilience to climate change.

The ABM is used to assess household income and wealth derived from agricultural production of lowland, rain-fed paddy rice and upland field crops in Nang Rong District as well as remittances returned to the household from family migrants who are engaged in off-farm employment in urban destinations. The ABM is supported by a longitudinal social survey of nearly 10,000 households, a deep satellite image time-series of land use change trajectories, multi-thematic social and ecological data organized within a GIS, and a suite of software modules that integrate data derived from an agricultural cropping system model (DSSAT – Decision Support for Agrotechnology Transfer) and a land suitability model (MAXENT – Maximum Entropy), in addition to multi-dimensional demographic survey data of individuals and households. The primary modules of the ABM are the Initialization Module, Migration Module, Assets Module, Land Suitability Module, Crop Yield Module, Fertilizer Module, and the Land Use Change Decision Module. The architecture of the ABM is described relative to module function and connectivity through uni-directional or bi-directional links. In general, the Social Modules simulate changes in human population and social networks, as well as changes in population migration and household assets, whereas the Land Use Modules simulate changes in land use types, land suitability, and crop yields. We emphasize the description of the Land Use Modules – the algorithms and interactions between the modules are described relative to the project goals of assessing household income and wealth relative to shifts in land use patterns, household demographics, population migration, social networks, and agricultural activities that collectively occur within a marginalized environment that is subjected to a suite of endogenous and exogenous dynamics.",

This paper exposes the scope, nature and reasons leading towards policy disintegration within the RUF with critical attention on the separate lenses of the Ecosystem Approach and Spatial Planning frameworks reflecting a marked natural and built environment divide. Using research funded by the Rural Economy and Land Use programme, three ‘bridging’ concepts were identified within which improved integration is explored: Time, Connections and Values. Using team member thoughtpieces and workshops, together with visioning exercises in two rural–urban fringes, a series of narratives are presented within which the RUF opportunity is re-discovered set within a hybridised theory of spatial and environmental planning. In so doing the paper challenges established economic and planning models of urban development and expansion with more holistic ideas and approaches. One size-fits-all solutions such as greenbelts, regionalism or localism are rejected within an approach that champions multi-scalar and sectoral perspectives set within a governance framework that achieves social and economic well-being through maintaining and enhancing ecosystem functions and services. We conclude by arguing that policy strands within environment and planning must be better connected allowing the RUF to be developed as an opportunity space for testing and experimentation.",

abstract = "Over the last two decades, resilience has steadily gained traction in discussions on the theory and practice of adaptation to climate change. The concept is widely considered useful for explaining how coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) resist climate-related stressors or undergo change. At the same time, however, there has been an upswell of critique on resilience and climate-resilient development, stemming most prominently from the quarters of political ecology and human geography. This article seeks to contribute to this literature by using the analytical lens of post-politics to critically evaluate resilience and climate-resilient development in a local adaptation context. Four major critiques are lodged against resilience: (1) its inability to sufficiently recognize the large-scale political, economic, and social forces affecting and effecting change, (2) its oversight of the analyzed systems’ internal dynamics, (3) the depoliticized, techno-managerial nature of resilience-centered solutions, and (4) the theoretical vagueness of resilience as applied by development actors. The paper presents a grounded critique of the term based on empirical evidence collected through a quasi-ethnography of a climate change adaptation project implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government in São Tomé and Príncipe. It is argued that resilience, despite its theoretical attractiveness and growing popularity among donors, continues to dehumanize development and renders adaptation post-political. The article also discusses alternative, more human-centered approaches rooted in vulnerability and climate justice, which offer a more nuanced lens through which to analyze climate impacts and the associated challenges that they pose at the local level.",

Guided by a generic framework for evaluation practice, this paper reports on an inter-disciplinary literature review and argues that STCS raises some new ways of thinking about and carrying out the following six activities: 1) supporting social problem solving; 2) framing interventions and contexts; 3) selecting and using methods; 4) engaging in valuing; 5) producing and justifying knowledge; and 6) facilitating use. Following a discussion of these issues, future directions for research and practice are suggested.",

Main reason for that is the limited applicability of the rigorous methods, and the complexity, sensitivity and design difficulties of the exact linearizing compensators, if any. In the present paper, the literature on the subject is reviewed and organized in what is believed to be a new and consistent perspective. Recent works, especially in the area of data-based techniques, are in fact described and related, whenever possible, to fundamental results previously obtained by model-based differential geometric methods; this is expected to bring modern system linearization methods closer to the needs of practicing control engineers and to stimulate further research eventually able to fill visible gaps in this direction.",

In the present study, retail involvement in direct marketing is considered within the managerial and interpretive contexts of the larger macroenvironment. Notable differences between companies were observed in relation to both contexts. Retailers involved in direct marketing emphasized quality standards and return on investment strategies. They were also more likely to see direct marketing from an opportunistic organizational viewpoint. Results from the study are discussed from a historical perspective taking into consideration the evolutionary differences between store based retailing and direct marketing.",

abstract = "The key phenomenon around which the paper is constructed, given its core interest in the transition from a fossil fuels energy regime to a zero emissions and/or renewable energy regime (sometimes also ‘post-hydrocarbons’ regime; Smith, 2008), is the notion and explanation of ‘transition regions’. These are sub-national territories, usually with some degree of devolved governance in the fields of innovation, economic development and energy that, for reasons to be demonstrated, act as regional ‘lighthouses’ for eco-innovation both to other regions and countries. These are the places that are subject to ‘learning visits’ by global policy-makers and other interested parties eager to learn how success was achieved. Because regions differ within state-systems, the case material is presented according to three kinds of political model. These are, first, the liberal market model, notably north America and the UK; second is the co-ordinated market model such as Germany and some Nordic countries; and third hybrids which have a reasonably entrepreneurial economic climate typical of the ‘liberal market’ model but strong welfare states, more typical of the ‘co-ordinated market’ model such as Denmark, a small state, and China, a large one. Finally, each of six cases will be presented in the sequence of the ‘system’ and regional governance of ‘transition regions’ first, with the nature and role of the national eco-innovation regime summarised afterwards where top-down governmental influence is clearly visible, even weakly. Also eco-innovations that are broadly in the same field, such as renewable energy production, or electric vehicle consumption are studied, giving maximum comparative value from their emergence in different countries and regions.",

abstract = "Viewing humans as drivers of change operating outside the natural environment is unhelpful for defining interventions that effectively manage change and complexity. Indeed, there is now broad agreement that environmental governance needs to consider integrated social-ecological systems (SES) in order to tackle the world’s grand challenges of land degradation. This requires a more differentiated, innovative approach that considers how changes in SES shape the functioning of land systems as a whole, and the synergies and trade-off these changes may produce. In this study, we identify and discuss some of the ways SES science and practice can inspire progress towards land degradation neutrality (LDN) outcomes in an integrated manner, through synthesis of literature and relevant documents related to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). We do these by considering: (i) how LDN has been approached to date and the challenges likely to undermine progress towards achieving it; and (ii) an SES-based LDN approach relevant to the neutrality agenda, in particular, by describing how LDN might be thought of differently through an SES lens. We argue that an SES approach focusing on: (i) “people as part of nature”, not “people and nature”; and (ii) the frame of reference against which neutrality can be assessed across temporal and spatial dimensions, is necessary to both inform policy and guide actions of the different groups involved in avoiding and combating land degradation. Such an (integrated) approach adds a dimension (to achieving neutrality goals) not previously explored in sustainable land management and LDN research. Important next steps in operationalising the SES-based LDN approach involve empirical and field case studies, requiring interdisciplinary, mixed method techniques.",

The central idea is that any transition path can be considered a concatenation of patterns. Although theorising on transitions has advanced greatly, a coherent and integral approach was still lacking. Therefore, the current conceptual language of transitions is reframed and expanded from a complexity view on societal systems. The resulting theoretical framework straightforwardly leads to the identification of the patterns presented. The Dutch healthcare system is used to demonstrate how this multi-pattern approach could be used to describe transitions and make storylines. Furthermore a typology of transition paths derived from this approach is presented as another way in which these patterns may be used.",

In this review, we examine some reported manifestations of neural plasticity in the cardiorespiratory system and classify them into four functional categories, integral; differential; memory; and statistical-type plasticity. At the cellular and systems level the myriad forms of cardiorespiratory plasticity display emergent and self-organization properties, use- and disuse-dependent and pairing-specific properties, short-term and long-term potentiation or depression, as well as redundancy in series or parallel structures, convergent pathways or backup and fail–safe surrogate pathways. At the behavioral level, the cardiorespiratory system demonstrates the capability of associative and nonassociative learning, classical and operant conditioning as well as short-term and long-term memory. The remarkable similarity and consistency of the various types of plasticity exhibited at all levels of organization suggest that neural plasticity is integral to cardiorespiratory control and may subserve important physiological functions.",

Research on urban metabolism has achieved important methodological advancements, such as descriptive analytical frameworks, decision-making models, and resource flow models. However, these contributions have rarely engaged with the transformational potential of designing sustainability solutions for socio-ecological dynamics. This study aims at investigating the current state of the urban metabolism discourse in linking material flows to human well-being, ecological integrity, and social justice, as well as the transformational potential of interventions. To accomplish this, we conducted multivariate statistics of 221 scientific publications, seeking to clarify the normative and transformational aspects considered in the design, context, and products of urban metabolism research. Results differentiated eight clusters of urban metabolism research highlighting the diversity of research along disciplinary and methodological dimensions. We identify pathways to strengthen the conceptualization of a “sustainable urban metabolism” and conclude with suggestions for collaboration between urban metabolism and sustainability research.",

Adaptive governance that involves interdependent state and non-state actors learning and taking action on joint environmental problems is suggested for effective transboundary resource governance. Using the concept of adaptive co-management, the current multi-stakeholder marine governance systems in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania are compared to illuminate opportunities and constraints for adaptive marine transboundary conservation governance between Kenya and Tanzania. The concept of networks and the formal method of social network analysis (SNA) are applied as the main methodological device. Using questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, social network data of 70 organizations (local resources users, government agencies and NGOs) was generated from Kenya (n = 33) and Tanzania (n = 37). Results show the existence of strong collaboration networks for marine resource governance in both Kenya and Tanzania. Social proximity is the common driver of network formation. Collaboration networks in Kenya and Tanzania have contributed to enhanced learning among marine resource managers. Conclusions point to the need to focus on common challenges relating to low levels of rule-compliance, limited access to information on the state of resources and poor integration of science into marine management decisions. Finally, differences in views regarding the state of marine ecosystems need to be addressed to improve prospects for joint problem-solving in marine transboundary conservation.",

Depending on the dynamically changing influence characteristics, time-varying propagation patterns emerge reflecting the temporal structure, strength, and signal-to-noise ratio characteristics of the stimulation driving the online users’ information sharing activity. The proposed model constitutes an overarching, novel, and flexible approach to the modeling of the micro-level mechanisms whereby information propagates in online social networks. As such, it can be used for a comprehensive understanding of the online transmission of information, a process integral to the sociocultural evolution of modern societies.

Over the last decade companies have been continuously improving staff efficiency. As a result, most modern chemical plants can be regarded as lean. Plans to further reduce the number of staff have come under increasing criticism by personnel for safety reasons, and there is strong resistance to further staff reductions. It is clear that management and workers often have conflicting viewpoints for more than just safety reasons; technologists and safety engineers also have different points of view. This results in complex decision-making processes and makes it difficult to realize changes. What can the chemical industries learn from their experiences of decision-making and management with regard to staff reductions? In our exploratory research that used four case studies, we were able to identify and analyse three distinct patterns, with some variations:•Fragmented and incomplete decision-making.•Unintended and undesirable side effects generated by the decision-making and management of change.•Development of difficult dilemmas and ambiguous issues. In this paper, we present a conceptual model that includes factors important for optimizing shifts. This model can serve as a common frame of reference for all agents involved in the decision-making and management process with regard to staffing. The present study was based on four cases, which means our findings serve to form rather than test hypotheses. At this early stage it is not yet possible to generalize from or validate the results, but we plan to go beyond these preliminary results in future research.",

Using a case study approach, effective reformism efforts are analyzed in a technological innovation trajectory related to the implementation of a new poultry husbandry system and an organizational innovation trajectory concerning new ways of co-operation among individual farms to establish economies of scale. The findings reinforce the idea, emerging from a complexity perspective on agricultural innovation systems, that interaction between innovation networks and their environment is only steerable to a limited extent. Nonetheless, innovation networks can enhance effective reformism by creating tangible visions that serve as vehicles to create understanding about the innovation and mobilize support for it, and by employing several kinds of boundary spanning individuals that are able to forge effective connections between innovation networks and their environment. Because innovation networks can only partially influence their institutional environment, and because unintended consequences of actions and random events influence the course of the innovation process, innovation network actors need to continuously re-interpret the contexts in which they move. This constant reflection by the innovating actors on their position vis-à-vis their environment needs to be supported by dedicated facilitators and monitoring and evaluation methods aimed at system learning. This implies that agricultural innovation policies should, instead of aiming to fully plan and control innovation, foster the emergence of such flexible support instruments that enable adaptive innovation management.",

abstract = "An approach to intelligent building energy management systems at the workplace level has the potential to save energy through the use of building information modeling (BIM) and smart sensor systems. Its development focuses on micro-climatization and real-time digitalization systems from an architect's point of view. Intelligent management systems (IMSs) have significant potential for energy savings, but they have not been fully used in buildings and cities. Smart sensor systems based on user behavior will improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and user comfort. A cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach. This work aims to reduce energy consumption and provide comfort conditions by learning user behavior. Furthermore, it seeks to create a real-time system with regard to the functions of developed technologies. In order to improve energy efficiency and comfort conditions, smart sensor systems and digital simulation tools play a crucial role in finding optimal solutions to optimization problems.",

To compare women's reactions to their experiences of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) with their reactions to their previous cesarean birth experiences, to identify the factors that influenced the women's decision to attempt VBAC, and to describe the causes the women ascribed to the outcome of their birth experiences.
Design
An exploratory descriptive study derived from the Roy Adaptation Model of Nursing.
Setting
Hospital postpartum unit.
Participants
Thirty‐two women who had experienced a VBAC.
Main outcome measures
The Perception of the Birth Scale and an investigator‐developed questionnaire.
Results
The women reported moderately positive perceptions of the VBAC experience. However, the mean score was lower than previously reported means for vaginally delivered women. A statistically significant association (χ2=22.70, p<0.0005) was found between type of delivery and adaptive and ineffective responses within the Roy Adaptation Model modes, with a greater proportion of adaptive responses to the VBAC than the previous cesarean. Information from Obstetricians, nurses, family members, and print media influenced women's decisions to attempt the vaginal birth. Most causes ascribed to the successful VBAC came from external sources, were particular to a given pregnancy, and were beyond the woman's control.
Conclusions
The women reported both positive and negative aspects of childbearing, regardless of mode of delivery. The results indicate a need for a high quality of nursing and obstetric care for all women, with an emphasis on relief of pain and the provision of support and information.",

How can a company become sustainably innovative? We propose that the company needs to have organizational forms that achieve a dynamic synthesis of knowledge exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we present the “dynamic fractal organization” as a new organizational model. This model departs from the conventional information processing paradigm. Instead, we present a new frontier in organizational theory: the “dynamic fractal organization based on dynamic ‘ba’.” Dynamic fractal organizations build and utilize a triad relationship of knowledge that integrates and synthesizes tacit and explicit knowledge and creates a third type of knowledge, phronesis. The triad relationship is an upward spiraling process of converting tacit and explicit knowledge, and propels sustainable knowledge transformation across the diverse boundaries within and between organizations, and their environments.",

abstract = "Tourist destinations as social-ecological systems face growing challenges to build resilience to cope with various disruptions. This research explores how disadvantaged Indigenous communities in Taiwan, especially those located in typhoon-sensitive and geologically fragile areas, developed resilience as tourist destinations. It applies empirical data from Indigenous River Closure, a movement which aims to develop river ecotourism and build resilience in the face of growing uncertainty. The research applies mixed methods, including in-depth interview, news-archive review, and participatory observation, with an intention for primary data and secondary data to complement one another. Based on the intertwined concepts of resilience, adaptability, transformability, and self-reorganization, the results show that River Closure initiated from within those communities (endogenous) seems to build greater resilience in ecotourism. At the same time, cases instigated by outsiders (exogenous) are not without potential to be successful, but there is a need to cautiously build consensus and increase capacity in the collaborative process with outside resources. The success of river ecotourism in a sensitive area depends on the level of social capital. It plays a key role in mobilizing community resources to adapt to uncertainty, reorganizing relations between the community and tourism development, and transforming River Closure from a community-based response to exploitation, to a robust Indigenous movement. However, while inherent social capital is proved to be a strong essence for community actions, it is becoming rare in modern society. Thus bolstering social capital is core to the exogenous approach for building resilience in the tourism sector.",

We review multivariate early warning and regime shift detection metrics, identify situations where various metrics will be most useful for rangeland science, and then highlight known shortcomings. Our review of a suite of multivariate-based regime shift/early warning indicators provides a broad range of metrics applicable to a wide variety of data types or contexts, from situations where a great deal is known about the key system drivers and a regime shift is hypothesized a priori, to situations where the key drivers and the possibility of a regime shift are both unknown.

Accordingly, numerous scholars have employed the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework as a tool for understanding how cities are evolving in times of profound global change. Focusing on the case of Kano, northern Nigeria's largest city, this paper explores the potential of the CHANS framework in the analysis and interpretation of the human–nature interface in cities of the global south. Drawing on the qualitative analysis of graphic information and classical and contemporary literature, the centuries-old spatial morphology of Kano is traced and analysed. In the process, the paper highlights how change in the roles of traditional institutions of urban land administration have triggered the degeneration of the city's resilient indigenous urban morphology. Field investigations and the analysis of a variety of 19th, 20th and, 21st century images reveal significant change in the city's traditional building materials, roofing styles, street forms, distribution of ponds, and green and open spaces. Population pressure on urban land has also been a major driving force behind the unfolding changes. One catastrophic outcome of these changes has been the exacerbation of recurrent floods. In drawing attention to wider lessons for urban planners in other developing country contexts, the paper stresses the need to analyse any notable spatial and non-spatial events in cities in relation to the changing dynamics of urban morphology.",

The paper establishes conceptual diversity in this emerging policy paradigm. Despite a common agenda for transformative change, there are notable differences concerning the understanding of the innovation process. Two global initiatives to promote such new innovation policies, Mission Innovation and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, are used to illustrate how different articulations of transformative innovation policy are expressed in practice. These may be seen as a positive expression of the breadth of the emerging policy paradigm. While there are grounds for such a positive reading, this paper ends with a caution by stressing the political nature of paradigm change and the strong legacy of an economic, firm-centred and technology-oriented tradition in innovation policy. It makes a plea for more emphasis on a broader conceptualization of transformative innovation, and suggests that a socio-technical understanding of innovation provides several appropriate analytical concepts that can help to shape our thinking and understanding of transformative innovation policy.",

To develop a framework for evaluating and monitoring a primary health care service, integrating hospital and community services.
Method
A targeted literature review of primary health service evaluation frameworks was performed to inform the development of the framework specifically for remote communities. Key principles underlying primary health care evaluation were determined and sentinel indicators developed to operationalise the evaluation framework. This framework was then validated with key stakeholders.
Results
The framework includes Donabedian's three seminal domains of structure, process and outcomes to determine health service performance. These in turn are dependent on sustainability, quality of patient care and the determinants of health to provide a comprehensive health service evaluation framework. The principles underpinning primary health service evaluation were pertinent to health services in remote contexts. Sentinel indicators were developed to fit the demographic characteristics and health needs of the population. Consultation with key stakeholders confirmed that the evaluation framework was applicable.
Conclusion
Data collected routinely by health services can be used to operationalise the proposed health service evaluation framework. Use of an evaluation framework which links policy and health service performance to health outcomes will assist health services to improve performance as part of a continuous quality improvement cycle.",

However, few studies have provided empirical support to the claimed benefits of mixed-use development and little is known about the process to achieve the desired benefits of mixed-use. This paper reports our investigation of three typical urban development models commonly used in China – “top-down” centrally-controlled development model, “bottom-up” individual-dominant development model, and “bottom-up” collective-dominant development model. Using Southern Changping of Beijing as a case study, where the mixed-use development has been adopted in the past decade, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the three approaches and assess the impacts of mixed-use on urban development in Beijing. By conducting questionnaire analysis and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the job-housing pattern, career development of residents, sense of community and community vitality of the three models, the paper discovers that the community under “bottom-up” collective-dominant development model effectively achieved mixed-use development, while the “top-down” centrally-controlled development may lead to functional division and the “bottom-up” individual-dominant developed community ended up in disorder and chaos. Our findings indicate that under current policy framework and development trends in China, the “bottom-up” collective-dominant development model and social inclusion would be an effective way to achieving the intended goals of the mixed-use development.",

This prototype represents the first step in building a shared knowledge based to support community resilience in multi-jurisdictional regional system. Vetted and endorsed by experienced practicing emergency managers in the county, the prototype system uses geospatial modeling to map resource allocation scenarios in relation to various types of risk in the region. By providing a trusted knowledge base of regional risks and resources, the prototype system can support emergency managers in developing an integrated perspective on shared regional risks and in collectively exploring, assessing, and improving the efficaciousness of coordinated inter-organizational and inter-jurisdictional resource allocation strategies in virtual emergency response and readiness scenarios.

abstract = "Metadata, such as the domain description and the purpose of an ontology, can be used to describe the context of ontologies for ontology integration. However, these metadata are not always available in ontologies. To solve the problem, a method is developed to automatically discern the domain of an ontology. This method uses a so-called core domain ontology, rules and an ontology reasoner to identify the domain. The core domain ontology is a light weight ontology that consists of the essential concepts of a domain. Rules and the ontology reasoner are used to test if the core domain ontology is consistent with an ontology for which the domain needs to be identified. If the two ontologies are not in violation, then the method confirms the consistency between them, that is, the test ontology shares the same domain as the core domain ontology. If the core domain ontology shows inconsistency with the test ontology, they do not share the same domain and then the ontology can be used to compare with another core domain ontology. Experiments on the core domain ontology for the conference domain show good results. Ten ontologies of mixed domains are compared with the core conference ontology. Eight ontologies’ domain are correctly identified, out of which, four ontologies are identified as sharing the same ontology domain.",

abstract = "Research on vulnerability and adaptation in social-ecological systems (SES) has largely centered on climate change and associated biophysical stressors. Key implications of this are twofold. First, there has been limited engagement with the impacts of social drivers of change on communities and linked SES. Second, the focus on climate effects often assumes slower drivers of change and fails to differentiate the implications of change occurring at different timescales. This has resulted in a body of SES scholarship that is under-theorized in terms of how communities experience and respond to fast versus slow change. Yet, social and economic processes at global scales increasingly emerge as ‘shocks’ for local systems, driving rapid and often surprising forms of change distinct from and yet interacting with the impacts of slow, ongoing ‘trends’. This research seeks to understand the nature and impacts of social shocks as opposed to or in concert with trends through the lens of a qualitative case study of a coastal community in Mexico, where demand from international seafood markets has spurred rapid development of a sea cucumber fishery. Specifically, we examined what different social-ecological changes are being experienced by the community, how the impacts of the sea cucumber fishery are distinct from and interacting with slower ongoing trends and how these processes are affecting system vulnerability, adaptations and adaptive capacity. We begin by proposing a novel framework for conceptualizing impacts on social systems, as comprised of structures, functions, and feedbacks. Our results illustrate how the rapid-onset of this fishery has driven dramatic changes in the community. New challenges such as the ‘gold-rush-style’ arrival of new actors, money, and livelihoods, the rapid over-exploitation of fish stocks, and increases in poaching and armed violence have emerged, exacerbating pressures from ongoing trends in immigration, overfishing and tourism development. We argue that there is a need to better understand and differentiate the social and ecological implications of shocks, which present novel challenges for the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of communities and the sustainability of marine ecosystems.",

The biophysical systems upon which we are totally dependent have not been challenged by human activities at the global scale before and our impacts upon those planetary systems, as well as upon our social systems, cannot be adequately addressed by ad hoc solutions. Science and leadership will be required to address this threat and transform our current societies into sustainable societies. This Special Volume presents an evolving, yet increasingly cohesive, science-based perspective on leadership towards sustainability. Examples of crucial, overall questions addressed by authors of articles in this Special Volume are: How can science help to clarify sustainability as a foundational platform for success for society's core institutions (e.g. business, governance and education), and how can this platform inform envisioning, planning, monitoring, communication and decision making to accelerate the needed transitions? The conceptual framing of sustainable development in this Special Volume is based upon the logic that it is only if we can define sustainability in a scientifically solid way, as a frame for any vision, that we can analyze current situations in relation to such sustainable visions, and design strategies to close the gap to such visions. In moving from current situations towards possible sustainable futures, specific support in the form of leadership concepts, methods, tools, and requirements are also essential, i.e. given clarity around what needs to be achieved, effective leadership then requires knowing how to achieve it. Both the what and the how questions are addressed in this Special Volume. The research described provides a foundation for moving from ad hoc activities to systemic, systematic and strategic transitions towards sustainability.",

A shift from a predominantly vertical to horizontal nutrient spiraling characterizes all three aquatic ecosystems, as does a reduction in the abundance of the larger (high-valued) fish stocks. Once the health of robust systems begins to decline, mechanisms are called into play that tend to perpetuate the ecosystem breakdown.

Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet.

abstract = "Prism adaptation has a long history as an experimental paradigm used to investigate the functional and neural processes that underlie sensorimotor control. In the neuropsychology literature, prism adaptation behaviour is typically explained by reference to a traditional cognitive psychology framework that distinguishes putative functions, such as 'strategic control' versus 'spatial realignment'. This theoretical framework lacks conceptual clarity, quantitative precision and explanatory power. Here, we advocate for an alternative computational framework that offers several advantages: 1) an algorithmic explanatory account of the computations and operations that drive behaviour; 2) expressed in quantitative mathematical terms; 3) embedded within a principled theoretical framework (Bayesian decision theory, state-space modelling); 4) that offers a means to generate and test quantitative behavioural predictions. This computational framework offers a route towards mechanistic neurocognitive explanations of prism adaptation behaviour. Thus it constitutes a conceptual advance compared to the traditional theoretical framework. In this paper, we illustrate how Bayesian decision theory and state-space models offer principled explanations for a range of behavioural phenomena in the field of prism adaptation (e.g. visual capture, magnitude of visual versus proprioceptive realignment, spontaneous recovery and dynamics of adaptation memory). We argue that this explanatory framework can advance understanding of the functional and neural mechanisms that implement prism adaptation behaviour, by enabling quantitative tests of hypotheses that go beyond merely descriptive mapping claims that ‘brain area X is (somehow) involved in psychological process Y’.",

The interconnections of trust and information exchange are examined in a survey of business relationships involving information exchange (n=355). Analysis of variance shows few, if any, of the aspects of the standard conceptualizations of information exchange are associated with increased levels of trust. It is information exchange norms that have the greatest (positive) association with the level of trust. These norms emerge as part of the long term co-production of the relationship itself. This has important managerial implications. We conclude there are few managerial actions involving managing communication that can “manufacture” trust and improve or develop relationships in the short term. The paper concludes with a discussion of alternative ways of envisaging communication and relationship management and the nature and future of research into the evolution of business relationships.",

abstract = "The aim of this work is to verify a theoretical representation of the multidimensional concept of territorial risk, through a study of Italian provinces. The concept is referred to the exposure of the territorial system to the risk of an exogenous event, as a combination of factors of fragility and resilience. In the proposed framework, elements of the organization of a territorial system had been identified, in its economic, social and environmental dimensions, mostly affecting his exposure to the adverse impact generated by a disturbing event and the ability to answer and to regenerate. According to this scheme of representation, the territorial risk is the result of the combination of these factors that influence the probability of a local system to undergo negative changes as a result of the occurrence of the event. The evaluation of vulnerability and resilience of a system, by adopting a holistic reading of the phenomenon, involves the identification of systemic components and attributes such as openness to the external environment, structural diversification, availability of resources, structural dependence/independence, functional redundancy, adaptability strategy. In the paper the authors propose the construction of an indicator system and composite indices for monitoring, through multivariate statistical techniques, the factors of fragility and ability to recovery. The proposed system is applied to a study of the economic, social and environmental vulnerability and resilience of the Italian provinces.",

Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.",

A mature understanding of sustainability management requires studies to adopt a multidisciplinary systemic lens capable of appreciating the interconnectivity of economic, political, social and ecological issues across temporal and spatial dimensions. Yet the field of systems thinking in the context of sustainability management research is disparate and can benefit from a comprehensive review in order to assimilate the current fragmented body of research and to identify promising research directions. To address this gap, we conducted a review of the systems thinking and sustainability management literature from 1990 up to 2015 including 96 articles. In this review, we first present descriptives that show an emerging body of work rapidly growing since 2011. We found that 54 percent of articles were published in two transdisciplinary journals, demonstrating that a systemic approach is not yet prevalent in mainstream management journals. Second, we identify and describe the core theoretical concepts of systems thinking found in the literature including interconnections, feedbacks, adaptive capacity, emergence and self-organization. Third, findings show a number of research themes, including behavioral change, leadership, innovation, industrial ecology, social-ecological systems, transitions management, paradigm shifts and sustainability education. Finally we offer a cross-scale integrated framework of our findings, and conclude by identifying a number of promising research opportunities.",

To build and test environmental management scenarios involves therefore complex conceptual problems, demanding appropriate conceptual tools as for example the Ecological Sustainability Trigon (EST). Conceptually, the EST allows addressing the referred main drivers by using the human society view as a common currency, and to describe our behavior, energetics (economy), and dynamics based on ecological theory. Besides, the EST behaves promisingly as a gap analysis tool and a mean to address new research questions.

This paper examines the current status of, and suggests some future directions for, research efforts in an area important for computer-integrated manufacturing: computer-aided process planning (CAPP). Rather than discuss a specific aspect of the subject or present details of a particular prototype system, the major emphasis is on the global perspectives of fundamental issues involved in developing computer-based planning systems for various manufacturing tasks. In reviewing the current research, references are made to technical papers presented at the 19th CIRP (International Institution for Production Engineering Research) International Seminar on Manufacturing Systems held at the Pennsylvania State University, June 1-2, 1987, with the major theme of Computer Aided Process Planning. In suggesting future directions, an integrated planning framework as a logical extension of current CAPP activities is proposed. The need for, and challenges of, such an integrated planning approach to manufacturing problems are summarized, and, specifically the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques within this framework are explained. The objective of this paper is to promote a better understanding of the nature and potential of manufacturing-related planning tasks by critiquing the present efforts with respect to the ultimate goals of unmanned production in the future.",

The primary results include enhanced situational awareness and improvements in fire control, engagement support, operational planning, combat reaction times, threat prioritization, and the list continues. Bettering the use of sensors and weapons in concert with one another–effectively creating a system of distributed systems–provides major payoffs. The effectiveness of managing distributed resources depends on the ability to make complex decisions [1]. The complexity is due in part to the circuitous nature of fusing data from multiple sensor sources to provide a representation of the operational environment from which to redirect sensors for further information optimization and from which to base military operations. The “goodness” of such complex decisions depends on the “goodness” of the information available and the understanding of the situation from a “big picture” perspective. This paper explores distributed resource management (RM) from a decision-based perspective. With an objective of enabling a collaborative system of systems (SoS), a systems approach is proposed to implement a decision paradigm that extends from system conception to operations.",

The need for an open architecture is stated, in order to allow users to modify decision criteria according to their experience, given that no skills are available yet to deal with real time strategy decision making. An architecture of knowledge is described that is oriented towards traffic management strategic advice applied in the TRYS system developed by the authors. This system has been installed for urban motorway control in several Spanish cities. Finally, an example of knowledge-based modeling, using TRYS, is presented in a case study where both the TRYS model and its operation are described.

abstract = "Measuring complexity is fast becoming a key instrument to compare different ecosystems at various scales in ecology. To date there has been little agreement on how to properly describe complexity in terms of ecology. In this regard, this manuscript assesses the significance of using a set of proposed measures based on information theory. These measures are as follows: emergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in the data analysis with the aim to apply these proposed measures. This study systematically reviews the data previously collected and generated by a model carried out on four aquatic ecosystems located between the Arctic region and the tropical zone. Thus, this research discusses the case of exploring a high level of self-organization in terms of movement, distribution, and quality of water between the northern temperate zone and the tropics. Moreover, it was assessed the significance of the presence of a complex variable (pH) in the middle of the latitudinal transect. Similarly, this study explores the relationship between self-organization and limiting nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicates). Furthermore, the importance of how a biomass subsystem is affected by seasonal variations is highlighted in this manuscript. This case study seeks to examine the changing nature of how seasonality affects the complexity dynamics of photosynthetic taxa (lakes located in northern temperate zone) at high latitudes, and it also investigates how a high level of self-organization at the tropical zone can lead to increase the amount of planktonic and benthic fish which determines the dynamics of complexity. This research also compares the emerging role of how a biomass subsystem has a highest temporal dynamics compared to he limiting nutrients’ subsystem. In the same way, the results associated to autopoiesis reflect a moderate degree of autonomy of photosynthetic biomass. It is also discussed the case of how complexity values change in the middle of the latitudinal gradient for all components. Finally, a comparison with Tsallis information was carried out in order to determine that these proposed measures are more suitable due to they are independent of any other parameter. Thus, this approach considers some elements closely related to information theory which determine and better describe ecological dynamics.",

Building on this literature review, we elaborate an analytical framework for studying organizational adaptivity. We apply the framework to a case study of the ArtesanalPesca fish producers organization from Sesimbra in Portugal in order to empirically explore the relative weight of the factors contained in the framework and the relations between them. The case outlined contains lessons on how adaptivity may help an organization to move towards a sustainable business model and how it may be an essential part of such a model.",

We propose “focal”, “very significant”, and “significant” variables, which allow us to define local context within the framework of PES programs. The proposed focal variables are a) forest cover, b) opportunity cost, c) livelihood and productive diversification, d) pro-social and pro-environmental motivations and attitudes, e) confidence and cooperation, f) traditional management practices, g) internal organization on the local level, h) land tenure, and i) rules for the management and use of natural resources.",

abstract = "Contemporary drug discovery and development (DDD) is dominated by a molecular target-based paradigm. Molecular targets that are potentially important in disease are physically characterized; chemical entities that interact with these targets are identified by ex vivo high-throughput screening assays, and optimized lead compounds enter testing as drugs. Contrary to highly publicized claims, the ascendance of this approach has in fact resulted in the lowest rate of new drug approvals in a generation. The primary explanation for low rates of new drugs is attrition, or the failure of candidates identified by molecular target-based methods to advance successfully through the DDD process. In this essay, I advance the thesis that this failure was predictable, based on modern principles of metabolic control that have emerged and been applied most forcefully in the field of metabolic engineering. These principles, such as the robustness of flux distributions, address connectivity relationships in complex metabolic networks and make it unlikely a priori that modulating most molecular targets will have predictable, beneficial functional outcomes. These same principles also suggest, however, that unexpected therapeutic actions will be common for agents that have any effect (i.e., that complexity can be exploited therapeutically). A potential operational solution (pathway-based DDD), based on observability rather than predictability, is described, focusing on emergent properties of key metabolic pathways in vivo. Recent examples of pathway-based DDD are described. In summary, the molecular target-based DDD paradigm is built on a naïve and misleading model of biologic control and is not heuristically adequate for advancing the mission of modern therapeutics. New approaches that take account of and are built on principles described by metabolic engineers are needed for the next generation of DDD.",

Since tracing a near-global-optimum embedded on a nonconvex search space can be viewed as a rare event problem, a CE algorithm constructed using a long-tailed distribution is intuitively attractive for effectively exploring the optimization landscape. Based on this supposition, a set of CE algorithms employing the Cauchy, logistic and Laplace distributions are experimentally validated in a wide range of optimization functions, which are shifted, rotated, expanded and/or composed, characterized by convex, unimodal, discontinuous, noisy and multimodal fitness landscapes. The Laplace distribution has been demonstrated to be more suitable for the CE optimization, since the samples drawn have jump-lengths long enough to elude local optima and short enough to preserve sufficient candidates in the global optimum neighborhood. Besides, a theoretical analysis has been carried out to understand the following: (i) benefits offered by the long-tailed distributions towards evasion of local optima; (ii) link between the variation in scale parameter estimate and the probability of producing candidate solutions arbitrarily close to the global optimum.",

For interpreting the huge variability of crop yield responses to increasing fertilizer applications, agronomists and soil scientists have focused on soil nutrient dynamics in order to estimate the quantity of each nutrient available for plant uptake. This linear approach considering “available nutrient in soil” as an external factor to which plants respond does not correspond to the reality for three main reasons: (i) the root absorption capacity is deeply feed-back controlled by the plant growth capacity itself and, therefore, does not depend univocally on soil nutrient availability; (ii) interactions among different nutrients in soils and plants imply that the availability of one nutrient for plants depends of the availability of others, requiring a more integrated approach; and (iii) the plant itself influences nutrient dynamic processes in soils through interactions with microbial communities in its rhizosphere. Consequently, soil nutrient availability cannot be only considered as a property of the external medium to which plants adapt, but also, and more importantly, as resulting of the functioning of the whole plant-soil-living organisms ecosystem. This review paper proposes an integrated and hypothesis-based vision of plant mineral nutrition based on several recent findings: (i) the corroboration and verification of hypotheses of regulation of plant nutrient uptake at the whole plant level by recent advances in the molecular physiology of plant nutrition, (ii) the physiological basis for interactions among different plant nutrients, and (iii) the increasing evidence of plant-soil interactions at the rhizosphere level.",

One attempt at such framework began over 25 years ago and is now widely known as the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development. However, as with the larger sustainability field, the social dimension of this framework has been found to not be sufficiently science-based and operational and thus in need of further development. In this two-part series an attempt at a science-based, operational definition of social sustainability is presented. In part 1 a systems-based approach to the social system was presented, based on extensive literature studies as well as conceptual modelling sessions using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development as the guiding structure. The focus of that study was on the essential aspects of the social system that need to be sustained, namely trust, common meaning, diversity, capacity for learning and capacity for self-organization. The aim of this second paper is to identify and present overriding mechanisms by which these aspects of the social system can be degraded, thereby finding exclusion criteria for re-design for sustainability. Further literature studies, conceptual modelling sessions and initial testing of this prototype with partners in academia, business and NGOs were performed. Based on the understanding of the essential aspects of the social system and the identified overriding mechanisms of degradation of these, a hypothesis for a definition of social sustainability by basic principles is presented. The proposed principles are that in a socially sustainable society, people are not subject to structural obstacles to: (1) health, (2) influence, (3) competence, (4) impartiality and (5) meaning-making. Overall, the two papers aim to provide a hypothesis for a definition of social sustainability, which is general enough to be applied irrespective of spatial and temporal constraints, but concrete enough to guide decision-making and monitoring. It is also a further development of the social dimension of the FSSD, which practitioners and researchers have requested for some time and can act as a support towards better integration of social sustainability in many other fields, e.g., sustainable product innovation, sustainable supply chain management, sustainable transport system development, and others.",

To address this concern, first, we conceptualize the leadership emergence process from a complexity perspective and define emergence as a dynamic, interactive process grounded in three principles of emergent phenomena. Second, we review how previous research has modeled leadership emergence by focusing on the content areas of the lower-level elements, the mechanisms that facilitate their emergence, and the dynamism of the process once it has emerged. Third, based on the findings from the review, we introduce a process-oriented framework of leadership emergence. Fourth, we offer propositions to guide developing and testing emergent leadership processes, and we conclude with recommendations for future leadership process research. Our hope is that by realigning the study of leadership emergence with complexity and multilevel theory, we can reorient this area to focusing more on the process mechanisms within emergence, connecting back to research progress made over 60 years ago.",

Those adjustments became necessary to facilitate second order learning and agreements on required structural changes among a large number of participants. This case study contributes to the soft OR and strategy literature with insights about the promise and constraints of this soft OR methodology to collectively structure complex decisions that support organizational redesign and strategy implementation.",

This research deals with mechanisms shaping emerging patterns, including the rise of a land market, settlement of inner suburbs by urban core and “floating” populations, and peri-urban in-filling. Growth drivers flow from planning and targeting high technology manufacturing based on domestic research and development, foreign companies, and joint ventures as well as new sources of domestic capital based on property development schemes and cooperation between Party cadres and local entrepreneurs. Evidence comes from the 2000 Census, remotely sensed photography, and interviews with city planners. The match between new residential and occupational spaces and transportation infrastructure connections for a more mobile and spatially diffuse population is of concern for future policy.",

Within this context, as economic geographers, our concern in this paper is with the usefulness of the idea of emergence for studying the economic landscape and its evolution. The paper considers in what sense geographical processes and places can legitimately be described as emergent, how such places themselves produce emergent effects, and how we should conceive of and study the ‘emergent’ space economy. To do this, we apply Deacon's (2006) models of first-order, second-order and third-order emergence, and trace through their implications for constructing an ‘emergence perspective’ in economic geography. The notion of third-order emergence is argued to be the most promising, since it focuses explicitly on emergence as an evolutionary process. What is evident, however, is that a notion developed mainly for applications in physical and biological systems requires further elaboration and exploration if it is to provide explanatory leverage in studying the evolution of economic landscapes.",

abstract = "How does the brain learn to recognize an object from multiple viewpoints while scanning a scene with eye movements? How does the brain avoid the problem of erroneously classifying parts of different objects together? How are attention and eye movements intelligently coordinated to facilitate object learning? A neural model provides a unified mechanistic explanation of how spatial and object attention work together to search a scene and learn what is in it. The ARTSCAN model predicts how an object’s surface representation generates a form-fitting distribution of spatial attention, or “attentional shroud”. All surface representations dynamically compete for spatial attention to form a shroud. The winning shroud persists during active scanning of the object. The shroud maintains sustained activity of an emerging view-invariant category representation while multiple view-specific category representations are learned and are linked through associative learning to the view-invariant object category. The shroud also helps to restrict scanning eye movements to salient features on the attended object. Object attention plays a role in controlling and stabilizing the learning of view-specific object categories. Spatial attention hereby coordinates the deployment of object attention during object category learning. Shroud collapse releases a reset signal that inhibits the active view-invariant category in the What cortical processing stream. Then a new shroud, corresponding to a different object, forms in the Where cortical processing stream, and search using attention shifts and eye movements continues to learn new objects throughout a scene. The model mechanistically clarifies basic properties of attention shifts (engage, move, disengage) and inhibition of return. It simulates human reaction time data about object-based spatial attention shifts, and learns with 98.1% accuracy and a compression of 430 on a letter database whose letters vary in size, position, and orientation. The model provides a powerful framework for unifying many data about spatial and object attention, and their interactions during perception, cognition, and action.",

In contemporary cognitive science, there are two distinct paradigms with contrasting definitions of cognition. The computational theory of mind is based on the syntaxical manipulation of symbolic representations; this paradigm is objectivist because the postulate of a unique independent reality is necessary as a referential basis for semantic grounding of the symbols. The alternative ‘constructivist’ paradigm is based on the biological metaphor ‘cognition = life’ and programmatically follows the evolution of cognition from bacteria to civilized humans; it is non-objectivist. There is a definite tendency to consider that the computational theory is appropriate for ‘high-level’ human cognition, whereas the constructivist approach is appropriate for ‘low-level’ cognition. This article argues against such a division of labour, since the issue of objectivism is a watershed which continues to demarcate the computational and constructivist paradigms in their respective approaches to higher-level cognition.",

abstract = "Behavioural strategy deals with strategic management from a psychologically informed perspective, integrating emotional aspects in strategic management. Strategic situations can be characterised by a high level of uncertainty, based on the unforeseeable nature of the future and the paradoxical nature of underlying seemingly conflicting choices. Both entail human emotional reactions such as fear and anxiety. Therefore, the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities theory should pay more attention on the study of fear in the strategic decision-making process. Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have long-term experience in researching these emotions, such that psychodynamic theory can help with understanding their influences on the thoughts and feelings of the manager, the management team, and the organisation in the process of strategy making. Using the psychodynamic lens in the field of behavioural strategy presents a new and fairly neglected avenue for exploring the more unconscious, ‘deep foundations’ of dynamic capabilities resting on the strategizing manager, the top decision-making team, and the implementing organisation. The three generic dynamic capabilities developed by Teece et al. (1997) and Teece (2007), sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, provide a framework for developing a process-oriented perspective for creating corporate strategy, so that the foundations of dynamic capabilities can be reworked and complemented within this framework. This will also enable the operationalisation of success factors for dynamic capabilities from a psychodynamic perspective and creates opportunities for future research.",

The paper discusses the shortcomings found in the IVHM field, particularly in the area of vehicle level health monitoring and how reasoning can be applied to address some of them.

Traditionally, localized treatment has targeted the cancer cells directly by removing them (surgery) or killing them (chemotherapy and radiation). These modes of therapy have not always been effective because many tumors recur after these therapies, either because not all of the cells are killed (local recurrence) or because the cancer cells had already escaped the primary tumor environment (distant recurrence). There has been an increasing recognition that the tumor microenvironment contains host noncancer cells in addition to cancer cells, interacting in a dynamic fashion over time. The cancer cells compete and/or cooperate with nontumor cells, and the cancer cells may compete and/or cooperate with each other. It has been demonstrated that these interactions can alter the genotype and phenotype of the host cells as well as the cancer cells. The interaction of these cancer and host cells to remodel the normal host organ microenvironment may best be conceptualized as an evolving ecosystem. In classic terms, an ecosystem describes the physical and biological components of an environment in relation to each other as a unit. Here, we review some properties of tumor microenvironments and ecological systems and indicate similarities between them. We propose that describing tumors as ecological systems defines new opportunities for novel cancer therapies and use the development of prostate cancer metastases as an example. We refer to this as “ecological therapy” for cancer.",

abstract = "Artificial immune systems (AIS) constitute a relatively new area of bio-inspired computing. Biological models of the natural immune system, in particular the theories of clonal selection, immune networks and negative selection, have provided the inspiration for AIS algorithms. Moreover, such algorithms have been successfully employed in a wide variety of different application areas. However, despite these practical successes, until recently there has been a dearth of theory to justify their use. In this paper, the existing theoretical work on AIS is reviewed. After the presentation of a simple example of each of the three main types of AIS algorithm (that is, clonal selection, immune network and negative selection algorithms respectively), details of the theoretical analysis for each of these types are given. Some of the future challenges in this area are also highlighted.",

Brick and Zames showed how Wiener's expansion procedure could be used to synthesize decision functions for stochastic inputs. In this chapter, it is accomplished by adopting Ashby's approach to intelligence. Thus creativity, planning, induction, and hypothesis generation are features, which will not specifically be a concern for the present model of the automaton. However, generalization of existing hypotheses arid selection, recognition and learning with respect to these are major factors in the present chapter. The model of the recognition system derived here is, in fact, a form of conditional probability computer, which operates on stochastic processes. Of major interest is the fact that this procedure appears to avoid the tendency toward exponential growth normally considered to be characteristic of conditional probability computers. The narrowing-down of the artificial intelligence problem to the recognition, learning, and prediction phases, however one proceeds to justify it, is not without precedence.",

In the last few decades, however, advances in non-equilibrium thermodynamics (i.e., self-organizing, open, dissipative, far-from-equilibrium systems), and nonlinear dynamics, network science, information theory, and other mathematical approaches to complex systems have produced a new set of concepts and methods, which are powerful for understanding and predicting behavior in socio-economic systems. In several previous papers, for example, we used research from the new Energy Network Science (ENS) to show how and why systemic ecological and economic health requires a balance of efficiency and resilience be maintained within a particular a “window of vitality”. The current paper outlines the logic behind 10 principles of systemic, socio-economic health and the quantitative measures that go with them. Our particular focus is on “regenerative aspects”, i.e., the self-feeding, self-renewal, and adaptive learning processes that natural systems use to nourish their capacity to thrive for long periods of time. In socio-economic systems, we demonstrate how regenerative economics requires regular investment in human, social, natural, and physical capital. Taken as a whole, we propose these 10 metrics represent a new capacity to understand, and set better policy for solving, the entangled systemic suite of social, environmental, and economic problems now faced in industrial cultures.",

abstract = "Soils are one of the most important features of the natural capital of terrestrial ecosystems. There is a strong and increasing policy requirement for effective monitoring of soils at local, regional and national-scales. However, it remains unclear which properties of soils are most appropriately monitored. This is partly due to the wide range of goods and services that soils provide, but also their inherent chemical, physical and biological complexity. Given that the biota plays such fundamental roles in the majority of ecosystem services provided by soils, biological properties are logical candidates as effective indicators, to complement soil physico-chemical properties. A plethora of biological methods have been suggested as indicators for monitoring soils but few are used in national-scale monitoring or are published as international standards. A framework for selecting ecologically relevant biological indicators of soil quality, for national-scale soil monitoring, that cover the range of functions and services of soil was devised. The literature was surveyed to identify 183 candidate biological indicators which were then scored by experts and stakeholders against a wide range of scientific and technical criteria. The framework used the scores and weightings to then rank, prioritise and select the indicators. This semi-objective approach using a “logical sieve” allowed repeated iterations to take account of end-user requirements and expert opinion. A ranked list of 21 indicators was produced that covered a range of genotypic-, phenotypic- and functional-based indicators for different trophic groups. Four of these were not deemed sufficiently robust for ready deployment in a national-scale monitoring scheme without further methodological development. The suite of indicators identified offers the strongest potential candidates for deployment in national-scale soil monitoring schemes. However, standard operating procedures, their inherent sensitivity, ability to discriminate between soil:land use combinations, ecological interpretation all need to be confirmed. The power of the approach adopted here is that it provides a clear record and audit trail on the decision-making process, enables different priorities to be set contingent on the nature of the desired monitoring, and can direct and allow the inclusion of further methods or indicators into the framework.",

Its applications are everywhere, supporting users in everyday activities in a transparent way with little or no need for attention. To ensure the adoption of these applications, it is essential to assess the quality of the interaction with its users. To do that, measurements can be applied to obtain data about quality characteristics in a software product. In a previous study about quality characteristics and software measures for ubiquitous computing, we have identified a gap in the literature regarding software measures for evaluating essential quality characteristics in ubiquitous systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a suite of well-defined software measures (twenty-four in total), called AQUArIUM, to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) in ubiquitous applications for mobile devices. These measures address five quality characteristics of ubiquitous computing: Context-awareness, Mobility, Attention, Calmness and Transparency. The proposed suite was validated theoretically and empirically. The results showed not only that the suite is feasible, but also that it indicates specific problems of HCI quality, which are helpful in improving the evaluated ubiquitous mobile application.",

Board games provide one avenue by which archaeologists may examine the ways in which people interacted. The act of play is liminoid, allowing for people to more easily overcome social boundaries to interaction, while also creating a shared experience for the process of grounding. Thus, games provide an opportunity for people to build relationships and also to negotiate their identity. This research counters previous assertions that only complex societies play strategy games. In Bronze Age Cyprus, middle-range society became increasingly complex with the development of urbanism and differential access to wealth, while also producing a particularly large corpus of ancient board games. Determining where games were played, and then analyzing the social context of games in those spaces using multiple correspondence analysis, it was found that people were more likely to be playing in public during periods of greater complexity. This is likely due to the performative aspects of play, allowing for the communication of status in different ways when games are played in public spaces. The pattern found shows the variation in the ways people incorporated games into their social strategies during periods of different types of complexity.",

abstract = "This paper presents a method called the Short Term Protection (STP) which is applied to fixed networks where flows1 are constrained to follow specific routes, where the admission-process is distributed, per-route, and where the traffic is sensitive to delay (like MPEG4 traffic). The share of bandwidth of any route is protected, in the short-term, against the traffic-increment of its intersecting-routes. In the long term, in every congested link, the share of bandwidth between the routes that intersect at that link is proportional to the average relative measured demands of those routes. The nodes act autonomously, without central administration. This method is expected to: 1) help network administrators to have confidence, within a time-frame, about the amount of bandwidth they count on for every route; 2) allow a simple bandwidth management in the network, with prospect to be scalable to at least tens of nodes. This paper presents the general and detailed operation of the method, the evaluation of the method, by simulations, including a comparison with other method, a discussion of a possible scenario of application, conclusions and possible paths for further research.
Resumen
Este artículo presenta un método llamado short term protection -STP- (Protección a Corto Plazo) que se aplica a redes fijas donde los flujos11A flow is a sequence of related packets that enter a network through the same source-node and leave the network through the same egress-node. están restringidos a seguir rutas específicas, donde el proceso de admisión es distribuido, por ruta, y donde el tráfico es sensible a retrasos (como el tráfico MPEG4). La porción de ancho de banda de cada ruta está protegida, en el corto plazo, contra incremento de tráfico en rutas de intersección. En el largo plazo, en cada enlace congestionado, la proporción de ancho de banda entre las rutas que se interceptan en ese enlace es proporcional a las demandas relativas promedio medidas de esas rutas. Los nodos actúan de manera autónoma, sin administración central. Se espera que este método: 1) Ayude a los administradores de la red a tener confianza, por un periodo de tiempo, acerca de la cantidad de ancho de banda con la que cuentan para cada ruta; 2) Permita una administración simple en la red, con prospecto de ser escalable hacia al menos decenas de nodos. Este artículo presenta la operación general y detallada del método, la evaluación del método, por simulaciones, incluyendo una comparación con otro método, un diálogo sobre un posible escenario de aplicación, conclusiones y posibles rutas para investigación futura.",

Our fieldwork and interviews in Ambovombe subprefecture in Androy addressed land use, agropastoralism, livelihood, institutions and their moral basis. Our analysis points to the interdependence of cultural practices and ecosystem services: sacred forests, crop pollination, subsistence farming, cattle economy and societal transition and purification rituals. We posit a social-ancestral contract that works as a moral attractor structuring and sustaining the agropastoral ecosystem services system. The contract between living and nonliving clan members underpins the cultural practices and rituals that regulate the vulnerable agropastoral system. We conclude that the well-being values of the inhabitants of the south of Madagascar depend upon moralities that lend legitimacy and stability to the management of the social–ecological processes that precondition ecosystem services production. Neither ecosystem nor culture delivers ecosystem services to society. Ecosystem services are generated by an interdependent social–ecological system in which knowledge, practice, and beliefs coevolve: culture is a key factor in their generation and persistence. The study suggests these are significant interdependences to consider in dynamic analyses of ecosystem service production.",

abstract = "Background
Prenatal maternal stress might be a risk for the developing fetus and may have long-lasting effects on child and adult vulnerability to somatic and psychiatric disease. Over-exposure of the unborn to excess glucocorticoids and subsequent alteration of fetal development is hypothesized to be one of the key mechanisms linking prenatal stress with negative child outcome.
Methods
In this prospective longitudinal study, mothers-to-be (n = 405) in late pregnancy (36.8 ± 1.9 weeks of gestational age) and their singleton neonates were studied. We investigated the impact of different prenatal stress indices derived from six stress variables (perceived stress, specific prenatal worries, negative life events, symptoms of depression, trait anxiety, neuroticism) and diurnal maternal saliva cortisol secretion on gestational age and anthropometric measures at birth.
Results
Maternal prenatal distress during late gestation was associated with significant reduction in birth weight (−217 g; p = .005), birth length (−1.2 cm; p = .005) and head circumference (−0.8 cm; p = .001). Prenatal stress was modestly but significantly associated with altered diurnal cortisol pattern (flattened cortisol decline and higher evening cortisol), which in turn was significantly related to reduced length of gestation. No evidence for a profound interaction between maternal cortisol level in late pregnancy and infant’s anthropometric measures at birth (i.e., birth weight, length, head circumference) was found.
Conclusion
Prenatal stress is associated with flattened circadian saliva cortisol profiles and reduced infant’s anthropometric measures at birth. HPA system activity during pregnancy may be related to low gestational age. The effect of prenatal stress might be partly mediated by maternal-placental-fetal neuroendocrine mechanisms especially the dysregulation of diurnal cortisol profile.",

When feedback control is extended to the metal cutting process itself, there has been an unfortunate tendency to call such systems adaptive controls, for example, adaptive control constraint (ACC) and adaptive control optimization (ACO), even though they have not been adaptive in the sense of modern control theory. A special name, parameter adaptive control, has been proposed to describe the application of truly adaptive control to metal cutting. Even though there is substantial work on adaptive control within the body of modern control theory, there have been few reductions of parameter adaptive control to actual machine tools. It has been suggested that the primary impediments to such application are the lack of mathematical models of manufacturing processes in forms appropriate to the control problem, and the lack of in-process sensing techniques that would be complementary to such models. This paper describes one step in a sequence of research efforts that is intended to lead to the adaptive control of unattended machine tools. Numerical parameters are used to evaluate coefficients of a previously developed state space model of semi-orthogonal metal cutting on a lathe. An Advanced Continuous Simulation Language (ACSL) program is presented.",

abstract = "Setting priorities for health services is a complex and value laden process. Over the past twenty years, there has been considerable scholarly attention paid to strengthening fairness and legitimacy using the prominent ethical framework, Accountability for Reasonableness (A4R). A variety of case studies applying A4R have advanced our conceptual understanding of procedural fairness, and have highlighted the significance of context through its application. There is a paucity of research, however, that rigorously examines how and to what extent context influences health priority setting processes and the establishment of procedural fairness. We argue here that to study context rigorously requires taking a holistic view of the system by examining the dynamics and interrelationships within it. Using the Transformative Systems Change Framework (TSCF), this investigation sought to examine the influence of system factors on priority setting practice and procedural fairness. A qualitative case study of Ethiopian district health planning was undertaken in 2010 and 2011. Methods included 58 qualitative interviews with decision makers, participant observation, and document analysis. Data analysis followed in three phases: i) an inductive analysis of district health priority setting to highlight experiences across each of the three districts selected, ii) deductive analysis applying A4R and the TSCF independently; and iii) a synthesis of concepts of priority setting practice and procedural fairness within a broader, theoretical understanding of the system. Through the application of the TSCF, a nuanced understanding of priority setting practice is revealed that situates this process within a system of interdependent components that include: norms, operations, regulations, and resources. This paper offers a practical guide attuned to system features influencing the design, implementation, and sustainability of greater fairness in health priority setting practice.",

This societal transformation will involve all aspects of society co-evolving toward and aligning with sustainability goals and is defined as sustainability transition or system innovation for sustainability. However, neither the theory nor the operational approaches currently based on this emerging theory address how to link macro-level innovation within society to the micro-level innovation by companies. This paper presents a scenario method developed and tested for the use of product development teams. The scenario method uses both explorative and backcasting scenarios to link activities/decisions at the product development (micro-innovation) level in companies with the transformation which needs to take place at the societal (macro-innovation) level to achieve sustainability. Workshops were used to develop scenario maps for innovation pathways, leading to sustainable future visions. The method was evaluated by carrying out expert consultations and workshops with product development teams. The evaluation results demonstrated that the scenario method is a viable method to aid companies in aligning their innovation efforts with short, medium and long-term sustainability requirements and identified outstanding issues for further development of the scenario method.",

This paper presents a developmental timeline to critically consider institutional responses to coastal development and seeks to locate contemporary challenges, such as climate change, in the context of a new environmental determinism. The argument is put forward that securing a shared understanding of development conditions and risks needs to be predicated on creating more robust conditions for interaction and fostering a sounder appreciation of the inter-dependencies of natural processes and governance. The concept of resilience is critically explored in order to consider a normative analytical framework for facilitating social learning and developing a reciprocal understanding of social–ecological dynamics that offers a spectrum of resilience options.

abstract = "Background
Studies exploring the relations between maternal stress and fetal development show an association between increased maternal stress and adverse birth outcomes. A frequently proposed mechanism linking maternal prenatal stress and adverse birth outcomes is heightened concentrations of maternal cortisol. To date, studies exploring this association have reported conflicting results because of the diverse approaches taken to measuring cortisol and the wide variety of possible birth outcomes explored. To add clarity to the growing body of literature, this systematic review and meta-analysis reports empirical findings on the association between maternal prenatal salivary cortisol and newborn birth weight.
Methods
Searches for relevant papers published up until November 2017 were run in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Non-English language papers were included and experts were contacted when necessary. We included data from human observational studies that were designed or had an underlying intention to measure maternal prenatal salivary cortisol and newborn birth weight. We only included data from measurements of salivary cortisol to prevent rendering of the review unsuitable for meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and quality. For every maternal-fetal dyad, an area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) of maternal cortisol was calculated to determine a Pearson’s correlation coefficient with a continuous measure of newborn birth weight. Correlation coefficients were then pooled across all stages of gestation. To examine if there are critical gestational periods in which the fetus may be more susceptible to elevated concentration of maternal salivary cortisol, a meta-analysis was performed on separate correlations calculated from gestational trimesters.
Results
Nine studies with a total of 1606 maternal-fetal dyads demonstrated a negative correlation between pooled maternal salivary cortisol and birth weight (−0.24, 95% CI −0.28 to −0.20), but there was a high degree of heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 88.9%). To investigate heterogeneity, subgroup analysis by trimester of the pooled correlation between salivary cortisol and birth weight was performed with the following correlations found: first trimester, −0.18 (95% CI −0.32 to −0.03, I2 = 97.3%); second trimester, −0.20 (95% CI −0.28 to −0.12, I2 = 98.3%); and third trimester, −0.30 (95% CI −0.33 to −0.26, I2 = 85.4%).
Discussion
A consistently negative association was observed between maternal cortisol and infant birth weight. The review highlights specific gaps in the literature on the relationship between maternal prenatal salivary cortisol and newborn birth weight. Although a significant negative correlation was found, substantial heterogeneity of effects and the likelihood of publication bias exist. The third trimester was revealed as a possible critical gestational period for heightened maternal cortisol concentration to affect birth weight. Challenges faced in this body of research and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

We also propose DEA/SIR ratio as ecosystem attribute able to describe the state of an ecosystem and to reflect changes in ecological processes. With this purpose, we measured SIR, DEA and DEA/SIR ratio in five gold-mining areas and five surrounding natural reference rainforests. We also measured indicators in two conditions of spontaneous regeneration of vegetation (stratified or not) and two conditions of soil rehabilitation (prior preparation of soils or not). We showed a high variability of DEA, SIR and DEA/SIR ratio in the natural reference forests. This pointed out the necessity to identify relevant reference systems – i.e. proving a close match in all relevant ecological dimensions – to compare with closed perturbed systems in order to assess the levels of alterations after disturbances. Results showed a high impact of gold mine on microbial processes with a strong decrease of DEA (10-fold lower), SIR (2-fold lower) and DEA/SIR ratio (8-fold lower) in perturbed areas in comparison with natural reference forests. The type of spontaneous vegetation (stratified or not) influenced the values of indicators as well as prior rehabilitation of soils, demonstrating the capacity of DEA, SIR and DEA/SIR ratio to respond in proportion to the perturbation (robustness) and to the different levels of restoration (sensitivity). The systematic decrease of the ratio DEA/SIR observed in the studied perturbed situations demonstrates clearly that the structure of microbial communities has been also modified. The ratio DEA/SIR proved to be robust and sensitive, and able to describe in fairly fine way changes of soil microbial communities in terms of structure and function in gold mine areas and during processes of restoration. We propose to use DEA, SIR and DEA/SIR ratio as bioindicators of both structural and functional aspects of C and N cycling in soils. Together with others bioindicators based on key supporting functions in soils, these indicators should accurately evaluate the ecological potential of natural ecosystems and the levels of degradation in case of land-use changes.",

This study incorporates the concept of partial reinforcement learning into trading agents and finds that they have two learning components: learning from a dynamic market change and learning from collaboration with other traders. The learning speed of traders becomes slow when a large fluctuation occurs in the power exchange market. The learning speed depends upon the type of traders, their learning capabilities and the fluctuation of market fundamentals.

abstract = "A conceptual perspective is introduced which appears to convey substantial explanatory power with respect to some prominent current issues in fisheries ecology, including evident regime shifts in resource productivity and/or in species dominance. Underpinning the proposed perspective are two key ideas. These are the ‘school trap’ concept and the notion of ‘affinities’ to specific ocean features or locations that may characterize individual fish. These two ideas lead to a mechanism, here termed ‘school-mix feedback’, by which mobile fish populations may automatically track low frequency environmental and ecosystem variability and make particularly rapid adaptive adjustments of behaviors and migratory tendencies to the associated changes in conditions. However the mechanism also appears to involve the possibility that a fish population could thereby fall into a short-period analog to an evolutionary feedback trap, from which it may not easily extricate itself without undergoing population collapse. Analogous adaptive responses to geographically-biased fishery exploitation may upset the integrity of naturally-evolved systems and potentially lead to chronic suppression of resource productivity. Possibilities for innovative adaptive management actions are suggested. Both heuristic and real explanatory examples are cited, in most cases dealing with pelagic fish stocks and upwelling ecosystems.",

abstract = "The role of management of technology in the context of achieving competitiveness and development has become a matter of global interest. One of the problems hindering effective management of technology is the tendency to treat technology as a “black box.” For the effective management of technology it is imperative that a clear and practical working definition of technology is first established. This paper is attempt to meet this need and initially traces the various perspectives that have, over time, shaped the various definitions of technology that are currently in use. It is pointed out that the four-component definition of technology — technoware, humanware, inforware, and orgaware—that fall under the “technology as embodiment forms” perspective appears to have the most value in terms of opening up the “technology black box.” An indepth explanation of the nature and structure of the four components of technology, in the context of manufacturing technology, is provided along with further elaborations to help operationalize the concept of the four components. A revised and more detailed definition of the four components of manufacturing technology is then arrived at. The term polytrophic is used by bacteriologists to refer to organisms that derive nourishment from more than one source. It is pointed out that the four components of technology display polytrophic properties because of their ability to develop through their interaction with one another. The proposed detailed definition is thus referred to as the “polytrophic” components of technology. It is pointed out that the “polytrophic” components of technology definition can be used to obtain fresh insights into technological sophistication, technology content of production activities, technology transfer, and technology capability development. Its usefulness in examining the scope of different technology transfer mechanisms is briefly outlined.",

The implication for suppliers is that they need to consider which relationships offer them better value and then allocate resources towards those relationships, which in this case are their business customers. The implication for government procurement managers is that their methods of dealing with suppliers is putting them at a disadvantage when compared with businesses which may be competing for supply.",

abstract = "In recent years, the threat of global climate change, high fuel import dependence, and rapidly rising electricity demand levels have intensified the quest for more sustainable energy systems. This in turn has increased the need for policy makers to promote electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Guaranteed prices coupled with a buy-back obligation for electricity fed into the grid is a popular renewables promotion instrument, especially in Europe. More recently, driven mainly by electricity market liberalisation efforts, quota targets for the share of renewables in combination with tradable ‘green’ certificates (TGC) have received considerable attention. TGC offer a greater theoretical potential for economic efficiency gains, due to price competition and the greater flexibility assigned to the obliged parties. While guaranteed prices and TGC schemes support the operation of renewable energy technology systems, bidding schemes for renewable energy generation capacity are used to raise economic efficiency on the plant construction side. All of these policy instruments suffer from the shortcoming that they do not explicitly account for the often widely varying environmental, social and economic impacts of the technologies concerned. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the design of renewable energy policy instruments that is based on integrated assessment. In particular, we argue that using participatory multicriteria evaluation as part of the design of renewable energy promotion policies would make it possible: (1) to differentiate the level of promotion in a systematic and transparent manner according to their socio-ecological economic impact, and (2) to explicitly account for the preferences of stakeholders. A further problem of existing TGC and bidding schemes is that diversity of supply could be severely diminished, if few low-cost technologies were allowed to dominate the renewable energy market. To ensure a certain diversity of technologies, our scheme suggests the use of different technology bands for technologies that are relatively homogeneous with respect to their maturity.",

An analysis of three case studies reveals that the GSE is becoming ever more vulnerable to systemic changes that will have serious consequences for the environment and society alike.

However, due to their ever-increasing energy demand which causes large energy bills and CO2 emissions, over the past six years the focus has shifted towards energy-performance aware. The average energy consumption of servers is increasing continuously; and several researchers suggest, if this trend continues further, the cost of energy consumed by a server during its lifetime will exceed the hardware costs. The energy consumption problem is even greater for large-scale infrastructures, such as clusters, grids and clouds, which consist of several thousand heterogeneous servers. Efforts are continuously made to minimize the energy consumption of these systems, but the interest of people in computational services and popularity of smart devices make it a difficult task. In this paper, we discuss the energy consumption of ICT equipment, and present a taxonomy of energy and performance efficient techniques for large computing systems covering clusters, grids and clouds (datacenters). We discuss both energy and performance efficiency, which makes this survey different from those already published in the literature. Key research papers are surveyed and mapped onto taxonomies to characterise and identify outstanding and key issues for further research. We discuss several state-of-the-art resource management techniques, reported in the literature, that claim significant improvement in the energy efficiency and performance of ICT equipment and large-scale computing systems such as datacenters, and identify a few open challenges.",

Implementing a servitization strategy increases environmental complexity because of the growth in the number of interrelations and interactions of the activities taking place in the service processes, as well as interorganizational and intraorganizational relationships between the different actors. Platform has been identified as an organizational paradigm which may have potential to support companies in managing the increased complexity. However, studies about platform approaches with this focus are limited. Therefore, this study links the theoretical knowledge on complexity management with that of platforms, revealing the potentialities of platforms in managing complexity in service business context. Furthermore, based on the empirical findings from two case companies, the paper elaborates the mechanisms through which platforms can help companies to manage complexity through reducing and absorbing it.",

The intent of this paper is in the examination of health IT implementation processes – the barriers to and facilitators of successful implementation, identification of a beginning set of implementation best practices, the identification of gaps in the health IT implementation body of knowledge, and recommendations for future study and application.
Methods
A literature review resulted in the identification of six health IT related implementation best practices which were subsequently debated and clarified by participants attending the NI2012 Research Post Conference held in Montreal in the summer of 2012. Using the framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide their application, the six best practices were applied to two distinct health IT implementation studies to assess their applicability.
Results
Assessing the implementation processes from two markedly diverse settings illustrated both the challenges and potentials of using standardized implementation processes. In support of what was discovered in the review of the literature, “one size fits all” in health IT implementation is a fallacy, particularly when global diversity is added into the mix. At the same time, several frameworks show promise for use as “scaffolding” to begin to assess best practices, their distinct dimensions, and their applicability for use.
Conclusions
Health IT innovations, regardless of the implementation setting, requires a close assessment of many dimensions. While there is no “one size fits all”, there are commonalities and best practices that can be blended, adapted, and utilized to improve the process of implementation. This paper examines health IT implementation processes and identifies a beginning set of implementation best practices, which could begin to address gaps in the health IT implementation body of knowledge.",

Socially embedded agents are structurally coupled with their social environment, in that their sensorimotor activity is grounded in the social environment that the agent is surrounded by. Lastly, based on research in the social sciences on human–human interaction, we discuss perceptual requirements for interaction-aware robotic agents—agents whose identification and interpretation of the (social) environment is facilitated by awareness of the structure of agent–agent interactions (including humans ‘in the loop’). We suggest relevant concepts and heuristics that can contribute to studies of degrees of embodiment of robots that interact with social environments. Manipulating and systematically investigating these heuristics permits variation of the degree of embodiment of such interaction-aware robots.",

This diversity is combined with a concentration of authors associated with five universities, Warwick, UMIST, Lancaster, Keele (UK) and Massachusetts Amherst (US) who account for more than 27% of all publications during the first 8 years.

Through the analysis, a total of 6 overarching categories emerged: contextualization, social and political aspects, rethinking practice, complexity and uncertainty, actuality of projects and broader conceptualization. These categories cover a broad range of different contributions with diverse and alternative perspectives on project management. The early RPM literature dates back to the 1980s, while the majority was published in 2006 onwards, and the research stream appears to be still active. A critical look at this brave new world exhibits the overall challenge for RPM to become much more diffused and accepted.",

While the field(s) of management theory and the history of modern ideas in management, business education and organizations have many different intellectual roots, the Carnegie Mellon Behavioral trio (James March, Herbert Simon and Richard Cyert) who founded the behavioral perspective on organizations stand out not just for their collective contribution to founding the field of organizational behavior as we know it today, but also for their subsequent individual contributions to the field. Organizations and Behavioral Theory of the Firm set the stage for several subsequent developments in organization and management theory including research on learning, strategic management, organizational economics and organizational routines (Gibbons, 2003, Pierce et al., 2002, Williamson, 2002, 2004; Augier and Teece, 2005, Augier and Teece, 2009). In addition to providing some background on the Carnegie work, this paper traces the genealogy and development of some of the work of the founding fathers, and making the points that (1) while the work of Herbert Simon crossed disciplinary boundaries, he saw himself as doing only one thing, working in understanding limited rationality in decision making and (2) the work of James March shaped the field in a co-evolutionary way since he has been influenced too by the developments in organization studies.",

Continuing research shows that these concepts are not inaccurate, but they are certainly incomplete. In this review, we focus on the song control circuit of songbird species to demonstrate how each of these concepts is limited. We discuss the solid evidence for steroid synthesis within the brain (“neurosteroidogenesis”), the role of neurosteroids in organizational events that occur both early in development and later in life, and how neurosteroids can act in acute and non-traditional ways. The songbird model therefore illustrates how neurosteroids can dramatically increase the diversity of steroid-sensitive brain functions in a behaviorally-relevant system. We hope this inspires further research and thought into neurosteroid signaling in songbirds and other animals.",

Many observers now believe that a “new” climate governance is emerging through transnational and/or local forms of action that will eventually plug the resulting governance gaps. Yet states, which remain oddly absent from most discussions of the “new” governance, will remain key players as governance becomes more polycentric. This paper introduces a special issue that explores the ability of states to rise to these interconnected challenges through the analytical prism of policy innovation. It reveals that policy innovation is much more multi-dimensional than is often thought; it encompasses three vital activities: invention (centering on the ‘source’ of new policy elements), diffusion (that produces different ‘patterns’ of policy adoption), and the evaluation of the ‘effects’ that such innovations create in reality. The papers, which range from qualitative case studies to large ‘n’ quantitative studies, offer new insights into the varied roles that states play in relation to all three. They show, for instance that: the policy activity of states has risen dramatically in the past decade; that state innovation is affected to similar degrees by internal and external factors; and that policies that offer flexibility to target groups on how to meet policy goals are most effective but that voluntary reporting requirements are ineffective. This paper draws upon these and many other insights to offer a much more nuanced reflection on the future of climate governance; one that deservedly puts states at the front and center of analysis.",

abstract = "This study emphasizes the utility of decentralized urban planning in a developing region. The multi criteria evaluation (MCE) method was applied to produce suitability surfaces for agriculture, environmental protection and urbanization. The SLEUTH urban growth model was calibrated using two of the suitability maps: agriculture and environmental protection whereas the urbanization suitability layer was used for evaluating the results. These layers were used as weighted excluded inputs under two scenarios of agricultural land protection (AP) and environmental protection (EP). In this way ranges of resistance values against urbanization were provided for the SLEUTH model calibration. Hence, the model was forced to allocate urban clusters in locations with a minimum negative impact on farmlands and natural areas. The MCE-informed SLEUTH calibration assisted in performing decentralized urban growth allocation. Predicted under both scenarios (up to 2040) in the Gorgan township area, Iran; the major urban cores with large sizes were strictly constrained from further sprawl, instead, small scale and decentralized urban centers were established and started their own growth cycles. While substantial increase in the amount of impervious surface was allowed to occur, no meaningful negative impact was brought about on the land suitability of targeted land-uses. For both scenarios, the connectivity and compactness of urban patches were also investigated. The EP storyline yielded urban patches with more connectivity, while the AP scenario was more successful in retaining higher suitability values. The decentralized strategy can serve as a planning paradigm, which simultaneously considers several environmental parameters.",

Machines are limited in these abilities although various graph-based models have been used to link resources in the cyber space. The following are fundamental limitations of machine intelligence: (1) machines know few links and rules in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space, so it is not realistic to expect machines to discover laws and solve problems in these spaces; and, (2) machines can only process pre-designed algorithms and data structures in the cyber space. They are limited in ability to go beyond the cyber space, to learn linking rules, to know the effect of linking, and to explain computing results according to physical, physiological, psychological and socio laws. Linking various spaces will create a complex space — the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME. Diverse spaces will emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence. From multi-disciplinary perspective, this paper reviews previous ideas on various links, introduces the concept of cyber-physical society, proposes the ideal of the CP3SME including its definition, characteristics, and multi-disciplinary revolution, and explores the methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence. The methodology includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation. The CP3SME aims at an ideal environment for humans to live and work.

abstract = "Current investigation of cancer progression towards increasing malignancy focuses on the molecular pathways that produce the various cancerous traits of cells. Their acquisition is explained by the somatic mutation theory: tumor progression is the result of a neo-Darwinian evolution in the tissue. Herein cells are the units of selection. Random genetic mutations permanently affecting these pathways create malignant cell phenotypes that are selected for in the disturbed tissue. However, could it be that the capacity of the genome and its gene regulatory network to generate the vast diversity of cell types during development, i.e., to produce inheritable phenotypic changes without mutations, is harnessed by tumorigenesis to propel a directional change towards malignancy? Here we take an encompassing perspective, transcending the orthodoxy of molecular carcinogenesis and review mechanisms of somatic evolution beyond the Neo-Darwinian scheme. We discuss the central concept of “cancer attractors” – the hidden stable states of gene regulatory networks normally not occupied by cells. Noise-induced transitions into such attractors provide a source for randomness (chance) and regulatory constraints (necessity) in the acquisition of novel expression profiles that can be inherited across cell divisions, and hence, can be selected for. But attractors can also be reached in response to environmental signals – thus offering the possibility for inheriting acquired traits that can also be selected for. Therefore, we face the possibility of non-genetic (mutation-independent) equivalents to both Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution which may jointly explain the arrow of change pointing toward increasing malignancy.",

We report on the two interrelated components of the study, currently focused at the early advanced level of proficiency: a holistic framework created by the department's educators, and a linguistically oriented investigation that is grounded in systemic functional linguistics (SFL) and draws on its construct of grammatical metaphor (GM) for tracing knowledge creation in texts. Quantitative analysis of GM occurrence in the rated essays and analysis of syntactic complexity offer inconclusive results with regard to differentiating the quality of multiperspectival and reflective knowledge construction in the essays. However, qualitative exploration of the deployment of GM demonstrates its role as a resource in two forms of knowledge construction, the conceptual refiguration of content and the textual configuration of this content into knowledge.

The framework guides the process of identifying and explaining operative relationships and perspectives within human service program systems. Self-Determination Theory exemplifies how a foundational theory can be used to support the framework in a wide range of program evaluations. Two examples illustrate how applications of the framework have improved the evaluators’ abilities to observe and explain program effect. In both exemplars improvements involved addressing and organizing into a single logic model heretofore seemingly disparate evaluation issues regarding valuing (by whose values); the role of organizational and program context; and evaluation anxiety and utilization.",

However, what index or measure should be used to show the actual status of an SES remains an important research question. This paper presents the social–ecological status index (SESI), which measures social–ecological status based on social–ecological resilience and pressure. It is derived by using a spatially explicit framework that integrates various geophysical and socio-economic indicators. In this paper, its structural composition is explored and the proposed framework for deriving this index is compared with the current practice of evaluating SESs. Its relationship with certain other indicators is also assessed through a case study, thereby highlighting its application in the provinces of the Philippines. It is found that the SESI does not seem to favor either the human or the environmental dimensions of an SES. This is an important feature, indicating that the SESI is a neutral, more complete, and robust measure for social–ecological status assessment. With the increasing availability of geospatial and socio-economic data, the flexibility and adaptability of the framework allow the proposed index to be applied in other geographic locations, at the same time providing an avenue for its further development.",

We integrate a primary family science perspective, circumplex theory, to describe how an unbalanced family structure leads to unbalanced HR systems in the family firm. An unbalanced HR system is depicted as a form of bifurcation bias, or the asymmetric treatment of family and nonfamily employees via the family firm's HR practices. By integrating and extending circumplex theory into the family firm, insight is offered into how the structure of the family system influences the structure of the family business HR system, thus impacting firm outcomes.

abstract = "The oceans have long been recognized as one of humanity’s most important natural resources. Their vastness has made them appear to be limitless sources of food, transportation, recreation, and awe. The difficulty of fencing and policing them has left them largely as open access resources to be exploited by anyone with the means. However, in recent times we have begun to reach the limits of the oceans and must now begin to utilize and govern them in a more sustainable way. This paper summarizes emerging information on the interrelated ecological, economic, and social importance of the oceans, and on developing institutions for their sustainable governance. In addition to their traditional importance as sources of primary and secondary production, and biodiversiy, the importance of the oceans in global material and energy cycles is now beginning to be better appreciated. Integrated models of the global ocean–atmosphere–terrestrial biosphere system reveal the critical role of the oceans in atmospheric gas and climate regulation, and for water, nutrient, and waste cycling. Recent estimates of the economic value of the marketed and non-marketed ecosystem services of the oceans indicate a huge contribution to human welfare from the functions mentioned above plus raw materials, recreational, and cultural services. The oceans have been estimated to contribute a total of ∼21 trillion US$/year to human welfare (compared with a global GNP of ∼25 trillion US$), with ∼60% of this from coastal and shelf systems and the other 40% from the open ocean, and with the oceans contributing ∼60% of the total economic value of the biosphere (Costanza et al., 1997. The value of the world’s ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387, 253-260). The social importance of the oceans for global transportation and as a unifying element in the cultures of many coastal countries cannot be overestimated. However, the cultural traditions of open access must be replaced with more appropriate property rights regimes and governance structures. Some alternative sustainable governance ideas are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for an expanded deliberative process to develop a shared vision of a sustainable use of oceans.",

Achieving adequate management and protection of natural assets as ecosystems and their services, habitats, biodiversity requires that the socio-economic and human security needs of the coastal populations are met. One way to reach the goal is to enable them, representing about 50% of the global population and increasing, to fight poverty and cope with uncertainties and changing conditions of employment, environment and sustainability through proper governance of the coastal and ocean assets. This includes provision of education and knowledge as regards these assets and their proper uses. They include energy, water, food, transportation and trade, communication, coastal developments, tourism, recreation and ecosystem services, as well as the need to properly manage them. The present economic system cannot fully harmonize with the required governance, partly since the ecosystem resources and services are not internalised in the market-oriented system. This calls for a revised education and training system, more comprehensive than the present, taking into account the social, cultural and environmental requirements, and stressing the sustainable development paradigm. In order to achieve ocean governance and comprehensive human security an understanding of the system is needed. This is substantiated through the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development as well as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The aim here is to discuss some of the issues in context of implementation of related ocean conventions and commitments, which include achieving ocean governance, and to elucidate opportunities given by oceans and coasts, also in generating employment and providing for basic human needs.",

A number of initiatives are underway focusing on security issues in ports and ships (International Ship & Port Security Code), customs inspections in international ports (Container Security Initiative) and whole-of-supply chain outcomes (Customs & Trade Partnership against Terrorism). The main purpose of the above initiatives is to reduce the likelihood of maritime-vectored terrorism; however inappropriate implementation of these programs could affect competitiveness. This paper suggests that the complexity of interaction between ports, maritime operations and supply chains create vulnerabilities that require analysis that extends beyond the structured requirements of these initiatives and creates significant management challenges. Also the paper highlights the need for enhanced crisis management capabilities within ports as part of a standard management repertoire and suggests a new classification scheme for mapping vulnerability within ports and across supply networks. The paper concludes that there is a need to examine the goodness-of-fit of these security initiatives against business efficiency and competitiveness, and to consider the training needs for crisis management capabilities that will allow private and public sector groups involved in global trade to effectively mitigate the threat of maritime terrorism and loss of competitiveness.",

These regions are seen as instruments to balance public and private stakeholders, and offer health care to regional citizens as well as to medical/health tourists. However, it is still unclear how the development of such health regions as well as their governance may be conceptualized. We apply Luhmann's system theory approach in the context of a cross-regional case study that compares health region developments in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano–South Tyrol (Italy) with particular regard to the Eastern Dolomites and in the province of Zeeland (the Netherlands). We suggest that Luhmann's system theory provides a useful set of criteria to evaluate and judge health region development. Fully developed health regions can be understood as auto-poietic systems. By emphasizing programs, personnel, and communication channels, these case studies illustrate the suitability of the system theory toolset to analyze the governance and spatial embeddedness of health regions. Additionally, the study contributes to literature by indicating that health regions are closely related to identity issues and to decision making in regions.",

In principle, the competition can be understood as the shared effort to create ‘futures that would otherwise not be’ (Albrechts). One possible future is actually the formation of a metropolitan region in Finland, which does not yet exist, at least in any formal sense. Even though it does not yet exist, the making of a metropolis is high on the agenda of many actors in Finland.

It will present and comment on the Greater Helsinki Vision competition and also its follow-up process. After this, the article will also reflect on the current academic and planning debate regarding metropolitan regions, their existence and function, and their ambivalences for societal and territorial development. The final conclusions will look into theoretical aspects of ‘vision making’, post-modern planning, and how a territorial response capacity can be shaped to create different futures.",

We suggest examining human mobility on the local scale through the faunal record to better understand human-environmental interactions during the early dispersal of anatomically modern humans along the Mediterranean coast. Riparo Bombrini is located in the renowned Balzi Rossi complex in Northwest Italy. The site offers an excellent opportunity to compare two distinct Protoaurignacian levels yielding well-documented and well-dated deposits. Previous studies of spatial, lithic, and raw material data from these two Protoaurignacian levels have revealed distinct mobility signatures as well as undeniable evidence for the resilience of the Protoaurignacian technocomplex during episodes of climatic instability including the HE4 event, circa 40ka cal BP. The highly fragmented nature of the animal bones at the site warrants the application of the ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) collagen fingerprinting technique. For this research we carried out taphonomic and archaeozoological analyses with integrated systematic ZooMS using a mass sampling strategy. The results suggest stability in hunting strategies over time in spite of the apparent shift in mobility strategies from level A2 to level A1 at Riparo Bombrini.",

While each of these perspectives offers important insights, and some theoretical convergence is evident, the field remains divided along a number theoretical fracture lines. Two deeply rooted metatheoretical assumptions—essentialism and nominalism—are hindering the construction of a more integrated perspective on vulnerability, one capable of addressing the interrelated dynamics of social structure, human agency and the environment. We conclude by suggesting that an evolutionary perspective on social change, grounded in a critical realist epistemology, provides the best prospect for avoiding the above pitfalls and advancing our understanding of vulnerability.",

abstract = "As yet, in vitro assessment of the immunotoxic potency of respiratory agents is not possible. The complexity of the endpoint and the respiratory tract, and the limited availability of well-documented respiratory agents are the main reasons. The evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) are triggered by compounds to express in vitro surface proteins and soluble mediators, has stimulated their use for developing tests for respiratory immunotoxicity. A variety of airway ECs and EC-lines have been assessed, but the available information seems to point at human alveolar cells (e.g., A549) as the most convenient cell type. EC-based test formats with various degrees of complexity have been assessed. Sofar, promising results were obtained using a 3D model using the human A549 lung cell line. Dendritic cells (DCs) have been subjected to intensive research. However, currently available tests are not well suited to discern among the potency of sensitizers. Potential explanations include the lack of standardised protocols for the generation of DCs, no good standards for estimating the quality of in vitro derived DC-cultures, and limited dynamics of the currently used end-points. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) have sofar received less attention. This may proof unjustified as macrophages may link innate responses to adaptive immunity. The observation that ECs, DCs and AMs affect each other, suggests that test formats are required combining at least two of these cell types if ranking of compounds according to their sensitising potency is the aim. In addition, the capacity of compounds to cross a cellular membrane is an important property of an immunotoxic compound, which can be assessed only in 3D reconstituted human tissue models. While promising data have been reported for the skin, immunocompetent 3D reconstituted human lung remains to be evaluated for respiratory immunotoxicity. Obviously, the success of any of these simplified test (as compared to the complexity of the immune response) is highly dependent on the availability of early stage biomarkers (expressed at mucosal barrier level) that are predictive for relevant immunotoxicity mechanisms occurring down-stream of the immune response. As yet, such biomarkers are not yet available.",

Co-owned forest managing models, where different owners collaborate and forest users participate however, are still rather an exception of a rule. Bosland (literally forest-land) in Flanders (Belgium) is a statutory partnership of several public forest owners and stakeholders, managing an area of about 22,000ha of previously fragmented forest relicts. By looking at this case through transition lenses we describe a pioneering case in forest management where a new way of management is adopted more geared towards management for coherence across multiple ecosystem services and across a multitude of stakeholders. By use of a learning history we were able to reconstruct the change trajectory of Bosland. Analysis of this change trajectory through transition lenses aided to identify essential key features in which Bosland differs from ‘management as usual’ approaches:(i)a distinctive paradigm shift towards management for coherence;(ii)a long term vision that informs and guides the short-term action agenda;(iii)a bottom up approach focusing on participation and co-creation. The methods used and lessons learnt in Bosland can thus be highly interesting for the wider community involved in forest and nature management.",

abstract = "Nitric oxide (NO) is an inevitable product of life in an oxygen- and nitrogen-rich environment. This reactive diatomic molecule exhibits microbial cytotoxicity, in large part by facilitating nitrosative stress and inhibiting heme-containing proteins within the aerobic respiratory chain. Metabolism of NO is therefore essential for microbial life. In many bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, the evolutionarily ancient flavohemoglobin (flavoHb) converts NO and O2 to inert nitrate (NO3−) and undergoes catalytic regeneration via flavin-dependent reduction. Since its identification, widespread efforts have characterized roles for flavoHb in microbial nitrosative stress protection. Subsequent genomic studies focused on flavoHb have elucidated the transcriptional machinery necessary for inducible NO protection, such as NsrR in Escherichia coli, as well as additional proteins that constitute a nitrosative stress protection program. As an alternative strategy, flavoHb has been heterologously employed in higher eukaryotic organisms such as plants and human tumors to probe the function(s) of endogenous NO signaling. Such an approach may also provide a therapeutic route to in vivo NO depletion. Here we focus on the molecular features of flavoHb, the hitherto characterized NO-sensitive transcriptional machinery responsible for its induction, the roles of flavoHb in resisting mammalian host defense systems, and heterologous applications of flavoHb in plant/mammalian systems (including human tumors), as well as unresolved questions surrounding this paradigmatic NO-consuming enzyme.",

abstract = "While the concept of the Anthropocene reflects the past and present nature, scale and magnitude of human impacts on the Earth System, its true significance lies in how it can be used to guide attitudes, choices, policies and actions that influence the future. Yet, to date much of the research on the Anthropocene has focused on interpreting past and present changes, while saying little about the future. Likewise, many futures studies have been insufficiently rooted in an understanding of past changes, in particular the long-term co-evolution of bio-physical and human systems. The Anthropocene perspective is one that encapsulates a world of intertwined drivers, complex dynamic structures, emergent phenomena and unintended consequences, manifest across different scales and within interlinked biophysical constraints and social conditions. In this paper we discuss the changing role of science and the theoretical, methodological and analytical challenges in considering futures of the Anthropocene. We present three broad groups of research questions on: (1) societal goals for the future; (2) major trends and dynamics that might favor or hinder them; (3) and factors that might propel or impede transformations towards desirable futures. Tackling these questions requires the development of novel approaches integrating natural and social sciences as well as the humanities beyond what is current today. We present three examples, one from each group of questions, illustrating how science might contribute to the identification of desirable and plausible futures and pave the way for transformations towards them. We argue that it is time for debates on the sustainability of the Anthropocene to focus on opportunities for realizing desirable and plausible futures.",

The ASC framework aims at explaining the dynamic agent-system relationships in supply chains whereby both action-influencing properties of human agents (e.g., beliefs, personalities, attitudes) and governance-influencing properties of supply chain systems (e.g., social norms, power-dependence, partnerial/adversarial relationship forms) mutually influence each other over time. Two empirical studies are conducted to illustrate how ASC can be a useful theoretical framework in supply chain research and to partially validate the central thesis of ASC in the contexts of partnerial/adversarial supply chain relationships and cooperative/competitive attitudes of human agents in supply chains. The results of both studies support the central thesis of ASC regarding the dynamic agent-system relationships. From two replicated experiments in Study 1, the results suggest that agents’ cooperative and competitive attitudes in business relationships are altered as they are exposed to different supply chain conditions of partnerial and adversarial relationships. In addition, from the multi-method research efforts in Study 2, the results from two survey studies and an experiment are largely consistent with one another, suggesting that personnel turnovers in existing supply chain systems can eventually lead to changes in supply-chain-system properties including the degrees of long-term commitment, information sharing, and joint problem-solving between supply chain partners, as well as the frequency of opportunism occurrences in the supply chains. Finally, we propound that the dynamic agent-system relationships proposed in the ASC framework can be a useful analytical lens in viewing various supply chain issues, such as supply chain evolutions and changes, supply chain designs and personnel decisions, and self-reinforcing feedback loops and decision tendencies in supply chains.",

In the SAT, the subject reports the duration of the aftereffect experience resulting from viewing a rotating spiral line. Ten trials are given in direct succession, thus providing ten duration scores in sequence. One of the major measures pertaining to the sequence is that of the final level of aftereffect duration (fL), referred to as SAT identity; another is an expression of linear regression or change in aftereffect duration over the ten trials (R) , referred to as SAT strategy.",

The case-study suggests that important steps have been taken towards an integrated and adaptive strategy development process, particularly through the development of informal stakeholder networks. However, constraints in enabling learning within the strategy development process mean that practical pathways of integration in such a large, global-scale city remain challenging to identify and perhaps even more so to implement.",

The role of local government is highlighted as significant within the Victorian Climate Change Adaptation Plan (2013) and it is recognised that the state government must work in partnership with local municipalities and communities to effectively respond to the impacts of climate change. This paper reflects on the characteristics of institutional responses to climate change and the extent to which local government ‘climate change alliances’ constitute an emergent and effective form of adaptive and integrative governance. The analysis draws on a review of recent literature and government reports focusing on local scale adaptation in Victoria as well as qualitative data from interviews with local government alliances. The traditionally weak institutional architecture at the local scale in Australia creates a significant challenge in adaptive governance for climate change. The research highlights the current and potential role of regional alliances to overcome structural, institutional and political obduracies as evidence of progress in building adaptive capacity at the local government and community scale.",

Then we employ a set of features (attributes) to characterize the trends such as the slope of the line segment, the goodness of approximation and the length of the trend. The derivation of a linguistic summary of a time series is then related to a linguistic quantifier driven aggregation of trends. For this purpose we employ the classic Zadeh's calculus of linguistically quantified propositions but, extending our previous works, with different t-norms in addition to the basic minimum. We show an application to the analysis of time-series data on daily quotations of an investment fund over an eight year period, present some interesting linguistic summaries obtained, and show results for different t-norms.

However, the decrease of abundance of fishery resources jointly with a higher dependency on the aquaculture development and canning industry led to a decrease of dependency on algae gathering with medicinal and fertilizing use. The objectives of the paper are three-fold: (a) to investigate the links between customary uses of aboriginal communities living in the coast with marine ecosystem services (ES), (b) to characterize benefits, values of marine ES used by these communities, (c) to use the ecological knowledge of them to examine their perceptions towards the co-management system of SSF. Our results provide empirical evidence of a rich body of aboriginal knowledge, practices, beliefs and perspectives in both selected sites related to marine ES which is rooted in a ancient ecosystem perspective of the Mapuche–Williche׳s communities. However, authorities should recognize the existence and validity of the Mapuche-Williche׳s ecological knowledge to develop the management plans of the customary marine areas. It is demonstrated that aboriginal communities are suffering a selective erosion of ecological knowledge which is generation dependent, and which is mainly attributed to the development of aquaculture sector.",

We elaborate on value appropriation, first by pointing out the importance of “industry architectures”, i.e. sector-wide templates that circumscribe the division of labor; and second, by treating complementarity and factor mobility as distinctive components of co-specialization. This allows us to qualify Teece's prediction, by positing that firms can create an “architectural advantage” in terms of high levels of value appropriation without the need to engage in vertical integration. Such architectural advantage comes about when firms can enhance both complementarity and mobility in parts of the value chain where they are not active. We then elaborate on value creation by indicating how actors can benefit from investing in assets that appreciate because of innovation, which suggests that firms can benefit from encouraging imitation while investing in complementary assets. We also consider how investment in complementary assets changes the scope of the firm and thereby the development of capabilities that support future innovation. Finally, we provide an integrative guide that explains how firms should manage their position along the value chain to capture returns from innovation, thus extending and qualifying Teece's original 1986 predictions and prescriptions.",

The establishment of a change team to implement the guideline resulted in activities that impacted staff behaviour, which in turn was perceived to influence patients’ well-being. The guideline and contextual factors, such as leadership and staff colleagues’ attitudes, were of significant importance in that process. The study intervention—facilitation—promoted implementation activities and was highly appreciated by the change teams. However, reviewing the development of events at one of the control units, the provided facilitation appeared to be no more effective than an improvement-focused organizational culture in which the nurse manager was actively involved in the change process. Overall, learning and behaviour change seemed to be a social phenomenon, something that greatly benefited from people's interaction with one another.",

abstract = "The frontiers of automatic control are expanding to keep abreast of the state-of-the-art technology. Innovative concepts in control systems have relegated what was considered a satisfactory solution a decade ago to obsolescence today. One novel feature is artificial intelligence (AI) which has ability to cope with uncertainties that we encounter in today's complex process control. Intelligent control systems are becoming almost commonplace worldwide incorporating special features such as expert systems, self-tuning, self-diagnosis, life management, equipment health monitoring, modelling and simulation. Thus, a trend towards larger desalination plants necessitates more sophisticated automation technology. In view of the benefits that can be realized from the application of artificial intelligence in the control field of desalination processes, intelligent control is the application of AI in control, employing methods like expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic and pattern recognition. Thereby, learning and decision making are the most important features of intelligent control. The application of intelligent control is necessary due to computational complexity, nonlinear behaviour with many degrees of freedom, and the presence of uncertainty in control environment. Intelligent control can be used at different levels of control systems. On the highest level, monitoring of data, selection of algorithms, selection of objective functions, and assigning of values for the setpoints are the main aims. On the level of advanced regulatory control, process identification can be supported by intelligent control, e.g. selecting of structures by expert systems, implementing neural networks for parameter estimation etc. Expert systems, assisted by pattern recognition, can be used at this level for tuning of adaptive controllers. Adaptation of controller parameters according to an intelligent strategy can also be provided by neural networks. Also, expert systems can be used to assist the design of advanced control systems. In the large field of design of conventional control systems, artificial intelligence methods can be used to provide intelligent user interface, to select the best algorithms, to consider design heuristics for optimization of feedback control loops etc. The varying and uncertain conditions in a multistage flash (MSF) desalination plant during its operation in the annual cycle of seasons under different situations of loads and disturbances, point out that no single fixed strategy, no matter how advanced it may be, is likely to be either valid or possible at all times under all conditions in all the sub-systems related to the plant. This paper is addressed to some aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) which aims at equipping the process with the capability for continual analysis and assessment of the situations that arise during the course of operation of the plant leading to the choice and implementation of an appropriate course of action in process control. At the outset MSF plant conditions calling for consideration of advanced control strategies with AI support are highlighted. Then some aspects of AI applicable to plant control are reviewed, finally, suggestions towards intelligent control of MSF plants are made pointing also to the possibility of an integrated system for Process Control and Care.",

Despite their importance, questions remain regarding the assessment of silvicultural treatments designed to meet spatial objectives. We initiated a replicated silvicultural assessment of two forest management approaches commonly applied in dense ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest United States: historical evidence-based ecological restoration guidelines (ERG) and northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) foraging area management recommendations (GMR). We compared stand-level characteristics, global tree location point patterns and tree group-level attributes resulting from the marking of these approaches to current forest conditions and patterns of historical forest remnants in six, 2.02ha stem mapped plots. We also assessed group-level Vegetative Structural Stage (VSS; a classification of fine-scale forest structural development used to regulate fine-scale spatial patterns in these forests). ERG and GMR-based treatments significantly reduced densities and basal area from the current condition, but did not significantly differ in density from historical forest remnant estimates. GMR-based treatments retained greater stand level basal area than ERG-based treatments, primarily in large, 28–48cm tree diameter classes. GMR-based treatments approximated global tree location point patterns of forest remnants better than ERG-based treatments, primarily due to a 5–6m minimum spacing of residual trees, but also likely due to specific aspects of ERG-based marking techniques. Despite this difference, both treatments resulted in group-level characteristics similar to those exhibited by historical forest remnants. Both treatments significantly altered group-level VSS area and reduced variation of tree diameters within classified VSS groups. Our study provides insight how tree marking techniques using historical forest remnants may have important effects on resulting fine-scale forest structure patterns. We also demonstrate how the use of global point or group-level pattern assessment methods can affect the evaluation of fine-scale spatial pattern objectives. Our analysis of VSS group characteristics highlights implementation and assessment issues associated with group-level spatial pattern identification, classification and regulation. We conclude that group-level classification and regulation is not necessary for maintaining fine-scale spatial patterns in complex ponderosa pine ecosystems subject to frequent fire disturbances and changing future climate conditions and societal demands. Both ERG and GMR-based approaches applied in this study may have utility in maintaining fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and promoting resiliency in Southwest ponderosa pine forests.",

In this paper we develop a novel systems model, the Environmental Social Accounting Matrix (ESAM), of coupled GBCs (explicitly covering Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Sulphur) with a particularly focus on the environment-economy interface. We illustrate diagrammatically the level at which the global economy, through its transformation of useful resources (i.e. raw materials) into residuals (i.e. wastes, pollutants, emission), appropriates biogeochemical processes. Then through an application lens we discuss the ESAM’s potential applications and extensions. The ESAM represents one of only a few attempts to develop an integrated model of the Earth system, explicitly capturing the interaction in the element-based GBCs between both natural and human processes.",

abstract = "Jens Rasmussen has been a very influential thinker for the last quarter of the 20th century in the safety science field and especially in major hazard prevention. He shaped many of the basic assumptions regarding safety and accidents which are still held today. One can see that many of his ideas underlie more recent advances in this field. Indeed, in the first decade of the 21st century, many have been inspired by his propositions and have pursued their own research agendas by using, extending or criticising his ideas. The author of numerous articles, chapters of books and books, Rasmussen had an inspiring scientific research record spreading over 30years, expanding across the boundaries of many scientific disciplines. This article introduces selected elements of Rasmussen’s legacy, including the SRK model, his theoretical approach of errors, the issue of investigating accidents, his model of migration and the sociotechnical view. It will be demonstrated that Jens Rasmussen provided key concepts for understanding safety and accidents, many of which are still relevant today. In particular, this article introduces how some principles such as degree of freedom, self organisation and adaptation, defence in depth fallacy but also the notion of error as ‘unsuccessful experiment with unacceptable consequences’ still offer powerful insights into the challenge of predicting and preventing major accidents. It is also argued that they combine into a specific interpretation of the ‘normal accident’ debate, anticipating current trends based on complexity lenses. Overall, Jens Rasmussen defines the contours of what is called ‘a strong program for a hard problem’.",

The model, in addition to preserving the merits of geometric and syntactic approaches to pattern recognition, has decisive advantages over them. It can be viewed as a far-reaching generalization of the perceptron, or neural net, models, in which the vector representation and the associated vector operations are replaced by more general structural representation and the corresponding structural operations. The basis of the model is the concept of a transformation system, which is a generalization of Thue (Post-production) systems. Parametric distance functions in transformation systems are introduced. These are generalizations of weighted Levenshtein (edit) distances to more general structured objects. Learning model for transformation systems, unifying many existing models (including that of neural nets), is proposed. The model also suggests how various propositional object (class) descriptions might be generated based on the outputs of the learning processes: these descriptions represent “translation” of some information encoded in the nonpropositional “language” of the corresponding transformation system, representing the environment, into the chosen logical (propositional) language, whose semantics is now defined by the “translation”. In the light of the metric model the intelligence emerges as based on simple arithmetic processes: first, those related to the optimal distance computation, and, second, “counting” and comparing the results of counting for various “important” features, detected at the learning stage (arithmetic predicates).",

In contrast, ideas from a longstanding but little recognised literature on adaptive governance have potential to create innovative policy options for addressing the multiple interacting goals of Australian drought policy. From an adaptive governance perspective, the deep concern held by Australian society for rural communities affected by drought can be viewed as a common property resource that can be sustainably managed by governments in cooperation with rural communities. Managing drought assistance as a common property resource can be facilitated through nested and polycentric systems of governance similar to those that have already evolved in other arenas of natural resource management in Australia, such as Landcare groups and Catchment Management Authorities. Essential to delivering these options is the creation of flexible, regionally distributed scientific support for drought policy capable of integrating local knowledge and informing the livelihood outcomes of critical importance to governments and rural communities.",

In this article we argue that an organismic perspective in character identification can alleviate a structural deficiency of mathematical models in biology relative to the ones in the physical sciences. The problem with many biological theories is that they do not contain the conditions of their validity or a method of identifying objects that are appropriate instances of the models. Here functionally important biological characters are introduced as conceptual abstractions derived within the context of an ontologically prior object, such as a cell or an organism. To illustrate this approach, we present an analytical method of character decomposition based on the notion of the quasi-independence of traits. Two cases are analyzed: context dependent units of inheritance and a model of character identification in adaptive evolution. We demonstrate that in each case the biological process as represented by a mathematical theory entails the conditions for the individualization of characters. Our approach also requires a conceptual re-orientation in the way we build biological models. Rather than defining a set of biological characters a priori, functionally relevant characters are identified in the context of a higher level biological process.",

Objective
This article delineates a relatively unknown path in the history of medical philosophy and medical diagnosis. It is concerned with the phenomenon of vagueness in the physician's “style of thinking” and with the use of fuzzy sets, systems, and relations with a view to create a model of such reasoning when physicians make a diagnosis. It represents specific features of medical ways of thinking that were mentioned by the Polish physician and philosopher Ludwik Fleck in 1926. The paper links Lotfi Zadeh's work on system theory before the age of fuzzy sets with system-theory concepts in medical philosophy that were introduced by the philosopher Mario Bunge, and with the fuzzy-theoretical analysis of the notions of health, illness, and disease by the Iranian-German physician and philosopher Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh.
Material
Some proposals to apply fuzzy sets in medicine were based on a suggestion made by Zadeh: symptoms and diseases are fuzzy in nature and fuzzy sets are feasible to represent these entity classes of medical knowledge. Yet other attempts to use fuzzy sets in medicine were self-contained. The use of this approach contributed to medical decision-making and the development of computer-assisted diagnosis in medicine.
Conclusion
With regard to medical philosophy, decision-making, and diagnosis; the framework of fuzzy sets, systems, and relations is very useful to deal with the absence of sharp boundaries of the sets of symptoms, diagnoses, and phenomena of diseases. The foundations of reasoning and computer assistance in medicine were the result of a rapid accumulation of data from medical research. This explosion of knowledge in medicine gave rise to the speculation that computers could be used for the medical diagnosis. Medicine became, to a certain extent, a quantitative science. In the second half of the 20th century medical knowledge started to be stored in computer systems. To assist physicians in medical decision-making and patient care, medical expert systems using the theory of fuzzy sets and relations (such as the Viennese “fuzzy version” of the Computer-Assisted Diagnostic System, Cadiag, which was developed at the end of the 1970s) were constructed. The development of fuzzy relations in medicine and their application in computer-assisted diagnosis show that this fuzzy approach is a framework to deal with the “fuzzy mode of thinking” in medicine.",

The impacts of climate (and other) concurrent changes prompt consideration of further iterations for both conservation means and objectives. In this paper we bring together previous disparate literatures and apply them to the question of how to adapt conservation polices to suit an era of climate change impacts. Our approach is based on two assertions: (i) that the integration of specific natural and social science insights is essential for understanding and effectively responding to this challenge, and (ii) that in addition to adaptive conservation means (strategies), attention needs to be given to considering adaptive conservation objectives. Specifically, we convert a core set of natural and social science insights into analytical tools known as heuristics or rules of thumb. We then use the heuristics as a basis to offer a list of preliminary propositions that can help inform the development of new means and objectives. The propositions address key considerations including recalibrating management objectives, the role of disturbance in facilitating ecological transitions, and overarching topics relating to governance. The propositions are speculative, and so intended only to outline potential avenues for further empirical research and subsequent refinement. In the spirit of adaptation, we expect and welcome their revision.",

abstract = "Diffuse microbial pollution from agriculture is a key contributor to water quality impairment. Reducing the risk of microbial contamination of watercourses from agricultural sources requires both environmentally appropriate and socially acceptable mitigation and management approaches. A cross-disciplinary toolkit for on-farm microbial risk assessment is presented that can represent both social and environmental factors promoting or preventing the accumulation of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) within the farm environment, and also their subsequent transfer to watercourses. Four key risk criteria were identified as governing FIO loss from land to water. These were ‘accumulating E. coli burden to land’, ‘landscape transfer potential’, ‘infrastructure’ and ‘social and economical obstacles to taking action’. The toolkit can be used to determine (i) the relative risk of a farm enterprise contributing to microbial watercourse pollution and (ii) appropriate and targeted mitigation to reduce the risk of FIO loss from land to water. A comparison of the toolkit output with microbiological water quality draining from three contrasting grassland farm enterprises provided a preliminary evaluation of the prototype approach. When applied to 31 grassland farm enterprises the toolkit suggested that 0% were categorised as negligible risk, 32% low, 65% medium, 3% high and 0% very high risk. Such qualitative risk-based tools can assist the policy community not only to target high risk areas, but also to develop mitigation strategies that are sensitive to the different ways in which risk is produced. Capacity for long-term cross-disciplinary research is argued to be the means by which these integrated and more sustainable solutions may emerge.",

We begin by developing a theoretical framework of nuclear socio-political economy based primarily upon the evolution of nuclear energy in France. This framework posits that (1) strong state involvement in guiding economic development, (2) centralization of national energy planning, (3) campaigns to link technological progress to a national revitalization, (4) influence of technocratic ideology on policy decisions, (5) subordination of challenges to political authority, and (6) low levels of civic activism are influential factors in supporting development of nuclear power. Accordingly, we seek to verify the causal properties of these six catalysts for nuclear power expansion in two nations – India and China – that are on the brink of becoming major nuclear powers. We validate our framework by confirming the presence of the six catalysts during the initial nuclear power developmental periods in each country. We also apply our framework as a predictive tool by considering how present conditions in the two nations will impact nuclear power development trends. We conclude by highlighting the emergence of a potential seventh catalyst – the influence of greenhouse gas emission abatement policy on nuclear power development.",

abstract = "The dominance of “ecosystem services” as a guiding concept for environmental management – where it appears as a neutral, obvious, taken-for-granted concept – hides the fact that there are choices implicit in its framing and in its application. In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services idea is mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies. Ecosystem services, as an idea and tool, are mobilized by diverse actors in real-life situations that lead to complex, regionally particular and fundamentally political outcomes.",

Remediation of these sites is essential for protecting the soil and groundwater resources and reducing risks to local communities. Although many efforts have been made, effective design and management of various remediation systems are still challenging to practitioners. In recent years, the subsurface simulation model has been combined with techniques of optimization to address important problems of contaminated site management. The combined simulation-optimization system accounts for the complex behavior of the subsurface system and identifies the best management strategy under consideration of the management objectives and constraints. During the past decades, a large number of studies were conducted to simulate contaminant flow and transport in the subsurface and seek cost-effective remediation designs. This paper gives a comprehensive review on recent developments, advancements, challenges, and barriers associated with simulation and optimization techniques in supporting process control of petroleum waste management and site remediation. A number of related methodologies and applications were examined. Perspectives of effective site management were investigated, demonstrating many demanding areas for enhanced research efforts, which include issues of data availability and reliability, concerns in uncertainty, necessity of post-modeling analysis, and usefulness of development of process control techniques.",

We find that highly-connected agents, structural equivalents of leaders in empirical studies, advance on-going change by spreading competing variants. Isolated agents, or loners, holding on to existing variants are safe-keepers of variants considered old or new depending on the current state of the rest of the population. Innovations spread following a variety of S-curves and stabilize as norms in the network only if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: (1) the network comprises extremely highly connected and very isolated agents, and (2) agents are biased to pay proportionally more attention to better connected, or popular, neighbors. These findings reconcile competing models of individual network roles in the selection and propagation process of language change, and support Bloomfield's hypothesis that the spread of linguistic innovations in heterogeneous social networks depend upon communication density and relative prestige.",

The evolution of the field has been from descriptions of randomly connected neurons transmitting all-or-none signals to analyses of structured multi-level networks whose dynamics involve several different spatial and temporal scales. The cybernetic revolution of the 1940s led to the incorporation into digital neural models of such concepts as linear threshold logic, redundant computation, and information. Each of these concepts has more recently been synthesized with learning to generate a set of adaptive neural models. Concurrently, a variety of data from neurophysiology and from experimental psychology suggested models that incorporated continuous and nonlinear effects. Since the late 1960s there has been much activity in the design of rules for modifiable synapses in models of learning or conditioning. There has also been much activity in the design of lateral inhibitory networks that model sensory pattern storage. The development of models of these effects is outlined, together with that of multi-level networks that combine modifiable synapses and lateral inhibitory anatomies. These multi- networks model such psychological effects as reinforcement, attention, coding of feature detectors, and interactions between short-term and long-term memory.",

According to this view language codes cultural information and as such forms the basis for the evolution of complexity in human culture. In this article we develop the theory that language also codes information in another sense: languages code information on their own structure. As a result, languages themselves provide information that influences their own survival. To understand the consequences of this theory we discuss recent computational models of linguistic evolution. Linguistic evolution is the process by which languages themselves evolve. This article draws together this recent work on linguistic evolution and highlights the significance of this process in understanding the evolution of linguistic complexity. Our conclusions are that: (1) the process of linguistic transmission constitutes the basis for an evolutionary system, and (2), that this evolutionary system is only superficially comparable to the process of biological evolution.",

The significant advances in software from the 2nd-generation system include the following: (1) Five experiment-planning modules have been incorporated to match different types of scientific experimentation, including open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The five modules enable plans to be composed for general-purpose (GP), decision-tree (DT), factorial design (FD), composite modified Simplex (CMS) and multidirectional search (MDS) experiments. (2) Parallel experimentation and adaptive experimentation have been blended so that some decision-making can be done using objective functions or early-termination functions while multiple experiments are in progress. Some planning modules (CMS, MDS and DT) can cause new experiments to be spawned based on the chemistry data obtained. (3) Decision-making can involve the local course of individual experiments and/or the global course of sets of experiments. (4) Resource management features provide the capability to look-ahead at experiments in queue, assess resource (chemicals, containers) availability and designate suitability for implementation. (5) Intelligent reagent-handling features support the autodilution of reagents, autoselection of appropriate stock solutions, autoassignment of containers and control over reaction volumes. (6) Opportunistic rescheduling features have been provided so that pending experiments can be advanced in queue whenever possible, leading to compressed experimental timeframes. (7) Templates composed for FD, CMS and MDS experiments can be stored and reused with modifications as required for specific experiments. (8) The scheduling module contains both a rigid scheduler and a flexible scheduler. (9) The software is modular and runs under Windows 95.

In this paper we demonstrate how to use social network analysis to investigate the structural characteristics of supply networks. Our theoretical framework relates key social network analysis metrics to supply network constructs. We apply this framework to the three automotive supply networks reported in Choi and Hong (2002). Each of the supply networks is analyzed in terms of both materials flow and contractual relationships. We compare the social network analysis results with the case-based interpretations in Choi and Hong (2002) and conclude that our framework can both supplement and complement case-based analysis of supply networks.",

The monograph focuses on two perspectives of GIS-based land-use suitability analysis: the techno-positivist perspective and the socio-political, public participation perspectives. It is organized into six chapters. After an introductory setting chapter, which defines the scope of land-use suitability analysis, an overview of relevant GIS technology is provided in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 offers an historical account of the development of GIS. It also discusses the development of GIS in the context of evolving perspectives of planning. Chapter 4 gives an overview of the methods for GIS-based land-use suitability modeling. The overview provides a background against which selected case studies are discussed in Chapter 5. The concluding chapter summarized the main points of the monographs and discusses problems and prospects for GIS-based land-use suitability analysis.",

To characterize only genetic disorders, such as conditions with progressively earlier symptoms and higher intensity of disease from generation to generation, in terms of anticipatory expression is rather limited and limiting. Practitioners of medical care could benefit from understanding anticipation as definitory of the living. This view explains why diminished anticipatory expression, in all forms of the living, results in conditions calling for medical attention. So far, medicine has opted for a deterministic-reductionist perspective that reduces the living to a machine. Medical care, stuck in the grey zone between success and failure, should overcome its reactive obsession. From an almost exclusively mechanistic activity, it should evolve into a holistic proactive practice of well-being that reflects awareness of anticipation.",

It argues that theoretical concepts such as transition theory can provide a lens through which resilience pathways at community level can be better understood, and proposes a framework focused on a social resilience approach for understanding community resilience as the conceptual space at the intersection between economic, social and environmental capital. It argues that certain types of communities are losing resilience through increased embeddedness into globalized pathways of decision-making, while other communities may be gaining resilience, although not one system is either totally resilient or totally vulnerable. Striking the right ‘balance’ between communities and their scalar interactions with the global level is key for maximization of community resilience: while too much isolation of a community may be bad in light of over-dependency on local resources, skills and people, ‘over-globalization’, with possible loss of autonomy and identity, may be equally fraught with problems. In particular, relocalized communities have, so far, not shown much tangible success, as almost all members of the relocalization process at community level are simultaneously embedded within the global capitalist system through their dependencies on global economic processes.",

It addresses three questions: 1) if what is being witnessed is a transition to more inclusive, engaging, empowering, place-sensitive modes of urban climate governance gaining authority to deliver climate policy, how should these transitions be conceptualized and analysed? 2) how do transitions towards collaborative governance and regenerative sustainability and the deployment of authority in these transitions serve manage the risk of flooding in places with different cultural and climatic settings? 3) what do different cases demonstrate in terms of the practical pathways and examples of implementation of regenerative sustainability? Conceptual and empirical understandings are needed to assess whether these new, flexible forms of governance might ultimately challenge state-centred authority in the policy responses to climate change.

Nevertheless, some concerns have recently been raised with regard to the sufficiency of current embodied AI for advancing our scientific understanding of intentional agency. While from an engineering or computer science perspective this limitation might not be relevant, it is of course highly relevant for AI researchers striving to build accurate models of natural cognition. We argue that the biological foundations of enactive cognitive science can provide the conceptual tools that are needed to diagnose more clearly the shortcomings of current embodied AI. In particular, taking an enactive perspective points to the need for AI to take seriously the organismic roots of autonomous agency and sense-making. We identify two necessary systemic requirements, namely constitutive autonomy and adaptivity, which lead us to introduce two design principles of enactive AI. It is argued that the development of such enactive AI poses a significant challenge to current methodologies. However, it also provides a promising way of eventually overcoming the current limitations of embodied AI, especially in terms of providing fuller models of natural embodied cognition. Finally, some practical implications and examples of the two design principles of enactive AI are also discussed.",

Using the distinction between curing and healing, I do not question the curative potential of family therapy, but I question whether this kind of doctor/patient interaction promotes healing. Also, by demonstrating how the systems model tends to objectify patients and alienate therapists from those they treat, this paper challenge claims that family therapy recognizes the social nature of illness. The dehumanizing treatment cannot be attributed solely to the therapists, but requires further interpretation by analyzing the biases of the therapy model, the commodified context of the workshops,and epistemological issues arising from the application of general systems theory to a social model of treatment. Family systems therapy shares epistemological features with biomedicine, and like the biomedical model, alienates therapists from patients. This alienation, ironically, can be even greater when the family systems model is used than in biomedical treatment. Finally, I suggest that family therapy workshops have grown in popularity because the mechanistic features of the treatment model, drawn largely from cybernetics, promote the production and reproduction of a form of therapy compatible with the emphasis on ‘functional health’ favored in an advanced capitalist society.",

abstract = "Adaptation is a complex, dynamic, and sometimes unequal process. Stemming from social ecological systems theories of climate change adaptation and adaptive capacity, this case study introduces the concept of ‘divergent’ adaptation. Adaptation is divergent when one user or group's adaptation causes a subsequent reduction in another user or group's adaptive capacity in the same ecosystem. Using the example of pastoral and agricultural groups in northern and southern rainfall zones of Niger, this study illustrates the concept of divergent adaptation by identifying changes to the adaptive capacity of users who are currently engaged in conflicts over access to natural resources. Similar to other studies, we find that expansion of farmland and the consequent loss of pastoral space are restricting pastoral adaptation. Divergent adaptations favoring agricultural livelihoods include cultivating near or around pastoral wells or within pastoral corridors, both of which limit the mobility and entitlements of pastoralists. Institutions rarely secure pastoral routes and access to water points, a problem that is compounded by conflicting modes of governance, low accountability, and corruption. The case study illustrates the need to enhance the adaptive capacity of multiple user groups to reduce conflict, enhance human security, and promote overall resilience.",

Suitable integral indicators or indices matching the ‘ecosystem approach’ (EA) and thus covering ecological as well as socio-economic aspects are required. There is, however, a clear friction between what can be delivered in terms of useful ‘(integral) indicators’ and what decision makers require us to deliver in terms of ‘simple, cheap, easy to understand’ while the real situation is extremely complex. This social, economic and ecological complexity has been an important impediment to the realisation of an EA that should guarantee ‘sustainability’. What is missing since the publication of the Brundtland report is technical co-operation between the decision makers and the natural and social scientists. To achieve development of integral indicators we propose to make the Odum food web concepts functional by the application of ecological network analysis (ENA) and at a scale where socio-economic and ecological information can be integrated, which is the ‘habitat’ level. At the habitat level ecological functioning (natural compartment), human activities (economic compartment) and ecosystem functions to humans (socio-ecological compartment) can be designated and measured. This process can further be facilitated by the use of the Driver-Pressure-State change-Impact-Response (DPSIR) approach. To facilitate weighing and decision making multi-criteria techniques can be used.",

abstract = "Context
Software product lines (SPLs) and Agile are approaches that share similar objectives. The main difference is the way in which these objectives are met. Typically evidence on what activities of Agile and SPL can be combined and how they can be integrated stems from different research methods performed separately. The generalizability of this evidence is low, as the research topic is still relatively new and previous studies have been conducted using only one research method.
Objective
This study aims to increase understanding of Agile SPL and improve the generalizability of the identified evidence through the use of a multi-method approach.
Method
Our multi-method research combines three complementary methods (Mapping Study, Case Study and Expert Opinion) to consolidate the evidence.
Results
This combination results in 23 findings that provide evidence on how Agile and SPL could be combined.
Conclusion
Although multi-method research is time consuming and requires a high degree of effort to plan, design, and perform, it helps to increase the understanding on Agile SPL and leads to more generalizable evidence. The findings confirm a synergy between Agile and SPL and serve to improve the body of evidence in Agile SPL. When researchers and practitioners develop new Agile SPL approaches, it will be important to consider these synergies.",

Many of the lessons and experiences of these two programs have been incorporated within the design of the National Estuary Program. This paper assesses the suitability of the National Estuary Program's Management Conference process for managing estuarine ecosystems. Based upon the characteristics of marine ecosystems, it appears that there are several requirements for the design of governance institutions for estuarine ecosystems; namely flexibility, adaptation, and ultimately a capacity to learn. On the basis of this analysis, it appears that the Management Conference process is flexible enough to stimulate the selection of the diverse issues and remedial actions that are required to address the environmental concerns appropriate for each estuary. Because of the lack of sufficient experience, it remains to be determined if a state's ‘ecological capacity’ will limit the implementation of the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs) that are produced by each estuary program. However, these limitations should be recognized both during the plans preparation and implementation. This paper also suggests that adaptive implementation approaches be adopted instead of viewing the CCMP as a static blueprint for an estuary's protection.",

We undertook a systematic search and review of individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for mental health in children and adolescents who are forcibly displaced to high-income countries. Exposure to violence has been shown to be a key risk factor, whereas stable settlement and social support in the host country have a positive effect on the child's psychological functioning. Further research is needed to identify the relevant processes, contexts, and interplay between the many predictor variables hitherto identified as affecting mental health vulnerability and resilience. Research designs are needed that enable longitudinal investigation of individual, community, and societal contexts, rather than designs restricted to investigation of the associations between adverse exposures and psychological symptoms. We emphasise the need to develop comprehensive policies to ensure a rapid resolution of asylum claims and the effective integration of internally displaced and refugee children.",

In this work we show how the long-term coevolution between peasants and their environment sustained habitats and species that are now declining along with rural exodus in a mountainous area of the Mediterranean, a region where the maintenance of diverse landscapes is very much related to the presence of traditional rural activities. We provide an account of agrosilvopastoral practices once performed by the local peasant community and show their embeddedness in a particular set of institutions and worldview within an adaptive social–ecological system. We argue that such practices constitute an essential social–ecological heritage entailing valuable insights for the conservation of Mediterranean landscapes under conditions of global change.",

The long-wave behavior in technoeconomic development was chosen to apply this theoretical framework. The time evolution of a technoeconomic system is described discretely as a logistically growing number of “interactors” adopting an emerging set of basic social and technological innovations. By using the logistic function as the probabilistic distribution of individuals exchanging and processing information in a finite niche of available information, it is possible to demonstrate that the rate of information entropy change exhibits a “wavy” aspect evidenced by a four-phased behavior denoting the unfolding of a complete long wave. The entire unfolding process, divided into two cycles, an innovation cycle and a consolidation cycle, is analyzed, and two very important threshold points are identified and discussed. The present theoretical analysis suggests that the technoeconomic system is not a purely chaotic process, but exhibits a limit-cycle behavior, whose basic mechanism is the periodical deployment and filling of information in a “leeway” field of active information. The pace of the process, and hence the duration of the long wave, is determined by two biological control parameters, one cognitive, driving the rate of exchanging and processing information at the microlevel, and the other generational, constraining the rate of transfer of knowledge (information integrated into a context) between successive generations at the macrolevel. Moreover, it is speculated that social systems mimic living systems as efficient negentropic machines, and making use of Prigogine's entropy balance equation for open systems, it is suggested that its cyclical behavior is probably the best way to follow nature's efficiency strategy.",

Two types of diagnostic signs, taken from an intake form used on applicants at a mental health center, were used to arrive at a diagnosis. This process was replicated with a computer program. This statistical model attempted to reflect the diagnostic process as it exists in the mind of the clinician. This paper has attempted to demonstrate that, while according to logic the two groups of diagnostic cues presented and worked with represent different universes of discourse, such divergent types of information do coexist in the mind of the clinician, and in spite of the variation in “meaning” that these cues represent (from the standpoint of differences within and between each class, in terms of logical type and level of complexity), they are used to achieve closure within the “inner space” of the interlocutor as he assesses the patient. The data suggest that these two types of information form units in the same sign system and also that their definition and application derive from their interrelationship; all such elements comprising a uniquely structured whole. The research demonstrates that once these elements are identified and combined into classes (factors), based on their structural relationship to a statistically derived axis, they can be organized according to a stochastic model that reflects the sequential nature of the diagnostic process. Thus this program can be used to generate a diagnostic label or category by recombining the unit classes according to principles derived from a semiexplicit conceptual definition of mental health and illness and a largely implicit set of assessment procedures. The diagnostic enterprise, as it exists in this study, was criticized from a number of perspectives. Most importantly, it was suggested that the diagnostic process is a complex perceptual, conceptual, and emotional act arising from a unique two-party transaction that exists in a larger context to which it is intimately related. Further, the position was advanced that the diagnostician makes use of many kinds of information not specified in the diagnostic sign repertoire (i.e., the lexicon taken as given was not exhaustive, and there are other unidentified modes of communication that coexist with the “given” set of diagnostic cues), which are combined according to rules of organization and transformation not contained in the computer program. Thus the diagnostic “act” is seen not as a linear stochastic process but as an ongoing series of interrelationships characteristic of complex open or semiopen systems that are goal-seeking and make use of positive and negative feedback loops that process many channels simultaneously and “correct” or adapt to the recognized discrepancies between internally and externally perceived patterns until closure (or a degree of certainty as yet not totally explicated) is achieved and a diagnosis assigned.",

Cyberneticians are naturally concerned with the logic of large systems and the logical calibre of the learning process. Physiological mechanisms are shown to be special cases of completely general systems exhibiting principles such as homeostasis and dynamic stability. The material dependence of a brain or an artifact suggests that manifestly coherent experience stems from a cohesive physical or intellectual environment of which the brain is a specialised part. A cybernetic model in which learning and cognition appear as components of an evolutionary process in a self organizing system is considered here. The model illuminates the role of “distributed” or “non-localized” functions and it possesses an interesting asymmetry which seems to account for some of the peculiar discontinuities in behavior associated with “attention” and “insight.” Recent work from other countries indicates a number of physiological mechanisms acting at a macromolecular level that may embody the required interactions.",

This paper describes an adaptive, view-based, relational map-making system for navigating within a 3D environment defined by a spatially distributed set of visual landmarks. Inspired by an analogy to learning aspect graphs of 3D objects, the system comprises two neurocomputational architectures that emulate cognitive mapping in the rat hippocampus. The first architecture performs unsupervised place learning by combining the “What” with the “Where”, namely through conjunctions of landmark identity, pose, and egocentric gaze direction within a local, restricted sensory view of the environment. The second associatively learns action consequences by incorporating the “When”, namely through conjunctions of learned places and coarsely coded robot motions. Together, these networks form a map reminiscent of a partially observable Markov decision process, and consequently provide an ideal neural substrate for prediction, environment recognition, route planning, and exploration. Preliminary results from real-time implementations on a mobile robot called MAVIN (the Mobile Adaptive VIsual Navigator) demonstrate the potential for these capabilities.",

The study presents a hierarchy of classification and analyses the determinants associated with pluralistic medical behavior. Case studies are used to illustrate how the villagers cope with severe illnesses. Finally, it is argued that indegenous illness concepts should be taken into consideration in the design of health-care projects.

abstract = "Central cities are vibrant and productive places because of the dense concentration of people, firms and supporting facilities. Yet their dynamism can be undermined by congestion, social tensions and poor urban management. South Africa’s four major city centres experienced tumultuous changes during the transition from apartheid and the exodus of many property owners, investors and occupiers to the suburbs. Buildings decayed, infrastructure collapsed, public health and safety deteriorated, and governance was disrupted by unauthorised activities. Despite the general neglect, signs of recovery have emerged and gathered momentum in recent years. The revival is fragile, partial and patchy in most cases, and dwarfed by scale of new investment in outlying economic nodes. The paper uses a resilience framework to examine how enterprising organisations have spurred regeneration by identifying opportunities for the adaptive reuse of redundant buildings and public spaces for affordable housing and social amenities. It also compares the extent, character and causes of the rebound across the four cities, demonstrating elements of continuity (bounce-back resilience) and transformation (bounce-forward resilience) in each case. Cape Town is characterised more by continuity and Johannesburg more by decline and transformation, with Pretoria and Durban in between. City centre recovery is attributed to a combination of pioneering private and public sector actions, albeit disjointed and uneven in their effectiveness. The paper concludes that central cities are relatively open incubators of economic and social progress, but also cauldrons of competing interests which create many dilemmas for decision-makers to negotiate, and which require coordinated attention and determination to realise their potential.",

Linguistic demands are expected to be challenging to English learner and proficient students alike. English learner (EL; n=62) and English-only or proficient (n=58) kindergarten, 3rd, and 5th grade students completed a mathematics task and explained their solutions. Overall, explanations of less complex strategies contained fewer words, shorter sentences, less frequent general academic vocabulary and temporal discourse connectors, and fewer characteristics of well-developed explanations. Explanations produced by English proficient students were linguistically more sophisticated but not more cogent than those of EL students. There were differences in connections between strategies and explanations by grade but few by EL status. We discuss implications for implementing new mathematics standards with all students.",

Velocity error was least for 1′s, greatest for N′s, and intermediate for T's, 4′s, and B's. For the bandlimited 4′s and B's, monkeys demonstrated the greatest relative amplitude response at the highest frequencies. Predictive mechanisms are classified as short- and long-term, depending on how much past target motion information is employed. The T's and a modification of this stimulus pattern involving a random perturbation were used to test the hypothesis that prediction is based exclusively on short-term signal processing related to target position and its derivatives. The existence of long-term predictive mechanisms in monkey smooth pursuit was unequivocally demonstrated with the use of the latter stimulus.",

abstract = "In this paper, it is claimed that the effective causality of long-term macroeconomic rhythms, most commonly referred to as long waves or Kondratieff waves, is founded in our biological realm. The observed patterns of regularity in human affairs, manifest as socioeconomic rhythms and recurrent phenomena, are constrained and codetermined by our natural human biological clocks, themselves the result of instructions impressed in the human genome and human cognitive capacity by the physical regularity of fixed cosmic cycles. Considering that a long wave can be conceived as an evolving learning dissipative structure consisting of two successive logistic structural cycles, an innovation cycle and a consolidation cycle, and applying considerations from population dynamics, chaos theory and logistic growth dynamics, a Generational-Learning Model is proposed that permits comprehension of the unfolding and time duration of the phenomenon. The proposed model is based on two kinds of biological constraints that impose the rhythm of collective human behavior — generational and cognitive. The generational consist of biologically based rhythms, namely, the Aggregate Virtual Working Life Tenure and the Aggregate Female Fecundity Interval, both subsets of the normative human life span or human life cycle. The cognitive consist of a limiting learning growth rate, manifest in the alternating sequence of two succeeding learning phases, a new knowledge phase and a consolidation phase. It is proposed that the syncopated beats of succeeding effective generational waves and the dynamics of the learning processes determine the long-wave behavior of socioeconomic growth and development. From the relationship between the differential and the discrete logistic equations, it is demonstrated that the unfolding of each structural cycle of a long wave is controlled by two parameters: the diffusion-learning rate δ and the aggregate effective generation tG, whose product maintained in the interval 3<δtG<4 (deterministic chaos) grants the evolution and performance of social systems. Moreover, it is speculated that the triggering mechanism of this long-term swinging behavior may result from the cohesion loss of a given technoeconomic system in consequence of reaching a threshold value of informational entropy production.",

Decision response and eye gaze data were analyzed and correlated. Results of a first experiment point to the inability of the human operator to visually ignore aircraft which are seen to converge on a plan view, even if they are obviously at very different altitudes, or aircraft which are moving as a group even though maintaining separation. In the second experiment we studied the effects of predictive warnings of differing reliabilities and different timing on both anticipation decisions and eye movements. Results showed that the early warning directed visual attention to the pair of targets, but did not elicit responses unless it was entirely reliable. Detection of collisions was not affected by the timing of the warning, but only by the reliability of the warning system. However, visual search patterns differed markedly between early and late warnings.",

Operator failure to exercise the appropriate supervisory control decisions often have an adverse effect on product quality, process safety, occupational health and environmental impact. The economic impact of such abnormal situations is enormous; about $20 billion/year in losses in the petrochemical industries alone in the US. Furthermore, process safety, occupational health and environmental hazards are ever increasing in importance in response to heightening public concern and the resultant tightening of regulations. Thus, there exists considerable incentive in developing intelligent control systems that can provide automated operator assistance for supervisory control situations for complex process plants. People in the process industries view this as the next major challenge in control systems research and application. The automation of process fault detection and diagnosis forms the first step in automating supervisory control and ASM. In this paper, I present an overview of the various approaches to fault diagnosis, challenges we face and encouraging emerging trends. The recent progress has promising implications on the use of intelligent systems for inherently safer design, operator training, abnormal situation management, process hazards analysis and optimal process operations.",
