Our study contributes to the topical subject of smart cities analysing the performance of an IoT-platform based solution. It evaluates if an IoT platform project can achieve business, environmental and social objectives all together. We select and test a project developed in Nice (France) where 5.000+ sensors are deployed on parking slots to improve the urban transport. The benefits of the IT project are determined comparing data extracting from Nice and compared with two other similar cities (Marseille and Toulon) which play the role of control group. The analysis of the value creation and value capture suggest a governance model for a private and public collaboration. Our findings help public managers to understand better private-public partnership and then prepare the future cities development.",

The Chinese government has been devoting to the promotion of smart cities for many years. However, it is unconfirmed whether the city is more resilient with all the modern technologies provided when unexpected predicaments like climate changes or disasters occur. Therefore, it is urgent to consider resilience in the smart city. This paper provides a MCDM approach to assess and rank the resilience of 187 smart cities in China. The results demonstrate that the overall resilience of smart cities is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance of resilience between smart cities due to different infrastructural, economic, social, institutional, and environmental conditions. The potential links between urban smartness and resilience were also explored, and the results showed significant positive relationship between the smartness of a city and its resilience. Evidence also proved that developing smartness is more or less useful for improving urban resilience. Suggestions such as strengthening the development of infrastructure and economy, and enhancing the multi-stakeholders’ cooperation are proposed to further promote the smart and resilient development in China.",

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

Subjective norm and trust are both not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval in the model of multiple-regression. Interestingly, it finds that trust moderates the relationship between subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention. It means that the audiologists' advice can positively affect person's behavioral intention in smart cities. The findings imply that the Theory of Reasoned Action can be partially used to explain the person's behavioral intention in Chinese context.

This research aims to build an effective and automated RPM system based on an information communication technology (ICT) framework that automatically triggers medical alerts, hospital visits, medications, and social support in a timely and precise manner, with specific attention to aging people. The goal of the proposed framework is to construct a safe, flexible, and manageable system containing multi-agent, auto-notice, sensor management, and secure transmission of data to allow an autonomous functioning of RPM.
Methods
The literature between 2002 and 2018 that introduces healthcare platforms with the technology of the Internet of things (IoT) is reviewed and compared in compliance with various technical and functional features. Eleven healthcare-based IoT platforms are compared. Eight of them utilize the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API), while ten of them have Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), seven of them have device management, and nine of them have security control. In addition, Kepware's KEPServerEX communication platform containing up to 250 communication protocols is included.
Results
The results confirm that the proposed framework reliably operates within the complex healthcare processes, taking into account the equipment management, security management, messaging and diversification of communication protocols. This study uses the concept of IoT 3-tier through which a complete sensor management mechanism is structured. Moreover, secure data connection protects the patient's privacy. Each sensor provides a distinctive notification to construct flawless authority management.
Conclusions
The proposed framework can not only reach the machine-to-machine (M2M) realm, but also provide support in emergency cases.",

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms—and underperforms—the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.",

abstract = "The new and disruptive technology of smart home applications (hereafter referred to as apps) based on Internet of Things (IoT) is largely limited and scattered. To provide valuable insights into technological environments and support researchers, we must understand the available options and gaps in this line of research. Thus, in this study, a review is conducted to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy. We conduct a focused search for every article related to (1) smart homes, (2) apps, and (3) IoT in three major databases, namely, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Explore. These databases contain literature focusing on smart home apps using IoT. The final dataset resulting from the classification scheme includes 229 articles divided into four classes. The first class comprises review and survey articles related to smart home IoT applications. The second class includes papers on IoT applications and their use in smart home technology. The third class contains proposals of frameworks to develop and operate applications. The final class includes studies with actual attempts to develop smart home IoT applications. We then identify the basic characteristics of this emerging field in the following aspects: motivation of using IoT in smart home applications, open challenges hindering utilization, and recommendations to improve the acceptance and use of smart home applications in literature.",

At the same time, various efforts have been made to evaluate performance and outcomes of those projects and initiatives. This study provides a critical analysis of 34 selected smart city assessment tools to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and to examine their potential contribution to the evolution of the smart city movement. The selected tools are evaluated against an analysis framework that covers criteria related to comprehensiveness, stakeholder engagement, context sensitivity, strategic alignment, uncertainty management, interlinkages and interoperability, temporal dynamism, flexibility, feasibility, presentation and communication of the results, and action plans. Results indicate that selected tools have achieved limited success in addressing these criteria. In particular, only few tools have addressed criteria related to stakeholder engagement, uncertainty management, interlinkages, and feasibility. The paper argues that assessment tools should capitalize on the advancements in smart solutions and big data analytics to develop better strategies for addressing these criteria. In addition to highlighting weaknesses that need to be addressed in the future, results of this study can be used by interested target groups such as smart city developers, planners, and policy makers to choose tools that best fit their needs.",

Hence, a benchmarking of eight urban services provided in the city of Santander has been carried out: waste management; water supply; traffic management; street lighting; augmented reality and tourism; incidences management, parks and gardens and citizen participation. Among the main results of our study, we highlight that those public services properly managed embedding IoT technology convey cost reductions in the long term. There is also a reduction in energy consumption and environmental impact with the consequent social impact. It should also be highlighted that most data are managed with the same platform.

The requirement for scalability, due to the possibly huge amount of involved sensors and devices, and the heterogeneous scenarios that might occur, impose resorting to sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques. In particular, multi-level simulation is regarded as a main framework that allows simulating large-scale IoT environments while keeping high levels of detail, when it is needed. We consider a use case based on the deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level simulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of simulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator (based on OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area, which allows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on this use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc wireless networking technologies do represent a principle tool to deploy smart services over decentralized countrysides. Moreover, the performance evaluation confirms the viability of utilizing multi-level simulation for simulating large scale IoT environments.",

Early symptoms may spread across years and often they are noticed only at late stages, when the outcomes remain irrevocable and require costly intervention plans. Therefore, the clinical utility of early detecting these conditions is of substantial importance in order to avoid hospitalization and lessen the socio-economic costs of caring, while it may also significantly improve elderly people’s quality of life. This work deals with a critical performance analysis of an Internet of Things aware Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system for elderly monitoring. The analysis is focused on three main system components: (i) the City-wide data capturing layer, (ii) the Cloud-based centralized data management repository, and (iii) the risk analysis and prediction module. Each module can provide different operating modes, therefore the critical analysis aims at defining which are the best solutions according to context’s needs. The proposed system architecture is used by the H2020 City4Age project to support geriatricians for the early detection of MCI and frailty conditions.",

abstract = "In recent years many initiatives have been developed under the Smart City label in a bid to provide a response to challenges facing cities today. The concept has evolved from a sector-based approach to a more comprehensive view that places governance and stakeholders' involvement at the core of strategies. However, Smart City implementation requires lowering the scale from the strategy to the project level. Therefore, the ability of Smart City initiatives to provide an integrated and systematic answer to urban challenges is constantly being called into question. Stakeholder involvement in both the projects and the city strategy is key to developing a governance framework that allows an integrated and comprehensive understanding. This can only be done if Smart City strategies take the stakeholders' opinion into account and seek a compromise between their views and the implementation of the strategy. Multiple attempts have been made to analyse Smart Cities, but tools are needed to understand their complexity and reflect the stakeholders' role in developing Smart City initiatives and their capacity to face urban challenges. This paper pursues two objectives: (A) to develop a conceptual model capable of displaying an overview of (a) the stakeholders taking part in the initiative in relation to (b) the projects developed and (c) the challenges they face; and (B) to use this model to synthesise the opinion of different stakeholders involved in Smart City initiatives and compare their attitudes to the key projects implemented in a corresponding SC strategy. The methodology combines project analysis with surveys and interviews with different groups of key stakeholders (governments, private companies, universities and research centres, and civil society) through text analysis. The conceptual model is developed through discussions with different European stakeholders and is applied to the case of the Vienna Smart City strategy.",

We found positive trend in University integrator role applying a mixed two-step methodology based on online survey of University students and interviews with decision-making stakeholders involved in SCPs (business, state, entrepreneurs and academia) in Italy and Russia. Our findings suggest significant new insights useful to reapply the mediating role of Universities and to highlight some newly arising opportunities in stakeholder engagement.

These dichotomies generate a critical knowledge gap because they suggest divergent hypotheses on what principles need to be considered when implementing strategies for enabling smart city development. This paper starts filling such a gap by reporting on the findings of a multiple case study analysis which is conducted into European best practices. In meeting this aim, four European cities considered to be leaders in the field of smart city development are analyzed to test the validity of the hypotheses emerging from each dichotomy. These cities are Amsterdam, Barcelona, Helsinki and Vienna. The results of this best practice analysis offer a series of critical insights into what strategic principles drive smart city development in Europe and generate scientific knowledge which helps to overcome the dichotomous nature of smart city research.",

The Smart City encapsulates all the desires and prospects on the transformative and disruptive role technology will have in solving urban issues both in Global North and Global South cities. Critical scholarship has pointed out that private capital, with the blessing of technocratic elites, has found a techno-environmental fix to both reshuffle economic growth and prevent other alternative politico-ecological transitions to take root in urban systems. Against this bleak outlook, the paper argues that these technological assemblages might be compatible with alternative post-capitalist urban transformations aligned with Degrowth. Through a cross-reading of research on Smart Cities with theoretical perspectives drawn from the literature on Degrowth, I suggest that Degrowth should not refrain from engaging with urban technological imaginaries in a critical and selective way. As the paper shows through alternative uses of Smart technologies and digital open-source fabrication, the question is not so much around technology per se but around the wider politico-economic context into which these technological assemblages are embedded.",

There are variety of definitions for smart city in different fields and regions. Generally, it aims for a sustainable city development through the optimal management of the resources and potential, offering a comprehensively higher quality life to the citizens. The planning of area energy system is one of the most important issues, which is related to the energy generation, the energy consumption by facilities, transportation system, and any other city infrastructures. Especially for Japan, one of the countries facing the complex issues of an aging society, disaster management and energy dependency need a new methodologies for optimal urban energy planning that integrates all information from these sectors. Smart city with highly developed information and communications technology (ICT) is considered as such an important approach. To encourage the smart city concept in Japan, this paper proposes a “GIS-BIM” based urban energy planning system to access the optimal technical and policy solution for readjust city infrastructure beyond the integrated analysis. Firstly, it introduces the concept of Japanese smart city which covers from urban planning to infrastructure. Secondly, the research proposes a GIS-BIM based urban energy planning system including the database construction and analysis by GIS, the optimal energy system design aided by BIM and 3D visualization with user-friendly interface. Finally, center of Tokyo is adopted as a case study, suggesting the potential to access the optimal technical and policy solution.",

abstract = "The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) applications for the development of innovative, sustainable, and smart cities has become a new model for municipal cooperation between government and corporations. Smart cities contribute to social stability and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are taken into account during the planning and management of such services. This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens' acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city engagement. The study contributes to the academic literature and also provides practical pointers for cities and technology suppliers embarking on smart city initiatives.",

The paper aims to explore effective measures and strategies for the promotion of ICT-enabled innovations for the elderly and people with special needs.
Methods
The paper begins by reviewing current government initiatives in the field of e-health and accessibility that are addressing challenges faced by Japan's rapidly ageing society. It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries.
Results and conclusion
The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population. It then outlines a number of strategic directions for the formulation of specific measures that will place Japan in the forefront of societal transformation.",

abstract = "The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where a selection of appropriate features and High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently select features and analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.",

Due to the increasingly serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders’ health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.",

As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey's growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey's multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city's hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city's schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart’ urban investment strategies.",

In order to overcome this crisis, cities of the future must find suitable trajectories and become smart cities. However, there is no consensus about what really makes a city smarter. What are the elements that a smart city must have in order to offer high quality of life and a prosperous environment for creativity and innovation? This paper aims at disclosing the driving elements that make a city smarter, based on the literature, interviews with experts, and insights from smart cities projects (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lisbon, Vienna). Results show that a smart city is an urban innovation ecosystem where knowledge easily flows from a deliberated interaction and collaboration among different stakeholders to create wealth, supported by a flexible institutional structure, an integrated-participative governance model, a digital-green infrastructure and a functional urban design with diversified amenities and facilities. We conclude that cities, to become smarter, should upgrade the elements related to their different dimensions, which are the techno-economic activity, the environ-urban configuration and the socio-institutional structures in an integrated manner, guided by an integrated and comprehensive governance model.",

ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.",

In this paper, we provide an overview of smart aging in three ways: 1) to synthesize the components of smart aging based on the comprehensive literature review, 2) to examine the range of topics extracted from 3760 web pages and 3) to analyze the research activities on smart aging by conducting a content analysis of 4500 web pages of the NIH funded organizations' websites related to smart aging. The results of the comprehensive literature review indicate that the discussions on smart aging in the scientific publications are by and large classified into the following three directions: Technologies, Aging Medical Care, and Behavior and Social. In addition, the major topics from search engine datasets, which echoes more general discussions from various different parties, are related to entertainment program and social media, along with medical science and innovation technologies, whereas the research activities of NIH funded organizations focused on cross-disciplinary research in Behavioral and Social science, and Medical Care.",

A possible solution to reduce healthcare costs in a world that is aging is the adoption of telehealth technologies. Several solutions appeared, in the past suggesting the use of smart devices (mobile phones or tablets) for supporting telehealth. Unfortunately, elderly people may have difficulties in the use of such devices even if user interfaces are becoming friendly and intuitive. This work introduces the concept of “Smartstone”, that is the use of a (low-cost) smartphone as a simple, effective, and portable gateway/edge server for mobile healthcare towards cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The Smartstone is designed in order to minimize the user interaction, thanks to its autonomous behavior. The adoption of smart devices as a building block ensures state-of-the-art connectivity and relatively high computational power, complemented by an ensemble of additional onboard sensors. In particular, results about the management of a new photoplethysmographic /bio-impedance monitor and a smart pill dispenser are presented in this work.",

Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.",

abstract = "The growing gap between users and the big data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of big data application and data science leads toward a new paradigm of human behavior, where various smart devices integrate with each other and establish a relationship. However, majority of the systems are either memoryless or computational inefficient, which are unable to define or predict human behavior. Therefore, keeping in view the aforementioned needs, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently analyze a stream of big data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that integrates social network with the technical network. We derive a novel notion of ‘Socio-Cyber Network’, where a friendship is made based on the geo-location information of the user, where trust index is used based on graphs theory. The proposed graph theory provides a better understanding of extraction knowledge from the data and finding relationship between different users. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce. MapReduce for cyber-physical system (CPS) is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently process a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using Spark GraphX tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes to generate and process graphs with near real-time. Moreover, the system is evaluated in terms of efficiency by considering the system throughput and processing time. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient.",

abstract = "This paper briefly explores the expected impact of the ‘Global Drivers’ (such as population demographics, food security; energy security; community security and safety), and the role of sustainability engineering in mitigating the potential effects of these Global Drivers. The message of the paper is that sustainability requires a significant input from Ergonomics/Human Factors, but the profession needs some expansion in its thinking in order to make this contribution. Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption). Appropriate changes are already being implemented in manufacturing industry, including new business models, new jobs and new skills. Considerable high-level planning around the world is in progress and is bringing about these changes; for example, there is the US ‘Advanced Manufacturing National Program’ (AMNP)’, the German ‘Industrie 4.0’ plan, the French plan ‘la nouvelle France industrielle’ and the UK Foresight publications on the ‘Future of Manufacturing’. All of these activities recognise the central part that humans will continue to play in the new manufacturing paradigms; however, they do not discuss many of the issues that systems ergonomics professionals acknowledge. This paper discusses a number of these issues, highlighting the need for some new thinking and knowledge capture by systems ergonomics professionals. Among these are ethical issues, job content and skills issues. Towards the end, there is a summary of knowledge extensions considered necessary in order that systems ergonomists can be fully effective in this new environment, together with suggestions for the means to acquire and disseminate the knowledge extensions.",

Owing to the heterogeneity of the participants in the working group, different viewpoints were put together, leading to some shared conclusions. In particular, the role played by the different narratives used in discussing the role of technology in facing global problems was pointed out as the origin of cognitive dissonance. The presented reflections address some conceptual weaknesses in the current debate on technology and global issues, framed in global policies that appear incapable to obtain tangible results. The technology optimism seems, in fact, to be based on the elusive use of both the concepts of technology and sustainability, that are put together for narrative purposes without an explicit conceptual assessment. On one hand, the factual role of technology and its beneficiary are almost never clearly addressed in the debate. On the other hand, the fact that any new technology will serve the cause of sustainability is not questioned whatsoever, without taking into account the social, political and ethical framework in which technology is supposed to be operated.",

abstract = "The aim of this study is to identify the impact of the personal beliefs of the elderly on their attitude toward using online public services. To test hypotheses regarding the determinants and background of technology readiness, questionnaires were administered to the elderly in Japan and in the UK, countries with a well-developed online public services infrastructure and an aging population. After structural equation modelling analysis, the research identified that aging satisfaction is the strongest factor in terms of influencing online public services usage, and this is developed through social interaction. Additionally, the research identified similarities and differences stemming from the cultural background of the respondents regarding their fear of using ICT. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the elderly's personal beliefs in terms of online technology usage and relevant social support, which may pave the way for determining an elderly-friendly social policy for diffusing new technology and services.",

abstract = "Human capital development, attractions of sustainable living standards and renewed concerns for the planet have redirected city planners to a new frontier: the creation of sustainable cities. This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2% of the earth surface, they however consume 60–80% of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70% of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth-abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities’ planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustainability present in their future project execution.",

abstract = "Global technological advancement as aligned to the fourth industrial revolution supports various first world development needs. Within the African context, and specifically in developing countries like South Africa (SA), the benefit from technology innovation can significantly impact on socio-economic issues like unemployment and skills development. Technological development is identified as a crucial driver for new growth and a means to develop and outperform global competitors. Human capital, specifically young people, supports inclusive and sustainable economic growth. South Africa as per current classification, remains a twofold economy with among the greatest inequality rates in the world, continuing both disparity and segregation. Employment remains at more than one in three youth unemployed. A group of academics and commercial partners working across disciplines collaborate to create opportunities for local young people to participate in research and data gathering at the University of Johannesburg (UJ). The need for the enablement of technology especially among the youth of the African society has initiated a research question, which determines whether technological instruments can be developed and deployed in Africa to facilitate youth. A transformative but collaborative (researcher and community team), approach is the focus with youth employment as a key objective. Collaboration with local communities to gather household and sector specific data, UJ mobilizes cross-disciplinary research networks to drive social innovation. Joining strategies and technologies to develop appropriate, smart digital tools to support technological enablement for survey data collection in the informal sector in South Africa. The team develop a research methodology and digital tools, which enables geographic information systems (GIS) survey data collection over large geographical areas, at scale, which relies on rigorous data quality controls. Providing various opportunities to local young people in the digital, gig-economy through data collection and digital networking. The major perspective of this paper is to study the aspect of technology and the way it empowers young people on the African continent. The paper presents the design, evolution and results of the digital platform as developed for two major South African Projects.",

Apparent effects on both society and individual livelihoods will continue to increase in the coming decades. Great hopes are projected on technology to support solutions for the ageing society and urban planning. Smart city strategies and the field of ambient assisted living are two concepts sharing the assumption that technology will make our lives more independent, more efficient and safer with a higher quality of life. This paper presents a case study of a participatory foresight project that investigates how transdisciplinary agenda setting through the means of including citizens, experts and stakeholders can provide orientation for long-term planning on the future of ageing in the city. Results enforce the argument that urban governance needs to address additional tasks whilst adapting to challenges arising from ageing societies and urbanisation. Alongside mere technological innovation, human factors gain importance. Future-oriented urban development strategies need to incorporate this fact and should not predominantly be drafted on the paradigm of technological progress.",

On the other side, evaluation of ambient services is often a laborious task. This work presents an approach that simplifies the evaluation by making use of two frameworks from robotics to perform tests in simulated smart environments. A method based on the language as action principle is used to extract realistic behavior of people living in real-world smart environments. Using this data, many different scenarios with varying configurations (different floor layouts, numbers and types of sensors, different number of people and pets) can easily be simulated and the performance of the ambient services evaluated.",

The attempts to solve the problem of mobility by using personal transport lead to the growth of automobilization. It is reflected adversely on the security of transport systems of cities. One of the ways to solve this problem is a part of the concept of a Smart City. Smart Mobility is one of the main directions of development of its transport system. At that, together with intellectualization of control one more question is being solved: transfer to more secure, stable and pure types of transport, such as bicycles. Its democratic nature and availability, cheapness and environmental friendliness, and the fact that it promotes the healthy way of life are the reasons of popularity of this transport. At the same time bicyclers, as well as pedestrians, are the least protected category of road users. Measures to ensure the safety of road traffic are usually aimed either at prevention of accidents or, if it’s impossible, at the reduction of severity of consequences. From our point of view the most important thing is developing measures for prevention of road accidents. Organizational and management solutions are often very effective at little cost. Thus, one of such methods is choosing safe routes. At the present time there are multiple navigational systems and route planners. Cartographic information is used in these systems and that helps to construct possible variants of routes between points A and B. However these routes are not assessed from the point of view of their security. At the same time there is statistics of road accidents which gives us the opportunity to find the most dangerous sections of road network. One of the possible system alternatives of assessment of the route security for different types of road traffic participants is described in the article. The developed system is based on multifactorial information analysis. Characteristics of different sections of road network as well as data on road traffic accidents are used for evaluating the levels of security of road sections. Correction factors enable taking into account the peculiarities of each type of road users. The developed algorithm is implemented as a computer application.",

Secondly, emerging developments are discussed to identify the most promising service innovation dynamics. Finally, foresight scenarios demonstrate possible future trends of the new service economy. These scenarios are based on a methodology developed and applied in the context of an EC-funded project on Sectoral Innovation Systems. This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business services and distributive trade services. Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics. The cases of knowledge intensive services and distributive trades have shown how different drivers and emerging developments are interrelated and establish different scenarios for future development.",

abstract = "Taxi is a core component of urban transit systems. Since they can provide more time-saving and convenient service than many other transit options, taxis have a certain passenger base. The analysis of taxi ridership can be used to better understand the travel mobility of passengers and the traffic structure of urban areas. In previous studies, taxi trajectory data have been widely used, especially in exploring taxi ridership, and point-of-interest (POI) data are usually used to evaluate the land-use type of a certain sub-district. On the basis of preceding research, this paper uses taxi trajectory data within the long time scale of one week. Five traffic factors are taken into consideration: pick-ups, drop-offs, and the ratio of pick-ups to drop-offs, pick-up probability and drop-off probability. The research model is divided into weekdays and weekends. For the calculation of probabilities, an index termed the Area Crossing Index is proposed to reflect the taxi cardinality and accessibility of a region. At the same time, POI and demographic data are used as explanatory variables. In this study, we also take the business hours of POIs into consideration. In order to explore the ridership in each hour, hierarchical clustering is used to determine the similarity characteristics of hourly dependent variables. Then, stepwise linear regression is used to screen and evaluate coefficients without collinearity. Finally, geographically weighted regression is adopted to evaluate spatial variability, and the coefficients of common explanatory variables on weekdays and weekends are examined. At the end of this paper, the causes of common explanatory factors on weekdays and weekends for each traffic factor are discussed. This paper also analyzes ridership by combining all the results of dependent variables and proposes some suggestions for taxi scheduling.",

If created, nurtured and enhanced, urban green space can extend the resilience and security of energy, health, water, food, and biodiversity systems.

Performance-based monitoring can evaluate the efficiency of urban green spaces as a measure against heat and water stress. Increasing vulnerability exposes a large number of urban populations and assets to risks.

Despite its potential as a URR tool, the deployment of urban green spaces is quite limited, especially in developing countries. Challenges include a lack of integrated strategies, green-engineering design and instrumented monitoring, management best practices and incentives to change. This article reviews urban green space types and their resilience capacity and proposes the UGS-3CC framework, which is an urban climate resiliency model based on blue-green networking. The framework responds to the design, implementation and management challenges of urban green spaces by using a contextual concept, core competency and contribution calculation.",

abstract = "Increased lifespans and population growth have resulted in an older U.S. society that must reckon with the complex oral health needs that arise as adults age. Understanding accessibility to screening and treatment facilities for older adults is necessary in order to provide them with preventive and restorative services. This study uses an agent-based model to examine the accessibility of screening and treatment facilities via transportation networks for older adults living in the neighborhoods of northern Manhattan, New York City. Older adults are simulated as socioeconomically distinct agents who move along a GIS-based transportation network using transportation modes that mediate their access to screening and treatment facilities. This simulation model includes four types of mobile agents as a simplifying assumption: walk, by car, by bus, or by van (i.e., a form of transportation assistance for older adults). These mobile agents follow particular routes: older adults who travel by car, bus, and van follow street roads, whereas pedestrians follow walkways. The model enables the user to focus on one neighborhood at a time for analysis. The spatial dimension of an older adult's accessibility to screening and treatment facilities is simulated through the travel costs (indicated by travel time or distance) incurred in the GIS-based model environment, where lower travel costs to screening and treatment facilities imply better access. This model provides a framework for representing health-seeking behavior that is contextualized by a transportation network in a GIS environment.",

abstract = "Activity Recognition (AR) is key in context-aware assistive living systems. One challenge in AR is the segmentation of observed sensor events when interleaved or concurrent activities of daily living (ADLs) are performed. Several studies have proposed methods of separating and organising sensor observations and recognise generic ADLs performed in a simple or composite manner. However, little has been explored in semantically distinguishing individual sensor events directly and passing it to the relevant ongoing/new atomic activities. This paper proposes Semiotic theory inspired ontological model, capturing generic knowledge and inhabitant-specific preferences for conducting ADLs to support the segmentation process. A multithreaded decision algorithm and system prototype were developed and evaluated against 30 use case scenarios where each event was simulated at 10sec interval on a machine with i7 2.60GHz CPU, 2 cores and 8GB RAM. The result suggests that all sensor events were adequately segmented with 100% accuracy for single ADL scenarios and minor improvement of 97.8% accuracy for composite ADL scenario. However, the performance has suffered to segment each event with the average classification time of 3971ms and 62183ms for single and composite ADL scenarios, respectively.",

This lasted more than 65 years until the Northeastern Japan earthquake and tsunami induced nuclear crisis of March 2011 brought Japan to an existential crossroads. Instead of implementing its plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity from thirty percent to fifty percent, Japan shut-down all fifty-four nuclear reactors for safety checks and stress-checks (two have since been restarted), resulting in reduced power generation during the summer of 2012. The reconstruction of Northeastern Japan approaches at a time when the world is grappling with a transition to sustainable energy technologies—one that will require substantial investment but one that would result in fundamental changes in infrastructure and energy efficiency. Certain reconstruction methods can be inappropriate in the social, cultural and climatic context of disaster affected areas. Thus, how can practitioners employ sustainable reconstructions which better respond to local housing needs and availability of natural energy resources without a framework in place? This paper aims at sensitizing policy-makers and stakeholders involved in post disaster reconstruction by recognizing advantages of deploying sustainable energy technologies, to reduce dependence of vulnerable communities on external markets.",

The new urban transport policy should concentrate on promotion of environmental friendly vehicles, equal access to public transport modes, better telecommunication services and better goods transport management. The Autonomic Road Transport Support Systems can change the street view: fights congestion by ramp-metering and better traffic distribution on the road network; autonomous cars densely packed when moving; no traffic signals, traffic signs, signposts and road painting; narrower carriageway means more space for bicycle routes, sidewalks, greenery and coffee gardens. Multifunctional and Intensive Land Use should be promoted to reduce travel needs or to make travel distances smaller (acceptable for walking or cycling). MILU will help also with urban sprawl – higher density means people are not car dependent. My Smart Eco-travel Planner and its database can be used for implementing sustainable urban transport policy in more efficient way. The main financial source for promotion of eco-friendly travel modes could be a transport policy rule: fuel prices can never go down – probably more effective measure than all Climate Summit 2015 results. Only during last 3 years changes in fuel price could result in Poland in gathering ca. 10bn € on the eco-fund for financing e.g. the new metro lines. Business Model (showing the cities their potential gains in result of above measures implementation) will help the cities authorities to vote for the new way of mobility management. Financial Div. of the City Transport Dpt. will calculate gains of the lower car use: lower costs of road construction and maintenance, new work places, shorter travel times, better environment, better inhabitants health and the Green City image – minus costs of the new system implementation. Measures mentioned above shape the new paradigm of urban transport management.",

Les réflexions et les recherches sur les enjeux éthiques des gérontechnologies ont été et sont toujours très nombreuses. En France, les gérontechnologies ont très vite été uniquement associées à la dépendance et réduites aux potentielles réponses qu’elles pouvaient y apporter. Elles ont souffert des représentations de la vieillesse véhiculées au départ de leur diffusion et peinent à dépasser une approche ciblée et stigmatisante. L’approche tend toutefois a s’élargir et a s’appuyer sur un nouveau paradigme, le même que celui qu’on observe au niveau des politiques publiques, caractérise par le passage d’une vision de la vieillesse centrée sur les incapacités a une vision du vieillissement comme processus différencie.
Summary
Reflection and research on the ethical issues pertaining to the gerontechnologies have been widespread. In France, gerontechnologies were in the early stages solely associated with dependency, and reduced to the possible answers that they could provide in the setting of the loss of autonomy. Gerontechnologies have been hampered by representations of old age at the time of their initiation and there is difficulty in overcoming an excessively targeted and stigmatizing approach. However, this approach is tending to broaden, building on a new paradigm, the same paradigm as that observed in public policies towards ageing, characterized by a shift from a disability-centered view of old age to a view of ageing as a differentiated process.",

abstract = "In this paper, energy-efficient scheduling and grouping for battery-driven machine-type devices in cellular networks is investigated. We introduce a scheduling-based cooperation incentive scheme which enables machine nodes to organize themselves locally, create machine groups, and communicate through group representatives to the base station. This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which takes into account the cooperation level of each node, reimburses the extra energy consumptions of group representatives, and maximizes the network lifetime. As reusing cellular uplink resources for communications inside the groups degrades the Quality of Service (QoS) of the primary users, analytical results are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number of simultaneously active machine groups in a given cell and QoS of the primary users. Furthermore, we extend our derived solutions for the existing cellular networks, propose a cooperation-incentive LTE scheduler, and present our simulation results in the context of LTE. The simulation results show that the proposed solutions significantly prolong the network lifetime. Also, it is shown that under certain circumstances, reusing uplink resource by machine devices can degrade the outage performance of the primary users significantly, and hence, coexistence management of machine devices and cellular users is of paramount importance for next generations of cellular networks in order to enable group-based machine-type communications while guaranteeing QoS for the primary users.",

abstract = "Urban resilience is being increasingly recognized by scholars as the approach to healthier and more sustainable cities facing various challenges. Among the characteristics of urban resilience, there is a wide consensus that the capability of capital building for local areas is an indispensable attribute. Based upon this understanding, this paper takes the example of Kesennuma City, a small coastal town in Miyagi Prefecture of Japan that was severely damaged by the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (EJET), to illustrate how the pursuit of building local capital was incorporated into the agenda of its reconstruction planning. The research relies on the on-site field work together with meetings of local stakeholders and the analysis of various documents and reports. Kesennuma City, facing problems of declining fishery industry, long-time depopulation and severe tsunami damages, has been vigorously exploring for new approaches of diversifying its economy and sustaining its future development, as reflected in the goals of the city's reconstruction plan devised in October of 2011, and other machi-zukuri projects. Besides, the evidence of capital building is also discovered in the planning process with high degree of involvement from and cooperation between various stakeholders, including the government, citizens, NGOs and incoming wisdoms, such as universities. In regard of this, this paper scrutinizes the agenda of reconstruction plans together with their functioning mechanisms. It finally concludes with the lessons from this specific case to similar cities with limited resources that face challenges of building local capitals.",

abstract = "The growth of projects translating the concept of eco-city into practices has accelerated during the last fifteen years, making the eco-city a global phenomenon. Asia in particular has witnessed notable developments, characterized by strong governmental intervention and national initiatives to create model eco-cities. In Japan, the central government launched an “Eco-Model Cities” program in 2008 and has designated twenty-three model cities. In China, hundreds of municipalities have pursued plans to become an eco- or low-carbon city following the government’s demonstration projects. Across East Asia, the eco-city is promoted as an innovative urban policy capable of advancing the agendas of sustainable urbanization and the realignment of the post-industrial urban economy. This paper compares the policies and strategies of developing eco-cities in Japan and China using Kitakyushu and Tianjin Eco-city as case studies. It examines these cities’ common and contrasting approaches to ecological urbanism, their respective technological and urban design strategies, the relationship between eco-city building and local economic development, and the roles played by different stakeholders in this effort. The research focuses on their Key Performance Indicator systems and the spatial qualities they anticipate, which reflect fundamentally different ideas about what societal role an eco-city should best play. The comparative method sheds light on debates around important aspects of planning and managing an eco-city––namely, between new town and retrofit development, between top-down directive and bottom-up force, and between the eco-city as technology and as culture. This paper thus offers critical insight into the changing notions of urbanity within Asian society.",

It proposes and tests a new theoretical model called the combined methodological approach (CMA). The backbone of this model is an often-overlooked qualitative, bottom-up-driven, slow, small and deep-data-oriented ethnographic research, combined with components or phases of post-occupancy evaluation and behavioural mapping as two user-oriented techniques for assessing usage-space relationships. The paper is rather theoretical, as it focuses on the argumentation of different approaches in city planning, design and governance. However, tests of the proposed model were conducted in public open spaces of four pilot cases in two European cities (Maribor and Ljubljana, in Slovenia). The proposed CMA was tested against its applicability to real urban environments. The results, in accordance with the methodology used, showed that such a combination of often closely related, overlapping and complementary techniques can significantly enhance the understanding of complex relations and interactions between people, space and technology within the city. Hence, it can empower stakeholders towards more informative and responsive measures – and, finally, more inclusive, individualized, tailor-made cities.",

The main local input and output flows are analysed for each municipality by considering available databases. Urban performance is investigated in the research framework of urban metabolism, by applying a fuzzy logic model. The overall structure of the model, definition of subsystems, set of indicators, adopted benchmarks, and levels of importance of variables are calibrated to suit the particular context of applications. The model provides the UEI (urban efficiency index) outcome and a geographical information system (GIS) representation to facilitate the comparison between municipalities and territories and determine the low or high-performance areas that necessitate further investigations. This work represents an important attempt in developing and applying methods for supporting decisions and defining policies towards more sustainable urban areas.",

abstract = "Rising population, income and urbanization are increasing urban passenger transport demand in India. Energy and emissions intensities associated with conventional transport are no longer sustainable vis-a-vis energy security, air quality and climate change. Cities are seeking transport roadmaps that jointly mitigate these risks. Roadmaps vary across cities, but approach to delineate actions is common: (i) ‘representative vision’ that articulates long-term goals, (ii) methods for comparative scenarios assessment, and (iii) quantification of co-benefits to prioritize actions. This paper illustrates application of quantitative modeling to assess development and environmental co-benefits for Ahmedabad city. The paper constructs two transport scenarios spanning till 2035. The bifurcating themes are: (i) Business-as-Usual (BAU) and Low Carbon Scenario (LCS). The quantitative assessment using Extended Snapshot (ExSS) Model shows that transport activity shall result in four-fold increase in energy demand under BAU from 2010 to 2035. Three key contributors to CO2 mitigation under LCS in merit order are: (i) fuel switch, including decarbonized electricity, (ii) modal shift, and (iii) substitution of travel demand. Scenarios analysis shows that LCS improves energy security by reducing oil demand and also delivers air quality co-benefits – reducing 74% NOx and 83% PM2.5 from the passenger transport sector compared to BAU in 2035. Finally, the paper argues that cities in developing countries can leverage carbon finance to develop sustainable and low carbon mobility plans that prevent adverse infrastructure and behavioral lock-ins and prompt low carbon development.",

In this paper, based on GPS data and Smart Card data of buses in Qingdao, the two cohorts' basic spatio-temporal travel patterns in aspects of travel distance, travel frequency and travel start time in weekday and weekend are compared. In addition, directed weighted networks of elderly's trips and younger people's trips in weekday and weekend are constructed for analyzing spatial characteristics. Results show that although the number of elderly experiences a reduction on weekend their travel frequency and travel distance show growth on weekend. In contrast with younger people, larger geospatial expansion of elderly's travel on weekend is observed. Elderly are found to prefer traveling in areas with high elderly people's residential density. Our study provides a deeper and nuanced understanding of elderly's spatio-temporal travel characteristics difference between weekday and weekend, so as to support better traffic policy making and the promotion on age-friendly public transport service.",

Thus, there is an increasing demand, from both social and healthcare systems, for instruments and strategies to recognize cognitive decline, and possibly distinguish the precursor of serious neurodegeneration from “benign senile forgetfulness” or the temporary consequences of illness or trauma. However, this goal faces both technical and ethical issues. In this article we deal with the following: (i) re-definition of cognitive decline and its relationship with frailty definitions, starting from the recent work of international consensus groups for presymptomatic Alzheimer disease recognition; (ii) ethical problems concerning anonymous and personalized cognitive screening and the need for appropriate counselling; (iii) the need for more sensitive and specific tools to detect and distinguish pathological levels of cognitive decline and delineate the contribution of non-pathological decline to accumulated frailty impacts and (iv) the potential of the language domain and spontaneous speech analyses.",

It uses a structured FTA approach to offer guidance for the design of foresight exercises supporting such priority setting, drawing on the case of S&T cooperation between EU Member States, countries associated to the FP7, and Russia. A framework is proposed for thematic priority setting through the application of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) and for achieving clear policy impacts by including principles for impact optimisation. A combination of foresight methodologies such as expert workshops, a Delphi survey, roadmapping elements, and prioritisation techniques was applied to select relevant topics for a joint research call. The paper shows how foresight can be embedded in a multilateral S&T programme cooperation using a set of coordination dimensions and design principles. Strategies for achieving policy impact and for communicating foresight results are also outlined. Future research is proposed to further improve guidance to facilitate more global research programme cooperation in the future to jointly address global challenges.",

abstract = "It is commonly argued that cities face unprecedented pressures and therefore must transform. To guide transformations, it is important to develop guiding visions. This paper reports on a futures thinking exercise in the context of cities. It employs a methodology based on a series of community workshops with a diverse mix of experts using a “strategic conversation”. The conversation was framed around the question: ‘How might your city build and maintain resilience in a range of plausible futures?’ Results of the process help to identify risks and opportunities, as well as urban transformation archetypes. Furthermore, these narratives are interpreted as city reorganization patterns similar to those theorized in resilience thinking through the notion of adaptive cycles. Finally, the possibility of developing a more functional transformation narrative for cities is outlined, which would enable the development of a collective vision for a desired urban future and how to avoid the adverse consequences of drivers of change in cities.",

abstract = "Urbanization directly drives rural to urban population migration and indirectly causes west to east migration in China, two phenomena that may significantly impact China's greenhouse gas emissions given its huge population and vast difference between the west rural and east urban areas. We analyzed these two phenomena by turning emissions into a per capita term, and extending the impact from the traditional urbanization rate effect to include population density effect. Our results show that population density has actually been the dominant demographic player in changing per capita emissions for the past two decades in China, and its elasticity changed from positive in economically less-developed provinces to negative for the developed provinces. This study therefore provides a new perspective in the study of the relationship between urbanization and greenhouse gas emissions, and our results indicate that population density change should be taken into account to accurately assess the impact of urbanization.",

abstract = "In recent years, multiple transformative initiatives have been set up in cities across the world to kick-start transitions of urban systems towards sustainability. Yet to what extent do these initiatives influence systemic change or accelerate sustainability transitions? We apply an analytical framework, conceptualizing five mechanisms representing acceleration dynamics of sustainability transitions – replicating, partnering, upscaling, instrumentalising and embedding – to examine transition dynamics in the Belgian City of Genk. The focal unit of analysis are the innovative activities and related actor-networks from the city region, defined as ‘transition initiatives’, situated within the local governance context. We selected 10 local transition initiatives with a clear focus on environmental sustainability and set out to understand their origins and identify conditions and mechanisms for accelerating sustainable low-carbon transitions. Our findings show that all five mechanisms of acceleration are occurring in Genk at the moment and that the local governance context is favourable for accelerating transition dynamics to sustainability, mostly because it promotes diffusion, partnering and embedding processes. For instance, one initiative that proved to be a hotspot for partnering is the Heempark, a Public-Civic Partnership in which volunteers and the government collaborate in a mutually beneficial way. Our findings provide early indications of mounting changes, increasing reflexivity and coordination from governance actors and diffusion, embedding and routinisation of more sustainable ways of thinking, doing and organising in the wider public. These acceleration dynamics are most apparent in the food, nature, resource and education domain in Genk and are mostly fuelled via multi-actor collaborations. On an aggregate level, these observations suggest that socio-cultural, economic, ecological and institutional changes are accumulating. We therefore conclude that early but fragile acceleration dynamics are unfolding in Genk. Our findings are relevant to deepen the understanding of transition scholars on the acceleration dynamics of urban sustainability transitions and may be of particular interest for practitioners on the field.",

The features of a complexity theory of cities have been developed at multiple levels with scientific analogies such as ecology, biology and physics. The following principles apply: (1) complexity science unifies a wide variety of urban phenomena including emergence, technological evolution, civil phase transitions, macrolaws, and resilience to system failures and extreme events. (2). World urbanisation raises the number of levels in the urban hierarchy, with an increasing number of megacities with over 10m inhabitants. (3) Urban development involves the institutional coordination of technological development with engineered transformations. (4) Civil and societal transitions arise with increasing per capita investment, such that some social norms and planning standards have consistent scaling factors across a range of city sizes for countries at similar stages of development. (5) The trajectory of the urban system depends upon the allometric pattern of growth for cities, and human settlements in 2150 will occupy less than 10% of the world's land area.",

However, with the increasing population and consumption in the city, the increasing environmental risks continually flow into the local social-economic-ecological system (SEES) through ecological intercorrelation from neighborhoods, so that the thresholds of risks challenge the urban resilience of Beijing and the surrounding area. Thereby, we analyze the 139 selected indicators to deeply understand the systematic risks across temporal scale during 1978–2015 in Beijing. Results show the development pathway of Beijing experienced three stages from “entrance”, “soar” to “coursing”. In the current new stage, the ecological impacts and resource use per capita are main constrains to future development in Beijing. This implies to a framework of urban growth for a demonstration pilot path of eco-urbanization in five aspects: 1) strategic clarification of the growth space; 2) design the urban growth path based on ecosystem planning with functional landscape architecture; 3) higher standards of industrial establishments with advanced environmental assessment and monitoring; 4) construction of environmental infrastructures with smart resource recycling; and 5) based on strict implementation of institutions and regulations to maximize the function of market allocation.",

abstract = "The Integrated Multimodal Travel Information (IMTI) plays an important role in the evolution process of holiday travel behaviour, which is seldom investigated. To fill this gap, this study analyses holiday travel behaviour dynamics with IMTI usage, based on the life-oriented approach. IMTI usage is taken as a separate life domain in this study, and a two-way relationship between holiday travel biography and IMTI usage biography over the life course, is examined after controlling for the effects of residential, household structure, employment/education, and car ownership biographies. Based on the web-based life history survey data, statistical characteristics of mobilities in each life biography are first analysed. Then, different random-effects ordered logistic models are established to investigate the biographical interdependencies from three aspects: intra-domain interdependency, inter-domain interdependency and outer-domain interdependency. The results show that the life biography is not only affected by a personal life course, but also affected by external background of the times. Under the interaction of inner individual factors and outer environment factors, there is an obvious dynamic two-way relationship between holiday travel biography and IMTI usage biography. Meanwhile, residential, household structure, employment/education and car ownership biographies have significant effects on these two life biographies. Especially, the influence of long-term state dependence for different life domains, over the life course, is much more obvious when explaining holiday travel behaviour dynamics and IMTI usage mobilities. Therefore, the life-oriented approach provides a valid method for analysing the dynamics of holiday travel behaviour with IMTI usage.",

abstract = "Localizing and tracking human movement in a device-free and passive manner is promising in two aspects: i) it neither requires users to wear any sensors or devices, ii) nor it needs them to consciously cooperate during the localization. Such indoor localization technique underpins many real-world applications such as shopping navigation, intruder detection, surveillance care of seniors etc. However, current passive localization techniques either need expensive/sophisticated hardware such as ultra-wideband radar or infrared sensors, or have an issue of invasion of privacy such as camera-based techniques, or need regular maintenance such as the replacement of batteries. In this paper, we build a novel data-driven localization and tracking system upon a set of commercial ultra-high frequency passive radio-frequency identification tags in an indoor environment. Specifically, we formulate human localization problem as finding a location with the maximum posterior probability given the observed received signal strength indicator from passive radio-frequency identification tags. In this regard, we design a series of localization schemes to capture the posterior probability by taking the advance of supervised-learning models including Gaussian Mixture Model, k Nearest Neighbor and Kernel-based Learning. For tracking a moving target, we mathematically model the task as searching a location sequence with the most likelihood, in which we first augment the probabilistic estimation learned in localization to construct the Emission Matrix and propose two human mobility models to approximate the Transmission Matrix in the Hidden Markov Model. The proposed tracking model is able to transfer the pattern learned in localization into tracking but also reduce the location-state candidates at each transmission iteration, which increases both the computation efficiency and tracking accuracy. The extensive experiments in two real-world scenarios reveal that our approach can achieve up to 94% localization accuracy and an average 0.64 m tracking error, outperforming other state-of-the-art radio-frequency identification based indoor localization systems.",
