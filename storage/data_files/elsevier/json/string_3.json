		"abstract": "One of the most critical issues in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is the design of systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and health conditions change. Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, an ever increasing range of technology-based applications have been developed with the goal of assisting in the delivery of more effective and efficient fall prevention interventions. Whilst there have been a number of studies that have surveyed technologies for a particular sub-domain of fall prevention, there is no existing research which surveys the full spectrum of falls prevention interventions and characterises the range of technologies that have augmented this landscape. This study presents a conceptual framework and survey of the state of the art of technology-based fall prevention systems which is derived from a systematic template analysis of studies presented in contemporary research literature. The framework proposes four broad categories of fall prevention intervention system: Pre-fall prevention; Post-fall prevention; Fall injury prevention; Cross-fall prevention. Other categories include, Application type, Technology deployment platform, Information sources, Deployment environment, User interface type, and Collaborative function. After presenting the conceptual framework, a detailed survey of the state of the art is presented as a function of the proposed framework. A number of research challenges emerge as a result of surveying the research literature, which include a need for: new systems that focus on overcoming extrinsic falls risk factors; systems that support the environmental risk assessment process; systems that enable patients and practitioners to develop more collaborative relationships and engage in shared decision making during falls risk assessment and prevention activities. In response to these challenges, recommendations and future research directions are proposed to overcome each respective challenge.",

We highlight the novelties and challenges of the way in which these projects seek to tackle the current crisis of care through different forms of self-fabrication of “open” and “low cost” technical aids. We analyse them as forms of “critical making” expanding the repertoire of independent-living and disabled peoples rights politics to the experimentation with technological production. Through the deployment of an empirical example of the prototyping process by the Barcelona-based activist design collective En torno a la silla, we show how open prototyping constitutes a major challenge for the radicalisation of the independent-living movements precepts of control and choice, displaying the matter of care arrangements and making available its transformation. Résumé Dans cet article, nous réfléchissons empiriquement sur certaines tentatives collectives d’intervention dans le care pour et par les personnes handicapées en période d’austérité en Espagne.

		"abstract": "The objective of the study was to develop a conceptual framework of key assessment areas for the evaluation of rehabilitation outcomes in older persons. The study was designed in four stages. First, a review of the literature generated a list of 84 potential outcome variables. Second, semi-structured interviews were conducted with older adults informants (n=19) to record their thoughts about important rehabilitation outcomes. From the analyses of the transcripts, 20 recurrent themes became apparent. Third, relevant assessment areas were determined based on the merged data from the literature and the interviews. Fourth, a focus group was held with a panel of eight interdisciplinary experts with strong involvement in geriatric rehabilitation to evaluate, improve, and validate the preliminary work. As a result of the study, the conceptual framework for the assessment of geriatric rehabilitation outcomes (FAGRO) is composed of four primary outcome domains related to important activities for community-living older persons: mobility activities, basic activities of daily living, activities of independent living, and leisure activities. The models also allows for four brief evaluations of underlying functioning components, including: physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, and factors related to the caregiver status and available resources. The model has the potential to become a valuable additional tool for outcome assessment, researched and developed specifically for geriatric rehabilitation.",

		"abstract": "Health care is consuming an ever larger share of national resources in the United States. Measures to contain costs and evidence of unexplained variation in patient outcomes have led to concern about inadequacy in the quality of health care. As a measure of quality, the evaluation of hospitals through analysis of their discharge databases has been suggested because of the scope and economy offered by this methodology. However, the value of the information obtained through these analyses has been questioned because of the inadequacy of the clinical data contained in administrative databases and the resultant inability to control accurately for patient variation. We suggest, however, that the major shortcoming of prior attempts to use large databases to perform across-facility evaluation has resulted from the lack of a conceptual framework to guide the analysis. We propose a framework which identifies component areas and clarifies the underlying assumptions of the analytic process. For each area, criteria are identified which will maximize the validity of the results. Hospitals identified as having unexpectedly high unfavorable outcomes when our framework is applied will be those where poor quality will most likely be found by primary review of the process of care. We outline the following criteria for the selection of disease-outcome pairs to be studied in large administrative database analysis: (1) disease entities or clinical states selected should be well defined and easily diagnosed; (2) if diagnostic classification systems are used, disease groups should be homogeneous as to the clinical states they contain; (3) the disease entities should be prevalent; (4) a plausible link should exist between the quality (process) of care and the frequency of the outcome; (5) types of care which conform to acceptable practice standards but still lead to variation in the outcome of interest should be excluded from the analysis; (6) the outcomes should be prevalent; (7) constraints of the ICD-9 coding system should be understood such that only those disease-outcome pairs least affected by these limitations are selected for analysis; (8) constraints of the structure of the database should be considered when the analysis is performed; and (9) disease-outcome pairs should be chosen where there is agreement on the processes of care that affect the outcome of interest, either favorably or unfavorably.",

By integrating previously developed scales measuring different domains of disability (ADL, IADL, and mobility) and the use of a four-category response format, an accurate and detailed measure of disability can be obtained and a broader range of needs of subjects can be described. The GARS manual, including detailed procedures for administration and scoring, encourages unambiguous administration and interpretation which results in more comparable research outcomes.",

		"abstract": "A conceptual framework is presented for classifying the outcomes of services for sufferers of severe mental disorders. The proposed classification framework contains three dimensions: (a) the respondent type; (b) the social context; and (c) the domain of treatment outcomes. Respondent types include the client, the family, the extended social network, the clinician and the scientist. Social contexts include the individual, the family, work/school and the broader community. Domains of treatment outcome include “clinical status,” “functional status,” “life satisfaction and fulfillment,” and “safety and welfare.” This multidimensional framework is used to organize an illustrative review of existing outcome measures. It is concluded that: (a) measures of safety and welfare raise important social and policy questions and these measures require considerable development in order for utility to be realized; (b) although a good beginning has been made, more attention needs to be focused on defining and measuring “life satisfaction and fulfillment” and combining this domain with others to produce “well being” or “quality of life” scales; (c) the functional status area requires additional research and development especially when measurement is conducted in contexts other than work/school; and (d) although measures of clinical status are relatively well developed, the family perspective and context must be integrated into these measures.",

Design Systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies. Data sources We searched six bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts), with no limits on publication date. Eligible studies reported peer-reviewed qualitative research on experiences of aging in place in the United States with full-text available in English. Review methods Three reviewers independently used Covidence software to screen titles and abstracts followed by full texts. We assessed quality and risk of bias using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Qualitative Research. Qualitative data analysis was conducted using meta-ethnography, following Noblit and Hares seven-step method of translation and synthesis to generate a novel conceptual model. Results Of 2659 papers screened, 37 unique studies were eligible for inclusion, reported in 38 publications. The studies were conducted in 16 states and published between 1994 and 2018. The included samples represented 1199 participants in total, with mean ages ranging from 48 to 91 years. The gender of the samples ranged from 20% to 100% female, with a median of 77%. One-third of the included studies did not report participants’ race/ethnicity, and half of the remaining study samples were at least 90% white; however, 20% of the studies focused exclusively on experiences of racial/ethnic minority older adults. Using meta-ethnography, we developed a new conceptual model of aging in place in the United States as a dynamic process of balancing threats and agency in relation to experiences of identity, connectedness, and place. We found that people aging in place were engaged in significant work to cope with unpredictable needs and challenges by changing their mindset, adapting their home environment to accommodate new needs, and finding different ways to connect with important people in their lives. Agency was shaped by resources and restrictions on choice, and where threats to aging in place outweighed an individuals sense of agency, the consequences included feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and dislocation. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of qualitative studies to evaluate experiences of aging in place in the United States. The findings of our meta-ethnographic synthesis led to the development of a new conceptual model of aging in place highlighting the dynamic tensions involved in balancing threats and agency.",

A sample of 66 (32 females) adolescents in foster care in Israel ages 16–18 were interviewed face to face. In addition, their social workers completed a structured questionnaire to report on the adolescents background and current functioning. Overall, adolescents presented a positive view of their readiness in most areas. They felt less ready mainly in their abilities to secure financial resources for school and housing. Background variables and workers reports did not predict readiness. Youths perceptions of relationships with foster family, social support, educational achievements and the avoidance of substance abuse were correlated positively with perceived readiness. The discussion examines the potential positive and negative implications of an optimistic view of readiness and presents implications for practice. Policy implications are suggested for preparing youth while in care and after they leave care.",

Main Outcome Measures An audit of time frames between injury, assessment, and surgery for people with tetraplegia was undertaken. Interviews of people with tetraplegia were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory. Results Sixty-two percent of people with tetraplegia assessed for surgery had upper limb reconstructive surgery. Most were assessed within the first 3 years of spinal cord injury. Over half had surgery within 4 years after injury; however, 20% waited >10 years. Changes in prioritized activities, and the identification of tasks possible with surgery, were influential in the decision-making process. Participants were aware of surgery, but required a reoffer from health professionals before proceeding. The influence of peers was prominent in reinforcing the improvement in prioritized activities possible after surgery. Conclusions Findings confirmed that the previously developed conceptual framework for decision-making about upper limb reconstructive surgery was applicable for people with tetraplegia of >10 years. Similarities were seen in the influence of goals and priorities (although the nature of these might change) and information from peers (although this influence was greater for those injured longer).

This paper reports upon a systematic literature review, compiling research on AVs against wider theory on the travel behaviours of older people. A conceptual framework of policy interactions is devised, and corresponding scenarios of potential mobility politics are presented. It is concluded that the implications of AVs for older people are likely to be varied and, importantly, will be influenced by policy responses.",

		"abstract": "Background Demonstration programs nationwide aim to control costs and improve care for people dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, including many persons with disability. Ensuring these initiatives maintain or improve care quality requires comprehensive evaluation of quality of care. Objectives To examine whether the common quality measures being used to evaluate the Massachusetts One Care duals demonstration program comprehensively address the concerns of persons with disability. Methods Drawing upon existing conceptual frameworks, we developed a model of interrelationships of personal, health care, and environmental factors for achieving wellness for persons with disability. Based on this model, we specified a scheme to code individual quality measurement items and coded the items contained in 12 measures being used to assess Massachusetts One Care, which exclusively enrolls non-elderly adults with disability. Results Across these 12 measures, we assigned 376 codes to 302 items; some items received two codes. Taken together, the 12 measures contain items addressing most factors in our conceptual model that affect health care quality for persons with disability, including long-term services and supports. Some important gaps exist. No items examine sexual or reproductive health care, peer support, housing security, disability stigmatization, and specific services obtained outside the home like adult day care. Certain key concepts are covered only by a single or several of the 12 quality measures. Conclusions Common quality metrics cover most – although not all—health care quality concerns of persons with disability. However, multiple different quality measures are required for this comprehensive coverage, raising questions about respondent burden.",

The internet of things (IoT) emerged as a disruptive and transformative new technology that could potentially stimulate development of new innovative assisted living health and care services. In this paper, we argue that as the human agency and relationship intrinsically associated with care get transferred to the material agency of smart technology, value and trust should be a vital consideration for designing such services. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from the literature on services innovation, design science and trust in relation to healthcare technologies, we present a conceptual framework that articulates various levels of trust among the concerned stakeholders in the service ecosystem and suggests value-sensitive design considerations, anchored on the principles of trust, for future IoT-enabled assistive care services.",

		"abstract": "Background The 1999 John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Act expanded a federal funding stream for independent living/transition services for older youth (ages 14+) in and transitioning from foster care. As a result, there has been a proliferation of programs that target youth who are likely to age out of foster care with the intention of improving their emerging adulthood outcomes. These programs aim to improve wellbeing outcomes related to education, employment, housing, health/mental health, and relationships. Using a scoping review framework, we sought to take stock of the state of the science of the programs and interventions (PIs) currently available for young people who age out of foster care. We offer research recommendations regarding how the field can move forward with promoting improved wellbeing of young people in care as they transition to adulthood. We assess to what extent both services for young people aging out of care and related research has included vulnerable populations, including pregnant/parenting youth, LGBTQ + youth, youth of color, youth with disabilities, and crossover youth. Method Using the National Governors Association’s Center for Best Practices (2010) as a guide, we searched the research and gray literatures for PIs that target education, employment, housing, health/mental health, and relationships. Then, we searched the research and gray literatures for evidence of effectiveness in the form of peer-reviewed scientific articles and evaluation reports. Next, based on the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse (CEBC) for Child Welfare’s Scientific Rating Scale, we assigned each PI a rating (1 = Well-Supported by Research Evidence, 2 = Supported by Research Evidence, 3 = Promising Research Evidence, 4 = Failure to Demonstrate Effect, and 5 = Concerning Practice). Findings Of the 79 PIs we found, 10 (13%) yielded a rating from 1 to 5. The best rating in any of the five practice areas was a 2 (“Supported by Research Evidence”), which applied to four programs. The area with the most rated programs was relationships, with four programs receiving a rating. The area with the least PIs was health/mental health care, with only a single program receiving a rating. Regarding vulnerable populations, 64 programs targeted at least one of the vulnerable populations of interest; 10 (16%) were rated with the CEBC Scale. Implications When the Foster Care Independence Act was passed, there was a dearth of PIs that targeted the wellbeing of older youth in foster care who were likely to age out. In the last 20 years, we have done an excellent job developing PIs. Given the results of this scoping review, we must now build the evidence for the PIs that already exist. This process entails ensuring agencies are equipped with the capacities to implement PIs to fidelity and that procedures are in place to examine the effectiveness for the many PIs that are already being delivered to marginalized young people who age out of care. Special attention should also be devoted to testing the efficacy and effectiveness of existing PIs for vulnerable populations, as their experiences have not been adequately illuminated by previous research.",

		"abstract": "Objective Institutional entry or long-term care (LTC) is an important area to investigate owing to global aging. This study examines which types of disabilities lead to institutionalization for older White and Black women in the United States. Methods Using the 3-year (2009–2011) American Community Survey cross-sectional data, this study applies semi-nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation methods to examine the association between disability and institutional entry on a sample of 222,562 older White women and 19,229 older Black women. This approach provides consistent estimators because no assumptions are made about the distribution of the error terms. Results For older White women, the risk of entering LTC is high in the presence of self-care and independent living difficulties (1.10 [p < .01] and 0.54 [p < .01], respectively). For older Black women, the risk of entering LTC is elevated in the presence of self-care difficulty and cognitive impairment (1.56 [p < .01] and 0.48 [p < .01], respectively) but widowed/divorced/separated marital states do not show this association. Conclusions Disability, marital status, and race are important considerations for assessing the risk of institutional entry. Impairments that limit personal hygiene and self-care are associated with increased risk for older women. Additionally, limitations that affect reasoning and memory are associated with increased risk for older Black women.",

There remains a fundamental need for assessment of sociocultural issues that have been linked with the expectations, needs, and goals of culturally diverse consumers with severe and persistent mental illness. The authors posit that embedding the assessment of sociocultural issues into psychosocial rehabilitation practice is one step in designing culturally relevant empirically supported practices. It becomes a foundation on which practitioners can examine the relevance of their interventions to the diversity encountered in everyday practice. This paper provides an overview of the need for culturally and clinically relevant assessment practices and asserts that by improving the assessment of sociocultural issues the clinical competence of service providers is enhanced. The authors offer a conceptual framework for linking clinical assessment of sociocultural issues to consumer outcomes and introduce an assessment tool adapted to facilitate the process in psychosocial rehabilitation settings. Emphasizing competent clinical assessment skills will ultimately offer a strategy to address disparities in treatment outcomes for understudied populations of culturally diverse consumers with severe and persistent mental illness.",

In fourteen integrated care sites in Europe, plans to improve existing ways of working were designed, implemented and evaluated to enlarge the understanding of what works and with what outcomes when improving integrated care. This paper provides insight into the existing ways that the sites were working with respect to integrated care, their perceived difficulties and their plans for working towards improvement. The seven components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model provided a conceptual framework for describing the fourteen sites. Although sites were spread across Europe and differed in basic characteristics and existing ways of working, a number of difficulties in delivering integrated care were similar. Existing ways of working and improvement plans mostly focused on three components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model: delivery system design; decision support; self-management. Two components were represented less frequently in existing ways of working and improvement plans: building healthy public policy; building community capacity. These findings suggest that broadly-based prevention efforts, population health promotion and community involvement remain limited. From the Expanded Chronic Care Model perspective, therefore, opportunities for improving integrated care outcomes may continue to be restricted by the narrow focus of developed improvement plans.",

In conjunction with the advent of personal health records, tracking personal health using self-monitoring technologies shows promising patient support opportunities.

Methods We conducted three focus groups with health care providers (n=10) and four focus groups with community-dwelling older adults (n=31). Results Older adult participants’ found the concept of self-monitoring unfamiliar and this influenced a narrowed interest in the use of wellness self-monitoring tools. On the other hand, health care provider participants showed open attitudes toward wellness monitoring tools for older adults and brainstormed about various stakeholders’ use cases. The two participant groups showed diverging perceptions in terms of: perceived uses, stakeholder interests, information ownership and control, and sharing of wellness monitoring tools.

		"abstract": "Introduction OTC medications are generally considered safe and convenient to use without requiring a prescription. However, the safety of an OTC medication and the final health outcome depends in part upon consumers’ perceptions, beliefs, and their decision-making about OTC medication use. This study uses a qualitative approach to explore the knowledge, beliefs, and practices associated with OTC medication use and decision-making in adults aged 65 years and older. Methods A set of focus groups (N = 10) were conducted in a sample of independently living older adult residents of senior apartment buildings (N = 80) using purposeful sampling. All focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed qualitatively. Results Most participants considered OTC medications safe and effective to use if following the drug label instructions appropriately. Brand name products were perceived as equally or more effective compared to generic products by participants. Two approaches to OTC treatment decision-making were observed: 1) a decision to treat their symptoms by themselves (self-recommended) or 2) a decision to ask and/or follow their physicians recommendation (physician-recommended). Each of these treatment approaches may lead to the other depending on the persons financial and healthcare resources, the severity of the symptoms, experiences with the medication, and relationship with the physician. Maximum and fast relief was mentioned as the most important attribute in the final OTC purchase decision, followed by the lower cost, and easy to swallow dosage forms. Aspirin and ibuprofen were the two most frequently reported OTC medications associated with adverse effects and inappropriate use. Conclusions Older adults, in general, feel positive about OTC medications and are satisfied with using them. Considering the self-reported malpractices and side effects associated with OTC medications, older adults should be encouraged to make safe and responsible decisions about self-medication.",

		"abstract": "Previously proposed models of intake regulation focus on specific variables thought to influence overall intake, and include factors involved in negative feedback loops with intake as well as genetic influences on intake. Recent evidence, however, suggests that these models although informative, are incomplete. They cannot account for the observations of prolonged and increasing deviations from defended levels, weakness and transitoriness of compensatory responses, the presence of powerful factors that are not compensated, and behavioral genetic data suggesting that there are a wide variety of independent genetic influences on numerous factors that influence intake. As a result we propose a new general model of intake regulation in which intake is influenced by both a set of uncompensated factors that are not influenced by intake and by a set of compensated factors that are. The preferred levels of intake and both sets of factors are specified as influenced by heredity. Further, the model includes impact factors, weights, which specify the magnitude of the effect each factor has on intake. The weights are assumed to be different for different individuals and their values are determined by heredity. A computer simulation of the new model demonstrated that it maintains different levels depending upon the external and internal environments, that changes in these environments result in new levels, and that inherited individual differences in responsiveness to these factors can markedly influence the levels obtained. The proposed general model appears to fit existing knowledge and is parsimonious and widely applicable. Future work should be directed to testing the general model and further developing specific models within the conceptual framework employing known physiological systems and uncompensated stimuli.",

Age-standardized disability prevalence differs markedly by state, from 12.9% in North Dakota and Minnesota to 23.5% in West Virginia. Disability was lower in states with stronger economic output, more income equality, longer histories of tax credits for low-income workers, and higher cigarette taxes (for middle-age women), net of individuals socio-demographic characteristics.

Objective This review will summarize the (a) development and use of self-management skills and behaviors across the life span, (b) factors related to self-management behaviors, (c) development of generic or condition-specific measures of self-management used with a spina bifida population, and (d) development and/or outcomes of interventions to improve self-management in SB. Methods The search strategy was limited to primary research articles published between 2003 and 2019 and followed PRISMA guidelines. The databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. Studies that addressed self-management concepts in individuals throughout the life span and published in English were included. Results The search yielded 108 citations and 56 articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria. A systematic narrative synthesis was reported. The level of evidence identified was primarily Level III articles of good quality. Multiple demographic, environmental, condition and process factors were related to self-management behaviors.

Main Outcome Measures Environmental barriers and supports to participation. Results We developed a conceptual framework to describe how environmental factors influence the participation of people with disabilities, highlighting 8 domains of environmental facilitators and barriers (built, natural, assistive technology, transportation, information and technology access, social support and attitudes, systems and policies, economics) and a transactional model showing the influence of environmental factors on participation at the micro (individual), mesa (community), and macro (societal) levels. Focus group data validated some International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health environmental categories while also bringing unique factors (eg, information and technology access, economic quality of life) to the fore. Data were used to construct items to enable people with disabilities to assess the impact of environmental factors on everyday participation from their firsthand experience. Conclusions Participants with disabilities voiced the need to evaluate the impact of the environment on their participation at the immediate, community, and societal levels. The results have implications for assessing environmental facilitators and barriers to participation within rehabilitation and community settings, evaluating outcomes of environmental interventions, and effecting system and policy changes to target environmental barriers that may result in societal participation disparities versus opportunities.",

		"abstract": "This paper provides a conceptual framework for evaluating research into the transition of handicapped youth from high school to post-high school experiences. It notes that much of the transition research is quasi-experimental and that researchers have typically failed to address issues pertaining to threats to validity, which are pervasive. The paper reviews common research designs and provides examples from the transition literature for each design discussed. It discusses the need for a broader and more sophisticated treatment of scientific evidence in the consideration of causal influences. Finally, it argues that the role of human judgment in evaluating research results should be enhanced.",

Objective For persons with disability and researchers to develop collaboratively a survey that addresses critical quality questions about a new Massachusetts health care program for persons with disability dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Methods Persons with significant physical disability or serious mental health diagnoses participated fully in all research activities, including co-directing the study, co-moderating focus groups, performing qualitative analyses, specifying survey topics, cognitive interviewing, and refining survey language. Several sources informed survey development, including key informant interviews, focus groups, and cognitive testing. Results We interviewed 18 key informants from key stakeholder groups, including disability advocates, health care providers, and governmental agencies. We conducted 12 total English- and Spanish-language focus groups involving 87 participants (38 with physical disability, 49 with mental health diagnoses). Although some details differed, focus group findings were similar across the two disability groups. Analyses by collaborators with disability identified 29 questions for persons with physical disability and 38 for persons with mental health diagnoses. After cognitive testing, the final survey includes questions on topics ranging from independent living principles to health care delivery system concerns. Conclusions The Persons with Disabilities Quality Survey (PDQ-S) captures specific quality concerns of Massachusetts residents with physical or mental health disability about an integrated health plan. PDQ-S requires further testing elsewhere to determine its value for quality assessment more generally and to other populations with disability.",

Methods: This study evaluated the medical record documentation by nurses as an important database (N = 380 patients). The predicted patient outcome instrument developed by the authors was used to collect the data related to patient demographics, acuity, nursing diagnosis, short-and long-term goals, and nursing interventions. The Johnson Behavioral System Model was the nursing conceptual framework used. Findings: Overall, 80% of the predicted patient outcomes were achieved by the time of discharge, with increased length of stay being a factor in increasing the likelihood of achievement of goals. A positive link was found between achievement of outcomes at time of discharge and nursing interventions. A nursing theoretical framework made it possible to prescribe nursing care as a distinction from medical care. Conclusion: This study showed the importance of the nursing database in the medical records and the effectiveness of nursing interventions on predicted patient outcomes achieved by the time of discharge.",

At present, definitions of therapeutic outcome include both maintained symptomatic remission and appropriate functioning in a conceptual framework that targets patients recovery as the ultimate goal. We aimed to know the prevalence and clinical features of patients with schizophrenia achieving these outcomes. Methods A multi-centre, cross-sectional study was performed in more than 100 mental health facilities within Spain. Recently published consensus-based operational criteria for symptomatic remission and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale were used to evaluate outcomes. Other clinical aspects like depressive symptoms, social cognition, premorbid adjustment and patients attitudes to medication were also evaluated. Results Data from 1010 patients were analysed. Of these, 452 (44.8%) were at clinical remission, but only 103 (10.2%) showed an adequate social and/or vocational functioning. Factors predicting both outcomes were better pre-morbid adjustment (odds ratio, OR=1.56) and better social cognitive function (OR=1.14). Other factors, like treatment adherence, current or past psychotherapy and patients age were not associated to functionality but only to clinical remission. Current substance use and previous rehabilitation were associated to a lower likelihood of symptomatic remission. Conclusion Although symptomatic remission in patients with schizophrenia is a realistic and reachable goal, future efforts should be directed to a sustained appropriate functioning in these patients.",

In spite of its magnitude, its prevalence cannot be quantified and its diagnosis has not yet been defined. Objectives To elaborate a conceptual framework and to establish consensus guidelines. Method A mixed qualitative methodology, including frame analysis and nominal groups techniques, was used. The literature was extensively reviewed in evidence based medical databases, scientific publications, and the grey literature. This information was studied and a framing document was prepared. Results Scientific publications covering BIF are scarce. The term that yields a bigger number of results is “Borderline Intelligence”. The Working Group detected a number of areas in which consensus was needed and wrote a consensus document covering the conclusions of the experts and the framing document. Conclusions It is a priority to reach an international consensus about the BIF construct and its operative criteria, as well as to develop specific tools for screening and diagnosis. It is also necessary to define criteria that enable its incidence and prevalence. To know what interventions are the most efficient, and what are the needs of this population, is vital to implement an integral model of care centred on the individual. Resumen Introducción El funcionamiento intelectual límite (FIL) se conceptualiza actualmente como la barrera que separa el funcionamiento intelectual «normal» de la discapacidad intelectual (CI 71-85). A pesar de su magnitud, su prevalencia no puede ser cuantificada y no se ha operativizado su diagnóstico. Objetivos Elaborar un marco conceptual para el FIL y establecer directrices de consenso que permitan la aplicación de una atención integral centrada en la persona. Metodología Se utilizó una metodología mixta cualitativa que combinaba un análisis del marco conceptual con el desarrollo de grupos nominales. Se realizó una revisión bibliográfica extensiva en bases de datos de evidencia médica, publicaciones científicas y literatura gris. Se estudió la información encontrada y se redactó un documento de marco conceptual sobre el FIL. Resultados Las publicaciones centradas en el colectivo de personas con FIL son escasas. El término que mayor número de publicaciones arrojó fue «Borderline Intelligence». Se detectaron una serie de temas sobre los que era necesario alcanzar un consenso y se redactó un documento con las conclusiones del grupo de trabajo. Conclusiones Es necesario establecer un consenso a nivel internacional sobre el constructo del FIL y sus criterios operativos, y desarrollar instrumentos específicos de detección y diagnóstico. También es necesario elaborar criterios que permitan calcular su incidencia y prevalencia. Saber qué intervenciones son las más adecuadas y cuáles son las necesidades de atención que presenta este colectivo es de vital importancia para implementar un modelo de atención integral centrado en la persona.",

		"abstract": "Background To meet the growing need for relationship-centered nursing practice and for nursing school accreditation in Taiwan, nursing school curricula must include training in care for elderly populations in institutional settings. However, educators lack tools for evaluating student performance in such settings. The few tools currently available for measuring the caring in nurses perceived by elderly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are either inappropriate for education purposes or are culturally inappropriate for elderly populations in Taiwan. Objectives To develop a scale for measuring the caring behaviors of caregivers or student volunteers as perceived by a Taiwanese population of elderly residents of LTCFs and to establish the psychometric characteristics of the scale. Methods This study was conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, the researchers comprehensively reviewed the literature on caring. Based on the review, an Elderly Resident-Perceived Caring Scale (EPCS) was developed to measure the caring behaviors perceived by LTCF residents. To establish content and face validity, the items on the scale were reviewed by six experts in two rounds of Delphi study and by four elderly laypersons. In Phase 2, a convenience sample of 297 elderly residents from 18 representative elderly care facilities (i.e., skilled nursing facilities, independent living facilities, and assisted living facilities) in Taiwan were recruited to test the construct validity and reliability of the EPCS. Results The 14-item, 2-dimension questionnaire developed in this study explained 64.33% of the variance in caring perceived by the residents. Factor I, Comforting, included 11 items. Factor II, Encouraging, included 3 items. Cronbachs α values were .924 for the total scale and .930 and .844 for the Comforting and Encouraging, respectively. Conclusion The psychometric qualities of the EPCS were supported. However, further testing of the scale is needed to confirm its psychometric properties in a larger sample.",

		"abstract": "The cost of health care and welfare for the elderly continues to increase as the numberof elderly persons is increasing and they live longer. To help the elderly assess the right type and amount of resources needed, the self-care capabilities of the elderly should be assessed. Lorensens Self-care Capability Scale (LSCS), developed in Denmark in 1986, was designed to assess the capabilities for self-care in the elderly throughout their remaining lifespan on an ongoing basis either at home or in institutions. The purpose of this study was to further test the validity and reliability of the LSCS. The scale (56 items rated on a 4 point rating scale (4 3 2 1) within 13 dimensions of self-care with scores ranging from 56 to 224) was tested on a convenient group of elderly adults, who were living in a retirement community that included both independent and assisted living. Various statistical methods were used. Test-retest reliability completed with 40 subjects 2 weeks apart was r=0.97. Inter-observer reliability was r=0.95. The factor analysis identified the three types of enabling conditions. In conclusion, LSCS was stable when used across two different observation time points and had good interobserver agreement. When used on two different populations of older adults, scores varied for independent living and assisted living. The sample, however, was small and there is a need for future testing with larger samples. This instrument provides a means for nurses to accurately and reliably assess self-care capabilities of older adults to help them decide the level of health and welfare resources needed.",

This paper presents an ontology based exchange mechanism that enables unification and interconnection of life-cycle data spaces to support decision making in highway asset management. The mechanism consists of the following key components: (1) domain and merged ontologies, (2) data wrappers and (3) a data query and reasoning system.

The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health brought the concepts of functionality and disability into a comprehensive whole of multiple dimensions of human functioning, such as biological, psychological, social and environmental. In order to contribute to a greater overall functionality of the individual, the use of software and complex systems can be decisive to assist the people with special needs in all areas of life. The paradigm introduced with ICF is inclusive and universal, so it favors not only the old people, but all others, whether they have a limitation or not. The characteristics of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are appropriate to fulfill elderly needs. However, the current state of development is still mostly oriented to a technological perspective, where the individuals functionality has not been fully addressed. Under the Living Usability Lab project we have defined a methodology and created some evaluation tools for assessment of AAL services according to a Living Lab perspective, based on the ICF. In this paper we intend to describe the base fundamentals of this proposal, as well as present some results concerning a practical implementation of this methodology.",

This investigation used a constructivist approach and qualitative methods to elicit the factors important to the food choices of individuals aged 65 years and older who lived independently. Using a multiple-perspective model of the food choice process as a conceptual framework, two semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with each of 16 individuals to learn about how they chose foods. Interview transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Life course events and experiences were very important factors affecting food choices. Participants’ food choices and preferences were strongly influenced by beliefs related to appropriate food behavior and expected characteristics of foods and meals, many of which had been formed during childhood. Social structure played an important role in the participants’ food choices, and much of this structure was built around food. The values most often negotiated when making food choices were social context, sensory perceptions, monetary considerations, convenience, and physical well-being. Participants managed frequently encountered food choice situations with strategies and repertoires that included routinization, substitution, limitation, and elimination/avoidance. Based on the data, a multiple-perspective model of the food choice process pertaining to the food choices of older adults is proposed.",

		"abstract": "The nephrology community has begun to recognize the importance of physical functioning in the overall treatment of their patients. Physical functioning is highly associated with such outcomes as hospitalization, nursing home admission, falling, level of dependency, and death in older individuals. Because there are many terms used to refer to physical functioning, this report classifies physical functioning into basic actions and complex activities; activities considered essential for maintaining independence, and those considered discretionary that are not required for independent living, but may have an impact on quality of life. We also present a model of the determinants of physical functioning, which goes beyond the presence or absence of disease and considers physical, sensory, environmental, and behavioral factors. Measurement of physical functioning can be complicated and ranges from self-report questionnaires to performance measures of specific tasks to vigorous laboratory measures. There are limitations to each of the measurement methods; however, some level of assessment provides information about the patient that is not otherwise available. Valid and reliable tests of physical performance are available that are easily administered and provide valuable information about the patient. Just as the patients nutrition, medications, and adequacy of dialysis are monitored, baseline and subsequent physical functioning assessments allow us to monitor the patients clinical course as it relates to their physical ability. Such measurement also allows for the identification of patients with lower functioning who would benefit from physical therapy or other exercise intervention.",

The minority-group conceptual framework guided analysis of assistive technology as a symbol of disability. Variations in device use within public and private settings and differences in attitudes according to demographic and disability characteristics also are described. Findings show general user satisfaction with devices. Utilization varies among social settings and also varies by disability type, especially between persons with sensory impairment and those with nonsensory impairment. Public responses were not perceived to be problematic, although users do indicate that the actual application of devices may be unsatisfactory. Users suggestions for further research chiefly propose examination of the systems that develop and distribute assistive devices. results encourage examination of socioeconomic arrangements that reinforce the minority position of people with disabilities by restricting access to aids perceived as beneficial to social roles.",

This framework informs longitudinal analysis of movements into and out of fuel poverty among households in deprived communities in Glasgow. Household surveys across ten years yielded a longitudinal sample of 3297 cases where initial and subsequent fuel poverty status was recorded using an experiential measure. A third of households changed their fuel poverty status over time: 18% moving out of fuel poverty and 16% moving in. Factors strongly associated with movements into fuel poverty included: being a single parent (OR 2.27); experiencing a mental health problem (OR 2.74); and remaining out of work (OR 1.89). Movement out of fuel poverty was less likely among those with infrequent family contact (OR 0.55) and who moved home (OR 0.66); home improvements had no effect upon the experience of fuel poverty. It is argued that the policy problem should be considered one of ‘warmth and energy deprivation’, accompanied by a broader interpretation of vulnerability to as well as from fuel poverty.",

		"abstract": "This paper explores the tensions in ICT-driven personal health systems innovation and the impact of these tensions on valuing health innovation for older people. We regard personal health systems (PHS) as configurational technologies and information infrastructures that need to strike a balance between offering standardized health and care packages on the one hand, and providing options for localization and personalization on the other. We use insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS) to conceptualize the configurational dynamics of PHS innovation and emphasize ‘generification work’ as an important arena for the development, assessment and adoption of personal health innovations. We explore two research and development projects of PHS service-robot platforms and build on Callons concepts of ‘prosthesis’ and ‘habilitation’ to identify two ideal-typical generification strategies in the projects. A prosthetic generification strategy positions the robot as part of a socio-technical agencement that configures older persons into disciplined agency, while a habilitating strategy speaks to them as active actors in the innovation process. We demonstrate how the designers in both projects were often unconsciously led into a prosthetic strategy despite initial intentions to the contrary. We explain this by mechanisms of personalization, needs capturing and othering. However, elements of habilitating strategies were also present, although in a less articulated form. We identify these elements and argue that in aging societies, health innovations need to pursue prosthesis and habilitation simultaneously. We conclude our paper with implications for innovation policy and health technology assessment.",

		"abstract": "Many transformations in how mental health care is delivered have required the development of new ways of providing care, treatment and support to mental health consumers. In the recent past, to support consumers and their carers adequately and appropriately, there has been emphasis on case management and care coordination. There is a need to consider whether over-emphasis on case management should be limited to the minority of mental health consumers who are unable to make competent decisions, whereas majority of consumers should take complete charge of their own treatment. PRISM (Promoting Resilience, Independence and Self Management) is a conceptual framework that potentially offers an opportunity to empower consumers to take charge of their own treatment by using specific tools, including a PRISM Pack, Take Charge Sheet, Protocol for Appropriate Care and use of methods that ensure that the mental health consumer does become a key decision maker with regard to their own care and treatment.",

		"abstract": "This paper measures the cyclicality of an important input into elderly health: informal care. Using independent survey measures of informal caregiving and care receipt over the past two decades, we find that informal care from adult children to their elderly parents is countercyclical. By contrast, informal care from spouses is procyclical among individuals in their sixties. We find little corresponding change in the use of formal care, highlighting the potential for unmet care needs across the business cycle. These findings suggest that informal health inputs may play an important role in the interpretation of the cyclicality of elderly mortality.",

The aim of this work is to design and build methodologically, throughout ontological engineering, the ON-SMMILE model to be used as support of future works closely linked to supervision of students learning as competence-based recommender system. For this purpose, our model is designed as a set of ontological resources that have been extended, standardized, interrelated and adapted to be used in multiple learning environments. In this paper, we also analyze the available approaches based on instructional design which can be added to ontology network to build the proposed model. As a case study, a chemical experiment in a virtual environment and its instantiation are described in terms of ON-SMMILE.",

This includes cross national exchange of research, policy and practise, regional advocacy networking and global policy development. Furthering this emerging international child welfare perspective requires extending it to countries in the developing world and building conceptual frameworks which encompass a social ecology of care leaving, including its global dimension, the latter needs to address not only the needs, expectations and rights of care leavers but also the theories of change underpinning service design and delivery. Such a model is presented combining resilience and social capital as personal assets situated within a social ecology of support. To illustrate how this provides a means to help engage with the experience of countries where there appears to be very little information available on care leaving, a small scale South African initiative is considered. SA-YES is a youth mentoring project for young people leaving a variety of out of home placements. Planned as a three-year pilot, initial results are encouraging but require more rigorous evaluation focusing on program process and outcomes, quality of interpersonal relationships and synchronisation with cultural expectations and policy environment.",

Objectives: To describe instruments that have been developed to quantify (aspects of) social outcomes in research on persons with a disability, and to evaluate the clinimetric characteristics of some of the more prominent and promising measures. Data Sources: Literature in social health, social psychiatry, developmental disabilities, independent living, gerontology, medical rehabilitation, and quality of life studies. Study Selection: Social outcomes are defined as those changes or differences in the social functioning (broadly defined) of persons with disabilities that result directly or indirectly from impairments and functional limitations. Excluded were measures that focus on purely physical or psychologic aspects of functioning, apply to children only, or quantify 1 social domain only. Data Extraction: For 16 instruments the distribution of items across the participation domains of the International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation is presented, as well as a distribution of items by metrics used. For 5, clinimetric information from published studies were reviewed and summarized in letter grades. Data Synthesis: Several instruments have broad coverage, acceptable respondent burden, and moderate to good reliability, validity, and sensitivity. Conclusions: Social outcomes should be more routinely included in disability and rehabilitation research.

To the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of grasping what research has been conducted on smart aging. Thus, there is no discussion of major issues and future directions of smart aging. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart aging in three ways: 1) to synthesize the components of smart aging based on the comprehensive literature review, 2) to examine the range of topics extracted from 3760 web pages and 3) to analyze the research activities on smart aging by conducting a content analysis of 4500 web pages of the NIH funded organizations websites related to smart aging. The results of the comprehensive literature review indicate that the discussions on smart aging in the scientific publications are by and large classified into the following three directions: Technologies, Aging Medical Care, and Behavior and Social. In addition, the major topics from search engine datasets, which echoes more general discussions from various different parties, are related to entertainment program and social media, along with medical science and innovation technologies, whereas the research activities of NIH funded organizations focused on cross-disciplinary research in Behavioral and Social science, and Medical Care.",

Mental health is measured by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES) and physical health by the Activities of Daily Living (ADL). We find significant direct and indirect effects for both forms of health, with indirect effects explaining 10% of the effect of past mental health on physical health and 8% of the effect of past physical health on mental health. Physical activity is the largest contributor to the indirect effects. There are stronger indirect effects for males in mental health (9.9%) and for older age groups in mental health (13.6%) and in physical health (12.6%).

		"abstract": "Objective To develop a scale for measuring factors that facilitate participation of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in travel-related activities: Removing Travel Restrictions Influencing Participation (ReTRIP). Design A mixed-method approach where in the qualitative phase, items were developed and written based on results of interviewers with different stakeholder groups and in the quantitative phase, survey data were collected to examine the psychometric properties of the scale. Setting Home, work, and community settings. Participants People living with SCI, caregivers or family members, therapists, travel professionals (N=333). Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures An 11-item ReTRIP scale that measures the facilitators that enhance the travel participation of people with SCI. Results In the qualitative phase of the study, 5 categories of travel facilitators were identified based on semistructured in-depth interviews with 83 respondents from 4 stakeholder groups. Initial items of the ReTRIP scale were written based on the travel facilitators identified. Items in the scale were then revised based on results of cognitive interviews and an expert panel review. In the quantitative phase, a total of 250 patients enrolled in a Spinal Cord Injury Model System were systematically selected to report their experience with each travel facilitator. Item-response theory–based Rasch analysis revealed that the 11-item ReTRIP has acceptable psychometric properties, containing 2 main dimensions: industry-oriented facilitators (6 items) and self-oriented facilitators (5 items). Conclusions The 11-item ReTRIP scale demonstrates promising psychometric properties, allowing researchers and clinicians to potentially use self-reported environmental factors that are beneficial for people’s participation in travel after SCI to properly design client-centered interventions. Future studies using a larger sample are needed to validate the scale.",

		"abstract": "Aging populations in developing countries have spurred the introduction of public pension programs to preserve the standard of living for the elderly. The often-overlooked mechanism of intergenerational transfers, however, can dampen these intended policy effects, as adult children who make income contributions to their parents could adjust their behavior in response to changes in their parents’ income. Exploiting a unique policy intervention in China, we examine using a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) approach how a new pension program impacts inter vivos transfers. We show that pension benefits lower the propensity of adult children to transfer income to elderly parents in the context of a large middle-income country, and we also estimate a small crowd-out effect. Taken together, these estimates fit the pattern of previous research in high-income countries, although our estimates of the crowd-out effect are significantly smaller than previous studies in both middle- and high-income countries.

Aims The objective of this scoping review is to investigate the degree to which the ICF and ICF-CY have been used in transition research and practice since its initial publication. Methods Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage methodological framework guided the scoping review using the following databases: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Keywords included: ‘ICF’, ‘ICF-CY’, and ‘transition’, which were adapted to each database. Results 25 articles met final inclusion. Two key themes emerged regarding use of the ICF: 1) the ICF enhances transdisciplinary processes to inform transition planning and interventions; and 2) the ICF facilitates comprehensive and developmentally appropriate transition services over a youth’s lifecourse. The strengths and limitations of the ICF in guiding the planning and delivery of transition services are discussed. Some limitations include the large number of items inherent within the ICF and a lack of clarity between the components of activity and participation. Conclusion Key recommendations include: i) further explanation and development of items for quality of life and well-being, personal factors, and psychological issues; and ii) additional research to advance knowledge towards developing empirically- based evidence for the application of the ICF in clinical practice to facilitate transition.",

The purpose of this article is to present some of the critical factors in the organization and delivery of services and programs for students-in-transition with severe to profound mental retardation. First, the extent of need for transition services and programs is briefly reviewed. Second, a framework for transition case management in Philadelphia is described. And last, three interrelated factors — communications, capability, and disposition — contributing to successful planned intervention are examined in relation to Philadelphias initiative in establishing a service delivery system for students-in-transition with severe to profound mental retardation.",

This research investigated the inter-relationships between neighbourhood built environment, physical activity and three physical health outcomes among older adults in Singapore. Methods Drawing on 2018 data from 810 community-dwelling older adults in Singapore, a simultaneous equation approach was utilised to disentangle the complex interactions among built environment (both objective and self-reported measurements), physical activity and physical health (i.e., body mass index, functional capability and presence or absence of ‘three high’ chronic diseases) while controlling for other confounding factors, including socio-demographics and health behaviour. Results The accessibility to destinations (e.g., parks, open spaces, playgrounds) and other walkability features (e.g., neighbourhood safety, covered footpath) could promote transportation or recreational outdoor physical activity and therefore, health among older residents in Singapore. Interestingly, built environment characteristics related differently to physical activity undertaken for transportation and recreational purposes. There was a bi-directional relationship between an older adults functional status and transport-related physical activity. There was also evidence that the connection between number of chronic diseases and recreational physical activity was reciprocal. Conclusion Insights into the built environment-physical activity-physical health relationships highlight the importance of supportive built environment in the process of health enhancement for older people.",

Methods Unsigned, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to adults aged 65 or older, family caregivers, and home-care/health and social care professionals. A total of 1,004 responses were collected. Results In Japan, many people were already familiar with robots in their daily lives. The most notable finding about their perspectives on home-care robots was related to safety. Moreover, 93.7% of the Japanese respondents said, “If the user cannot decide whether to use a home-care robot, family members who know the user well should decide,” followed by 76.4% in Ireland and 83.1% in Finland (p < .001). In Ireland, 81.8% of the respondents said, “I want to help other people and society by participating in the research and development of home-care robots” (Japan: 69.9%; Finland: 67.5%) (p = .006). In Finland, many people had a negative impression of robots compared to the other two countries. Finland had the highest percentage (75.4%) of respondents who said, “Health care professionals should be allowed to use secondary information collected by a home-care robot” (Japan and Ireland: 64%) (p = .024). Moreover, Ireland and Finland emphasized the need to guarantee the entitlement to receive human care. Conclusions Devising optimal strategies for the development and social implementation of home-care robots by incorporating various perspectives while valuing human dignity will require examination of each country’s characteristics with respect to history, culture, policies, and values related to robots.",

		"abstract": "Estimating costs in child welfare services is critical as new service models are incorporated into routine practice. This paper describes a unit costing estimation system developed in England (cost calculator) together with a pilot test of its utility in the United States where unit costs are routinely available for health services but not for child welfare services. The cost calculator approach uses a unified conceptual model that focuses on eight core child welfare processes. Comparison of these core processes in England and in four counties in the United States suggests that the underlying child welfare processes generated from England were perceived as very similar by child welfare staff in California county systems with some exceptions in the review and legal processes. Overall, the adaptation of the cost calculator for use in the United States child welfare systems appears promising. The paper also compares the cost calculator approach to the workload approach widely used in the United States and concludes that there are distinct differences between the two approaches with some possible advantages to the use of the cost calculator approach, especially in the use of this method for estimating child welfare costs in relation to the incorporation of evidence-based interventions into routine practice.",

		"abstract": "Living independently in the community is a primary goal for older adults, particularly for the estimated 10% to 20% of long-stay nursing home residents who have low care requirements. According to the model of person-environment fit, individuals with high levels of everyday competence have the ability to solve problems associated with everyday life. Nursing home residents with high levels of everyday competence and low care needs have poor person-environment fit, placing them at risk for declines in function, maladaptive behavior, and affective disorders. The goal of this article is to present a framework for the integration of everyday competence with standardized goal-setting and care-planning processes to enable the transition of appropriate nursing home residents back to the community. Barriers to community transitions exist across several Key Domains: rehabilitation, personal assistance and services, caregiver support, finances, housing, and transportation. We propose a research agenda to develop and implement a toolkit based on this framework that nursing home staff can use to overcome barriers to transition by (1) assessing residents everyday competence, (2) developing personally meaningful goals that facilitate transition, and (3) conducting structured care planning to support resident goals around returning to the community. If successful, this toolkit has the potential to reduce costs associated with nursing home care and to improve functional health, psychological well-being, and quality of life for older adults. The proposed framework and toolkit complement national efforts focused on transitioning nursing home residents back into the community.",

		"abstract": "People who have experienced psychosis describe functional and personal recovery as a key goal of treatment. To date, the early, pervasive and influential role of cognitive impairments in functional recovery in psychosis has been predominantly addressed using approaches aiming to remediate clinically-defined cognitive deficits. Despite acceptance of the recovery and strengths-based model of care for first-episode psychosis (FEP), there has been minimal attention paid to the potential for strengths-based approaches to be extended to cognitive function. The purpose of this review is to present the case for supplementary strengths-based approaches to addressing cognition and functioning in FEP. In this review we appraise current approaches to addressing cognition in FEP that have primarily focused on remediating cognitive impairment, showing evidence for inconsistent engagement and generally small treatment effects. We describe the important role of psychological factors such as motivation and self-efficacy in mediating the relationship between cognitive performance and functional outcome, and draw on positive psychology and self-determination theory as models for potential application in relation to a cognitive-strengths paradigm. Our review supports the argument for complementing approaches for remediating cognitive deficits by applying strengths-based or positive psychology approaches to the domain of cognition as a promising avenue for further enhancing personal and functional recovery from FEP.",

		"abstract": "Introduction Supported housing−which offers permanent, community-based housing and supportive services−effectively addresses homelessness. Yet, many persons with serious mental illness (SMI) struggle to retain housing in these programs. Social skills−which facilitate social interactions and instrumental tasks−predict premature exits from supported housing. Though social skills training effectively improves social skills and functioning for persons with SMI, this intervention is essentially absent from supported housing initiatives. Methods This study will use literature review, key informant interviews and an expert panel to adapt social skills training for supported housing, aiming to improve housing retention among SMI persons in these programs. In the Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supported Housing program (HUD-VASH) at VA Greater Los Angeles, we will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial of the adapted intervention. Baseline and 6-month assessments (measuring social skills, mental health status, healthcare utilization, social networks, money management, and housing outcomes) will be conducted with intervention participants (n = 30) and a usual care control group (n = 20). We will use the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to compare change over 6 months between groups, capturing the interventions effectiveness on factors strongly associated with housing retention. Qualitative data and surveys with staff, leadership, and participants will gather data on factors relevant to the interventions future implementation in routine care. Discussion Few effective psychosocial interventions for persons with SMI have been adapted or studied in supported housing initiatives. To our knowledge, this is the first study to adapt and study the effectiveness and implementation of social skills training in supported housing programs.",

Since its launch in 2009, more than 400 million Chinese have enrolled in the NRPS. We first describe plausible pathways through which pension may affect mental health. We then use the national sample of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to examine the effect of pension enrollment on mental health, as measured by CES-D and self-reported depressive symptoms. To overcome the endogeneity of pension enrollment or of income change on mental health, we exploit geographic variation in pension program implementation. Results indicate modest to large reductions in depressive symptoms due to pension enrollment; this effect is more pronounced among individuals eligible to claim pension income, among populations with more financial constraints, and among those with worse baseline mental health. Our findings hold for a rich set of robustness checks and falsification tests.",

Using panel data derived from credit reports, we begin by documenting an association between debt characteristics – including credit risk, delinquency and loan balances on student loans, auto loans and credit cards – and subsequent entry into, and durations in parental co-residence. We find relationships consistent with parental co-residence as a smoothing mechanism for young adults facing borrowing constraints. We then formally test the hypothesis that credit accessibility affects co-residence choice by analyzing plausibly exogenous reductions in credit card limits initiated by banks during the Great Recession. We find that young adults who experienced limit reductions were 5% more likely to enter co-residence, and stayed 4% longer in co-residence. The effects of credit limit reductions were larger for young adult borrowers who were closer to their credit limit before the reduction.",

This review did not reveal the existence of any single comprehensive outcome measurement instrument that could be used for the homeless system of care. System-level outcomes include cost savings, reduction of access barriers, and organizational linkages.

		"abstract": "Objective: Three a priori hypotheses were tested: (1) There are significant differences in sociosexual behaviors of women with physical disabilities compared with women without disabilities; (2) the sexual functioning of women with disabilities is significantly related to age at onset of disability; (3) psycho logical factors explain more of the variance in the sexual functioning of women with physical disabilities than do disability, social, or environmental factors. Design: Case-comparison study using written survey. Setting: General community. Participants: The questionnaire was mailed to 1,150 women with physical disabilities who were recruited as volunteers or through independent living centers. Each woman gave a second copy of the questionnaire to an able-bodied female friend, which comprised the comparison group. The response rate was 45%, with 475 caused and 425 comparisons eligible to participate. The most common disability type was spinal cord injury (24%), followed by polio (18%), muscular dystrophy (11%), cerebral palsy (11%), multiple sclerosis (10%), joint disorders (7%), and skeletal abnormalities (5%). Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Sexual functioning, consisting of four factors: (1) sexual desire, (2) sexual activity, (3) sexual response, and (4) sexual satisfaction. Results: Highly significant differences were found in level of sexuala ctivity (p = .000001), response (p = .000009), and satisfaction (p = .000001) between women with and without disabilities. No significant differences were found between groups on sexual desire. Severity of disability was not significantly related to level of sexual activity. Conclusion: Psychological and social factors exert a strong impact on the sexual functioning of women with physical disabilities. Further investigation is needed of the effect of social environment on development of self-esteem and sexual self-image, and how these influences affect levels of sexual functioning in women with physical disabilities.",

Setting Home, work, and community settings. Participants People living with SCI, caregivers/family members, therapists, and travel professionals (N=333). Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures A 19-item TRIP scale that measures the travel barriers encountered by people with SCI.

Seven cognitive interviews and an expert panel conducted reviews for content validity of the scale, and 19 items were included in the quantitative assessment of the scale. A total of 250 patients enrolled in the Rocky Mountain Regional Spinal Injury System was systematically selected to report their experience with each travel barrier. Item-response theory–based Rasch analysis revealed that TRIP has acceptable psychometric properties. Conclusions The 19-item TRIP scale demonstrates promising psychometric properties for the scale to be used in clinical settings to quickly identify environmental barriers individuals with SCI encounter when traveling. It has the potential to assist with developing interventions that will improve the travel experience of individuals with SCI or to assist with strategies to overcome travel barriers.",

We also report the psychometric properties of this assessment. One hundred and four persons with dementia took part in ten different group activities, with each activity conducted twice at random order so that 20 activities were observed for each group of participants. Following each group activity, research and therapeutic recreation staff members used the GOME assessment to independently rate participants on individual-level measures of attendance duration and engagement, and group level measures (e.g., positive and negative interactions among group members). Reliability and validity analyses comparing observer ratings for each group activity on the individual-level measures of attendance and engagement showed good psychometric properties. Different measures collected on a group level differed with respect to their psychometric quality.

In order to retrieve reliable estimates, I exploit the fact that medical guidelines cause a discontinuity in the probability that General Practitioners (GP) diagnose their patients with T2D as a function of exact blood test cut-off in a regression discontinuity design (RDD) approach. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), I find compelling evidence that health information, in the form of T2D diagnosis, influences the protection of health into old age. Specifically, after receiving T2D diagnosis, over time, individuals reported a 2.1 lower body mass index (BMI) as well as 5.5 cm lower waist circumference, relative to their counterparts. With respect to self-reported physical health, the results imply that those diagnosed with T2D reported a 0.19 and 0.70 higher score in increased activities of daily living (ADL) and body mobility indexes, respectively. Finally, while I find evidence that T2D-diagnosed patients reported a significant, 0.5 higher, score in the word listening test, I find no evidence that T2D diagnosis impacted self-reported depression levels. I provide a wide variety of evidence on the validity of the results.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of the study was to examine dyadic factors of home modification in frail older adults and their informal caregivers for improving health care at home in the United States. A secondary data analysis used the National Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons caregiver survey dataset. Among randomly selected samples from 7 states in the U.S., 737dyads of informal caregivers and frail older adults were selected based on age and medical conditions. Descriptive analyses and a hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis were performed. The study findings showed that the prevalence of home modification in the survey population was 42.20% in the United States. The home modifying group was likely to live together in a rural area, to consist of older care-recipients and younger caregivers, and to be Caucasian (p<.05). Physically functional impairments were the strongest factors of home modification (p<.01), while older adults living with heart disease were more likely to modify their homes (p=.03). In conclusion, older adults’ and their caregivers’ factors clearly affect home modification for health care at home. Our findings revealed that home modification represents an important contribution to multidisciplinary care and is based on comprehensive assessments, multidisciplinary decision-making processes, and careful planning of individualized interventions. Relevant policy suggestions may enhance the effectiveness of home modification to support aging in place in the United States.",

		"abstract": "Young adults often face barriers in finding affordable housing due to their economic constraints and the fact that they are experiencing a distinct phase of the family life cycle. In response to this situation, there is a growing interest in shared housing as one of the solutions for housing difficulties of young single households in Korea. In spite of numerous studies highlighting the characteristics and benefits of shared housing, we still have a limited understanding regarding which young single households have particular interests in shared housing. This study fills this gap by examining various determinants of preference for shared housing among young single households in Seoul, South Korea. Based on a household drop-off survey of 1000 respondents, this study utilized a binary logistic regression model to identify various determinants—socio-demographic, personal, dwelling, and locational characteristics of young singles—that may affect the preference for shared housing. Furthermore, our analyses accounted for rental housing submarkets to specify how these determinants of preference for shared housing vary across a city as well as neighborhoods stratified by housing rent. Our findings may help planning practitioners and policymakers to provide better shared housing options across neighborhoods and develop housing policies to encourage young people to choose shared housing arrangements.",

		"abstract": "Children of color are over-represented in the child welfare system. Research suggests that disproportionality is predominately attributable to the resource poor environments in which these children are raised. However, it is important to understand whether the child welfare system is able to diminish these societal level inequities, and consequently disproportionality, by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes of youth exiting state care. Encouragingly, research in this area has found few racial/ethnic differences in the outcomes of former foster youth. However, these studies are regional and have not investigated outcomes for a broad array of racial/ethnic groups. To fill this gap, the present study uses the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) to examine educational attainment, employment, homelessness, and incarceration for white, African-American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native emancipated youth. Results reveal that African-American youth are less likely to be employed and more likely to report incarceration than white youth. However, African-American youth were 36% more likely to enroll in higher education than white youth and there were no significant differences in outcomes between white and Hispanic youth. However, AI/AN youth exhibited no advantages and significant disadvantages relative to youth from other racial/ethnic groups. Results suggest that child welfare services and state supports for youth exiting care can contribute to improved outcomes and racial/ethnic parity. However, additional effort is needed to reduce poor outcomes, particularly for American Indian/Alaska Native youth.",

Objectives This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the TechSAge Minimum Battery as a holistic assessment of health for people aging with disabilities. Methods Survey data of socio-demographic and health characteristics were collected from 176 older adults with long-term vision, hearing, and/or mobility disabilities. A series of descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted to illustrate the heterogeneity of the sample. An in-depth analysis of the subsample with vision difficulty was conducted to highlight the tool’s value in assessing detailed contextual information for a specific disability. Results Prevalence of health conditions (M = 4.1; SD = 2.5), prescription medications (M = 4.1; SD = 3.9), and serious functional difficulties (M = 1.6; SD = 0.85) indicated a fair degree of comorbidity, but with considerable variation in number and type among individuals. Subjective health ratings were high overall, but lower scores were correlated with additional comorbidities (r = −0.31-0.40, p =<.001). Analyses of the subsample with vision difficulty demonstrated heterogeneity in functional capacity, degree of impairment, duration, and use of supportive aids. Conclusions Findings highlighted the heterogeneity among people aging with disability and demonstrated the importance of capturing multi-dimensional factors inclusive of an individual’s capacity, context, and personal factors, which the Minimum Battery provides in an integrated assessment. Potential healthcare applications of the tool are discussed with implications for bridging aging and disability services.",

		"abstract": "Large purpose-built retirement complexes including continuing care options are increasingly popular ways to ‘age in place’ for older people in New Zealand and internationally. Promoted by their corporate owners as a lifestyle choice offering a wealth of activities and social interaction in manicured settings along with security and increasing care on site as needed, these entities offer new ways for wealthier older people to age. Applying an ethnographic approach to a case study residential complex in Auckland, New Zealand, we explore how residents experience inclusion and exclusion, and sense of community within such environments with a diversity of fit and frail residents. Data was collected from interviews, walk-about conversations, social site mapping and a selection of media material to gain an understanding of the social issues important to the residents. The twelve participants, aged between 70 and 87, were all independent residents living in the independent part of the complex, which is situated in a socio-economically wealthy suburb of Auckland. We identified that social connections were often fragile, and existing social group membership was key to shared community experiences and a sense of belonging. Residents who found themselves on the social fringes, particularly as newcomers or through health decline, were at risk of marginalisation, stigma, and social exclusion. Further, we identified how the design and layout, and tensions in the structure of the resident-management relationship potentially hinder inclusiveness and sense of community. These findings shed light on alternative experiences at odds with the commercial and populist framing of these places as age-friendly and inclusive communities promoting active lifestyles.",

		"abstract": "A dramatic global increase in the pervasiveness of chronic illness has coincided with a reduction in the availability of healthcare resources, coupled with increased costs for care, forcing a fundamental reevaluation of care processes. These trends have driven interest in the use of advanced healthcare information systems and telematics applications to improve care availability while reducing overall costs, but such measures require taking an integrated approach to a range of interrelated social, economic, political and cultural impacts and challenges. Telecare technologies allow hospitals to continuously monitor biomedical indicators, while providing patients with online services such as clinical appointment scheduling, medical consulting, remote alerts, etc. Telecare has the potential to transform the healthcare industry by reducing costs, increasing quality, and enhancing patient satisfaction. The development of a real-time monitoring healthcare service model through the integration of information and communications technologies (ICT) has emerged as a research priority. This study explores the design, value creation, development and evaluation of Telecare systems and mobile health applications for autonomous health management to ensure appropriate home-based health monitoring and treatment while improving care performance. A well-defined methodology is needed to develop artifacts due to increasing disease complexity. This study develops an Android-based self-management application based on design science research methodology. The App assists users in collecting and monitoring indicators to prompt appropriate care services. This study uses individual home self-care as the basic Telecare unit to design a service model integrating six kinds of healthcare services. Usability testing is conducted to reflect five constructs: system usefulness, ease of learning, information quality, interface quality, and overall satisfaction. Experimental results support previous research findings regarding the Chronic Care Model and enhance the effectiveness of mobile-based services. Our work provides a useful reference to researchers and practitioners interested in understanding how hospitals can better facilitate more effective mobile-based technology adoption in today’s e-health environment.",

Both language disturbance and functioning can be evaluated with clinician-rated and performance-based measures. We aimed to investigate the concurrent association between clinician-rated and performance-based measures of language disturbance and functioning in FEP. We assessed 108 individuals presenting to an Early Intervention in Psychosis Service in Ireland. Formal thought disorder (FTD) dimensions and bizarre idiosyncratic thinking (BIT) were rated with structured assessment tools. Functioning was evaluated with a performance-based instrument, a clinician-rated measure and indicators of real-world functioning. The disorganisation dimension of FTD was significantly associated with clinician-rated measures of occupational and social functioning (Beta=−0.19, P<0.05 and Beta=−0.31, P<0.01, respectively). BIT was significantly associated with the performance-based measure of functioning (Beta=−0.22, P<0.05). Language disturbance was of less value in predicting real-world measures of functioning. Clinician-rated and performance-based assessments of language disturbance are complementary and each has differential associations with functioning. Communication disorders should be considered as a potential target for intervention in FEP, although further evaluation of the longitudinal relationship between language disturbance and functioning should be undertaken.",

Additional individual-level variables controlled for in the model were age, gender, race/ethnicity, living arrangement, education, the number of chronic conditions and disabilities; as were workshop-level characteristics of class size, language used, workshop leader experience, location urbanity and delivery site type. Results Participants who provided care to family or friends were 28% more likely to complete the workshop compared with those who did not (odds ratio = 1.279, P < 0.05).

We find some suggestive evidence that the effects are due to substitution of home care for nursing home utilization. The magnitude of these estimates suggests that moderate reductions in post-retirement income would significantly alter long-term utilization patterns among elderly individuals.",

		"abstract": "Public rental housing (PRH) exits exert a profound influence on turnover rates, which further impact the public housing principles of fairness and efficiency. However, very few studies have attempted to investigate the tenants barriers to exit PRH units in Chinese studies. In this paper, using data drawn from a randomly sampled survey of tenants in Beijing during the March 2017, we employ structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the factors influencing tenants barriers to exit. We find that housing availability is the most influential factor in determining the tenants barriers to leave PRH, and residential satisfaction is also considered as a motivation against PRH exits. In addition, residential satisfaction transfers the impact of tenants perceptions of housing and neighborhood to exit barriers. Especially, the effects of housing availability on exit barriers are higher in some groups, such as elderly, high income households, large-sized families and respondents with long spell of residence. Any program aimed at getting tenants to leave public housing sector needs to reduce their barriers to access to the private rental market and take into consideration the various characteristics of the tenants.",

Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with representatives from PCWAs in twelve metropolitan counties. Using grounded theory analysis, interview data were thematically coded and organized into a conceptual model depicting the potential effects of volunteer use on agency and child outcomes. Most (n = 9) agencies used volunteers, but only four used volunteers in roles where they had direct contact with youth (e.g., as mentors). Respondents described volunteer programs as promoting outcomes in three major areas: community engagement, agency access to supports and resources, and positive youth development. Moreover, respondents described potential connections among these outcome areas, with community engagement leading to more supports and resources, which in turn, promoted positive youth development.

		"abstract": "This article examines the potential usefulness of the ICF in the treatment of mental disorders. We suggest that there is a poor fit between the nature of mental disorders and the dominant model of health care based on the treatment of acute medical illness. An overemphasis on diagnosis has contributed to a bias toward pharmacotherapy and underuse of psychological treatments for people with mental disorders. Mental disorders are more accurately conceptualized as chronic conditions, in which the persons pattern of functioning rather than diagnosis is most important in determining what services are needed. This is particularly the case for people with serious mental illness, who may have lost the ability to carry out daily tasks, live independently, work, have interpersonal relationships, and engage in leisure pursuits. The ICF is a universal framework for describing the full range of human functioning that is highly consistent with the perspective and treatment approaches of psychiatric rehabilitation. The ICF provides a broad, transdisciplinary framework for treatment planning, defining goals, assessing progress and outcomes, and allocating resources for people with mental disorders. Extended clinical examples are provided to illustrate the potential application of the ICF in this context. Résumé Cet article examine l’utilité potentielle de la CIF pour le traitement des troubles mentaux. Nous suggérons que le modèle de soins dominant fondé sur le traitement de la maladie aiguë est peu adapté à la nature des troubles mentaux. En accordant trop d’importance au diagnostic on a introduit un biais consistant à privilégier la pharmacothérapie au détriment des traitements psychologiques pour les personnes présentant des troubles mentaux. Les troubles mentaux sont plutôt à concevoir comme des états chroniques, pour lesquels le mode de fonctionnement de la personne, plus que le diagnostic, est de première importance pour déterminer le type de services dont elle a besoin. C’est notamment le cas pour des personnes présentant une maladie mentale grave, qui peuvent avoir perdu la capacité de mener des activités quotidiennes, de vivre de façon autonome, de travailler, d’entretenir des relations interpersonnelles et d’avoir des activités de loisir. La CIF est un cadre universel de description du fonctionnement humain, cohérent avec la perspective et les approches thérapeutiques de la réhabilitation psychiatrique. La CIF offre un cadre transdisciplinaire pour la programmation de traitement, la définition d’objectifs, l’évaluation des évolutions et des conséquences, et l’allocation de ressources pour des personnes ayant des troubles mentaux. Des exemples cliniques illustreront l’application possible de la CIF dans ce contexte.",

		"abstract": "Each year, more than 1 million American children and youth experience homelessness (Hammer, Finkelhor, & Sedlak, 2002; Office of Applied Studies, 2004). The transient nature of this population makes it difficult to study, but youth homelessness has been identified with a number of problematic outcomes as well as a pathway to chronic adult homelessness (Baker Collins, 2013; Chamberlain & Johnson, 2011). Yet, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a common intervention for homeless youth—transitional housing. In this paper, we describe the outcomes of homeless youth who participated in a youth-only transitional housing program. We analyze administrative data on 174 youth who entered and exited the Daybreak Transitional Housing program (Daybreak TH) between 2011 and 2014. We find that the majority of Daybreak TH participants were employed at least 20 h a week at program exit. Youth exited Daybreak TH with higher wages on average, while nearly half achieved educational gains from program entry to exit. Youth who resided in Daybreak TH for 12 months or longer were more likely to achieve positive program outcomes than youth who entered and exited the program in fewer than 12 months. Finally, youth who used drugs and alcohol were less likely than their peers to achieve desired program outcomes, as were those who suffered from chronic illnesses or attention deficit, conduct, or disruptive behavior disorders. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and areas for future research.",

		"abstract": "The peer respite model is an emerging model of community mental health support in the United States, yet, it remains understudied and undertheorized in post-asylum geographies and posthuman scholarship on recovery. A focused ethnography sought to address this gap by considering the sensibilities and urgencies that emerged at a peer respite in the U.S. Southwest. More broadly, this paper describes atmospheres of recovery that formed within the space itself, among peer staff who aimed to motivate guests (service users) to acquire social services during their stay and guests who often experienced homelessness. Beyond an anthropocentric, individualized notion of recovery, we describe the spatial arrangements, temporal urgencies, and material scarcities that mediated guests’ experiences of their stay and suggest that the peer respite can be understood as a site of transformation that both enables and limits possibilities for feelings of wellbeing and recovery to arise.",

The purpose of this paper was to empirically assess the interest and potential mechanisms for consumer involvement in HTA by identifying what health consumer organizations consider meaningful involvement, examining current practices internationally and developing a model for involvement based on identified priorities and needs. Canadian health consumer groups representing the largest disease or illness conditions reported a desire for involvement in HTA and provided feedback on mechanisms for facilitating their involvement.",

		"abstract": "Despite effrts to improve the discharge planning process and subsequent outcomes, existing mechanisms fail to accurately identify elders needs for follow-up care. Studies report rehospitalization rates ranging from 12 to 50%. The two aims of this study were to (1) examine the difference in outcomes for elders hospitalized with heart failure and caregivers who participated in a professional-patient partnership model of discharge planning compared to those who received the usual discharge planning and (2) examine differences in costs associated with hospital readmission and use of the emergency room following hospital discharge. A before-and-after nonequivalent control group design was used for this study. Data were collected from the control and the intervention cohorts before discharge and at 2 weeks and 2 months postdischarge. One hundred and fifty-eight patient-caregiver dyads completed both the predischarge and 2-weeks postdischarge interviews; 140 also completed a 2-month follow up. The average age of elders was 73.7 years; the average age of the caregivers was 58.5 years. The findings indicated that elders in the intervention cohort felt more prepared to manage care, reported more continuity of information about care management and services, felt they were in better health, and when readmitted spent fewer days in the hospital than the control cohort. Caregivers in the intervention cohort also reported receiving more information about care management and having a more positive reaction to caregiving 2 weeks postdischarge than the control cohort.",

The data were elicited from a sample of 106 residents of 25 SCAs in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who participated in a longitudinal interview survey. The data analysis involved use of bivariate statistical inferential tests and multiple regression frameworks. The findings disclose that the moves had only a moderate impact on parent–child residential separation and interaction. However, statistically significant predictors of four personal state outcomes (self-rated health, morale, depression, self-esteem) of the moves include variables concerning change in the older parent’s personal resources, everyday travel, and subjective appraisals of service, social, and physical components of the local neighbourhood. The findings have important policy implications in relation to the provision of appropriate behaviour settings for senior housing.",

We then run a Oaxaca-Blinder style decomposition analysis to explain the race gap in household formation over this 13-year period, and conduct several robustness checks. We find strong support for the influence of economic context, with strikingly different results by race. Blacks were most sensitive to rents, which increased more dramatically for black young adults over most of the 2001-2013 period compared with whites rents. The results also suggest that blacks were operating in strongly segmented housing markets throughout this period. In contrast, whites were most sensitive to employment rates, which decreased for white young adults over this period from 75 percent in 2001 to 70 percent in 2013. Despite their unrestricted access to the entire labor market, falling employment proved a significant deterrent to new household formation for white young adults.",

In fact, smart houses are substantially intertwined with integrated ICT technologies which aim to ensure comfortable living environments. Despite the identified challenges, the proliferation of smart houses into urban areas requires an integration of them in the city for creating intelligent environments. As a result, the promotion and integration of smart houses with other smarter elements of cities could archive a significant enhancement of the quality of life and a stronger urban sustainability.",

Using 2006 and 2007 American Community Surveys, individual instrumental variable and state-level difference-in-difference models (following the same cohort over time) control for self-selection and find a positive effect of employment on adolescent fertility. National Vital Statistics birth data confirm state-level results. Results for fertility (and some evidence for other early transitions) indicate that youth employment speeds the transition to adulthood, supporting life course theory.

		"abstract": "Background Although telehealth offers an improved approach to providing healthcare services, its adoption by end users remains slow. With an older population as the main target, these traditionally conservative users pose a big challenge to the successful implementation of innovative telehealth services. Objectives The objective of this study was to develop and empirically test a model for predicting the factors affecting older users’ acceptance of Home Telehealth Services (HTS). Methods A survey instrument was administered to 400 participants aged 50 years and above from both rural and urban environments in Slovenia. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the causal effect of seven hypothesized predicting factors. HTS were introduced as a bundle of functionalities, representing future services that currently do not exist. This enabled users’ perceptions to be measured on the conceptual level, rather than attitudes to a specific technical solution. Results Six relevant predictors were confirmed in older users’ HTS acceptance behavior, with Performance Expectancy (r=0.30), Effort Expectancy (r=0.49), Facilitating Conditions (r=0.12), and Perceived Security (r=0.16) having a direct impact on behavioral intention to use HTS. In addition, Computer Anxiety is positioned as an antecedent of Effort Expectancy with a strong negative influence (r=−0.61), and Doctor’s Opinion influence showed a strong impact on Performance Expectancy (r=0.31). The results also indicate Social Influence as an irrelevant predictor of acceptance behavior. The model of six predictors yielded 77% of the total variance explained in the final measured Behavioral Intention to Use HTS by older adults. Conclusion The level at which HTS are perceived as easy to use and manage is the leading acceptance predictor in older users’ HTS acceptance. Together with Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Security, these three factors represent the key influence on older people’s HTS acceptance behavior. When promoting HTS, interventions should focus to portray it as secure. Marketing interventions should focus also on promoting HTS among health professionals, using them as social agents to frame the services as useful and beneficial. The important role of computer anxiety may result in a need to use different equipment such as a tablet computer to access HTS. Finally, this paper introduces important methodological guidelines for measuring perceptions on a conceptual level of future services that currently do not exist.",

This paper aims to describe the implementation, as well as benefits and barriers of eHealth applications in integrated care programs targeting people with multimorbidity in European countries, including insights on older people 65+. Methods Within the framework of the ICARE4EU project, in 2014, expert organizations in 24 European countries identified 101 integrated care programs based on selected inclusion criteria. Managers of these programs completed a related on-line questionnaire addressing various aspects including the use of eHealth. In this paper we analyze data from this questionnaire, in addition to qualitative information from six programs which were selected as ‘high potential’ for their innovative approach and studied in depth through site visits. Results Out of 101 programs, 85 adopted eHealth applications, of which 42 focused explicitly on older people. In most cases Electronic Health Records (EHRs), registration databases with patients’ data and tools for communication between care providers were implemented. Percentages were slightly higher for programs addressing older people. eHealth improves care integration and management processes. Inadequate funding mechanisms, interoperability and technical support represent major barriers. Conclusion Findings seems to suggest that eHealth could support integrated care for (older) people with multimorbidity.",

		"abstract": "Objective Frailty, a clinical syndrome associated with loss of metabolic reserves, is prevalent among patients who present to vascular surgery clinics for evaluation. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a rapid assessment method shown to be highly specific for identifying frail patients. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether the preoperative CFS score could be used to predict loss of independence after major vascular procedures. Methods We identified all patients living independently at home who were prospectively assessed using the CFS before undergoing an elective major vascular surgery procedure (admitted for >24 hours) at an academic medical center between December 2015 and December 2017. Patient- and procedure-level clinical data were obtained from our institutional Vascular Quality Initiative registry database. The composite outcome of discharge to a nonhome location or 30-day mortality was evaluated using bivariate and multivariate regression models. Results A total of 134 independent patients were assessed using the CFS before they underwent elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (8%), endovascular aneurysm repair (26%), thoracic endovascular aortic repair (6%), suprainguinal bypass (6%), infrainguinal bypass (16%), carotid endarterectomy (19%), or peripheral vascular intervention (20%). Among 39 (29%) individuals categorized as being frail using the CFS, there was no significant difference in age or American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status compared with nonfrail patients. However, frail patients were significantly more likely to need mobility assistance after surgery (62% frail vs 22% nonfrail; P < .01) and to be discharged to a nonhome location (22% frail vs 6% nonfrail; P = .01) or to die within 30 days after surgery (8% frail vs 0% nonfrail; P < .01). Preoperative frailty was associated with a >12-fold higher risk (odds ratio, 12.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-66.96; P < .01) of 30-day mortality or loss of independence, independent of the vascular procedure undertaken. Conclusions The CFS is a practical tool for assessing preoperative frailty among patients undergoing elective major vascular surgery and can be used to predict likelihood of requiring discharge to a nursing facility or death after surgery. The identification of frail patients before major surgery can help manage postoperative expectations and optimize transitions of care.",

Even though the study of modularity in areas other than goods production is increasing, little is known about interfaces outside the context of modular goods. From our case research, it follows that interfaces can be distinguished at the component level (linkages between components’ contents) and at the service package level (linkages between service providers involved). The contribution of the paper is a first typology on interfaces in modular services. Four interface categories are distinguished, which offer a specification of the interfaces’ function in creating variety and coherence, when linking content components as well as service providers. In addition, we provide a new definition of interfaces for services that differs from the accepted manufacturing definition.",

Children whose parents were reported as regularly visiting and working toward regaining custody (reciprocity) were more likely to be reunified and less likely to be replaced than children whose parents were reported as non-cooperative with visitation and service plans. Controlling for reciprocity, children were also less likely to be replaced if caregivers retained the full foster care subsidy (payment), reported a good relationship with the child (empathy), and grew-up in the American South and attended church regularly (duty). The sensitivity of these findings to alternative specifications of the competing risks of foster care replacement and kinship transfers is reported.",

Physical and cognitive abilities may decline, and thus, elderly people may experience several problems that hinder them from travelling independently. One of the most difficult issues when addressing the problem of age-related travel restrictions is the heterogeneity of the ageing population. SOULMATE offers a non-intrusive and personalized mobility package that evolves with the end-user across his/her different life stages to ensure him/her to make secure trips. SOULMATE aggregates three types of mobility support: Indoor virtual training of a route, active routing during trips and monitoring by a coach at a distance during trips. For each individual, the desired or necessary functionalities can be chosen, based on his/her specific abilities and travel needs. The SOULMATE solution will be developed iteratively, in co-creation with end-users and stakeholders, and the package will be tested intensively, and evaluated in three countries (Belgium, The Netherlands and Austria) based on usability, technical and business aspects.",

		"abstract": "In Canada where long-term care is primarily oriented to elderly persons and affordable accessible housing is limited, younger disabled adults may be living in circumstances that do not meet their health needs and contribute to their social exclusion. The purpose of this study was to undertake an ethical analysis of what constitute an ‘adequate’ home environment for adults with significant mobility disabilities. An integrated design was used that combined qualitative interviews with normative ethical analysis in an iterative process. Twenty interviews with 19 participants were conducted in Ontario, Canada with two groups: younger adults (ages 18–55) with mobility disabilities and ‘decision-makers’ who consisted of policy makers, program administrators and discharge planners. Data were analyzed using a critical disability ethics approach and processes of reflective equilibrium. Drawing on Nora Jacobson’s (Jacobson, 2009) taxonomy of dignity and pluralistic approaches to social justice, the concept of ‘social dignity’ provides a lens for exploring the adequacy of home environments for disabled people. Analyses suggested seven threshold conditions necessary for a dignity-enabling home: the ability to form and sustain meaningful relationships; access to community and civic life; access to control and flexibility of daily activities; access to opportunities for self-expression and identity affirmation; access to respectful relationships with attendants; access to opportunities to participate in school, work or leisure; access to physical, psychological and ontological security. The results have implications for housing, health and social care policies, and political reform. Social dignity provides a normative ethical grounding for assessing the adequacy of home environments. The threshold elements outline specific dignity-enabling conditions that are open to further specification or elaboration in different contexts.",

With UK central government reducing budgets for local authorities, and increasing pressure from societal challenges including an ageing population, the HLS offered a speculative design space to reconfigure possible co-designed service futures. Visual ethnographic processes, framed within anthropological concepts of locality and place, traced the routes travelled and the interactions that were enacted between the HLS team members and its housebound readers, revealing the hidden nature of the relationships and knowledge that existed across the borough. I conclude that as governments look to reconfigure services—and often do so using abstract policy language—new frames of understanding of locality and place must be explored to deliver digital solutions that amplify the social and cultural dimensions that constitute a community.",

The study team, which includes patients, clinical researchers, front-line provider and policy maker stakeholders, has been working together for over a decade to develop interventions that target improvements for US trauma care systems nationally. This pragmatic randomized trial compares a multidisciplinary team collaborative care intervention that integrates front-line trauma center staff with peer interventionists, versus trauma team notification of patient emotional distress with mental health consultation as enhanced usual care. The peer-integrated collaborative care intervention will be supported by a novel emergency department exchange health information technology platform. A total of 424 patients will be randomized to peer-integrated collaborative care (n = 212) and surgical team notification (n = 212) conditions. The study hypothesizes that patients randomized to peer integrated collaborative care intervention will demonstrate significant reductions in emergency department health service utilization, severity of patient concerns, post traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and physical limitations when compared to surgical team notification. These four primary outcomes will be followed-up at 1- 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months after injury for all patients. The Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) method will be used to assess implementation processes. Data from the primary outcome analysis and implementation process assessment will be used to inform an end-of-study policy summit with the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.

A large portion of the variance, the probability of psychiatric hospitalization and length of stay, is explainable by prior service history, clinical symptoms and presenting problems of the client observed while in the community. This suggests that, for an outpatient treated population, the risk and duration of psychiatric hospitalization episodes can be ascertained prospectively and resources targeted appropriately. Additionally, the study shows that the factors associated with one event, i.e. hospitalization, do not necessarily influence the other, i.e. LOS, suggesting that a reliable model for predicting high-risk clients requires the incorporation of both events, simultaneously.",

		"abstract": "Summary Objective In order to develop a hand assessment questionnaire for a population survey, a systematic review was undertaken of measures of hand disability. The purpose of this review was to identify valid measures to evaluate hand osteoarthritis (HOA) in the general population and primary care and to perform a quality appraisal of them. Method Measurement tools were identified from an online search of databases (Medline, CINAHL and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), 1990–2002) restricted to English language and adult population. Search terms combined “osteoarthritis” and “arthritis” with “hand” and [“function” or “disability” or “outcome”]. Instruments used in the evaluation of HOA were identified following application of strict eligibility criteria. The use of these tools in HOA was rated by pairs of independent reviewers according to criteria developed by the Medical Outcomes Trust. Results The initial search yielded a list of articles which were not mutually exclusive (ISI, 127; Medline, 64; CINAHL, 61). Full journal articles were ordered from relevant abstracts (ISI, 28; Medline, 3; CINAHL, 5). Further hand searching of articles produced an additional 34 references. A total of 61 references were identified, 18 measurement tools, 5 of which met the inclusion criteria [Algofunctional Index (FIHOA), Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 (AIMS2), Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN), Cochin]. Overall, the AIMS2 and AUSCAN were more highly rated than the FIHOA, Cochin and HAQ. Conclusions The aim of this review was not to recommend any one instrument over another but to provide an overall summary of the robustness of commonly used measures. The choice of instrument will depend on many factors, and will differ from project to project depending on the question asked.",

Focusing on the nations two largest immigrant gateways, pooled data from the 2005–2007 American Community Surveys show that there are significant racial–ethnic differences, which are even more marked when immigrant generation is taken into account. Further analysis confirms that residential arrangements are related to adult social roles and personal resources, and controlling for roles and resources eliminates the Black-White gap in parental co-residence. Several predictors, such as personal income and marital status, display distinctive patterns for the different racial and ethnic groups.",

		"abstract": "Due to their histories of caregiver maltreatment, living instability, and potential attachment challenges associated with out-of-home care, older foster youth represent a particularly vulnerable group of adolescents at increased risk for a number of poor well-being outcomes. However, research supports the notion that a relationship with a competent, caring adult, such as a mentor, may serve protectively for vulnerable youth, and a nascent yet growing body of literature suggests that naturally occurring mentoring relationships from within youths social networks are associated with improved outcomes among young people in foster care during adolescence and the transition to adulthood. This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify, synthesize, and summarize what we currently know from nearly a decade of theories, concepts, and research findings pertaining to natural mentoring among adolescent youth in foster care. A bibliographic search of seven databases and personal outreach to mentoring researchers and practitioners through a national listserv yielded 38 English-language documents from academic sources and the gray literature pertaining to natural mentoring among older foster youth. We identified quantitative studies that have been conducted to test the theories and hypotheses that have emerged from the qualitative studies of natural mentoring among youth in foster care. Together, this literature suggests that natural mentoring is a promising practice for youth in foster care. Based on our findings from the systematic review, we make practice recommendations to encourage the facilitation of natural mentoring within child welfare contexts and outline an agenda for future research that more rigorously investigates natural mentoring among older youth in foster care.",

Structured, self-report, anonymous questionnaires were completed by 1324 Israeli Arab and Jewish adolescents, aged 11 to 19, residing in 32 RCSs for children at risk. The mediation model was performed using bootstrap in SPSS. The findings reveal a negative significant association between the adolescents perceived social climate (which included the following aspects: staff support, staff strictness, childrens behavior, childrens friendliness, and satisfaction with the RCS) and overall adjustment difficulties, as well as a negative significant association between social climate and peer physical victimization experiences in the RCS. In addition, it was found that peer physical victimization experiences have a mediating role in the link between social climate and adjustment difficulties. In other words, the path between the RCS social climate and adolescents adjustment difficulties is weaker after including the mediating influence of victimization by peers. The results of the current study emphasize the need to examine the contribution of various characteristics of the stay experience, rather than focusing solely on personal characteristics and family history to enhance our understanding of the variance in adjustment difficulties of adolescents in RCS.",

Results indicate that exposure during adolescence to family instability, parental cohabitation, lower parental SES, and low family belonging were associated with an elevated likelihood of entering into cohabiting unions, but primarily during adolescence and early adulthood.

Comparison of the literature on outcomes in children with CP published in 2002 with studies published 10 years earlier demonstrates an increased number of studies and a wider range of outcome measures used to characterize the functioning of these children. A better understanding of the extent and nature of the outcomes and their determinants is critical to guide clinical decision making and program planning to maximize community integration, social participation, and overall well-being of the child and family.",

		"abstract": "Initiatives that bridge the fields of ageing and disability are considered critical internationally but to be limited in practice. Taking Ireland as a case, and focusing on social care, this article reports on a study investigating the separate organization of older peoples and disability services as perceived by those working in policy-making, service provision and advocacy. In Ireland, as in many countries, social care is administered separately for disabled people and older people. Perceptions of those working in social care are thought to play a role in successful boundary-crossing initiatives. This study suggests that while participants often perceived the administrative and funding boundary between the fields of ageing and disability as illogical, inflexible, and not delivering person-centred care or support, the divide between the two sectors is underpinned by conceptual issues, including the lack of a concept of disability with ageing. The article argues that ways are needed of articulating what it is to experience disability in older age that are shared between older peoples and disability sectors. It discusses bio-psychosocial models of disability as a means of doing so, one that avoids a return to an equation between older age and impairment, disability or decline. It concludes that more interrogation is needed of the separate philosophical underpinnings of disability and older peoples sectors, argues for greater linkages between the two fields and for more exploration of social constructions of the experience of disability in later life.",

Based on previous social medical studies, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for the mechanistic links between neighborhood housing deprivation and public health; and then quantifies their associations at district level in the case of Shenzhen, China. Data at district level in 2010 are collected for five health outcomes (cardiopathy, chronic pneumonia, general physical fitness, liver cancer, and mental health hospitalizations). Using varimax rotated principle component analysis, we establish an integrated neighborhood housing deprivation index (INHDI) by combining six domains of variables that comprehensively reflect the housing disadvantage (internal facilities, living space, physical form and structure, attached facilities, affiliated natural amenities, affordability). Spatial regression is employed to quantify the association between INHDI and public health, using income, occupation and education as control variables. Results show that housing deprivation acts as a significant exploratory factor for all the health outcomes. Variances decomposition shows that the individual contribution of housing deprivation is stronger than that of socioeconomic disadvantage for cardiopathy, chronic pneumonia and liver cancer. Differently, general physical fitness and mental health hospitalizations are more subjected to the joint impacts of housing deprivation and socioeconomic disadvantage. Path analysis demonstrates that the casual pathways between housing deprivation and public health are quite complex. The developed INHDI can serve as a practical tool to facilitate urban planning with health considerations. This study captures the nuanced health disparities varied with housing deprivation, and therefore produces some more generalized knowledge that ultimately help develop housing construction plans aimed at promoting public health.",

		"abstract": "The increasing health burdens pose great challenge for planners and policy makers to create a more livable city. Recent literature has linked land use to a wide range of illness and death causes in developed nations. It therefore requires evidence-driven and replicable frameworks to inform land use decisions that integrate with health promotion. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the mechanistic links between neighborhood land use and public health; and then quantifies their associations at district level, using the case of Shenzhen in developing China. Data for 15 health indicators in 2010 are collected at district level; and a set of standardized land use variables (individual land use type, general land use mix, and physical street conditions) are proposed to comprehensively reflect the neighborhood land use characteristics. Spatial regression is employed to analyze the relationships between health outcomes and land use variables. Results show that the land use exploratory variables vary with health indicators, but several key land use determinants are identified: green land abundance, green land morphology, institutional land proximity, industrial land proximity, blue land abundance, street walkability and street connectivity. Structural equation modeling is further applied to examine the possible mediators and it demonstrates that the casual pathways between land use and public health are quite complex. The developed set of standardized land use variables can serve as practical tools to facilitate land use decisions with health considerations. In practice, several complexities at governance levels challenge the efforts to reconnect land use policies and public health promotion. We put forward three useful solutions to enhancing health connection with land use policy across different international settings. This study captures the nuanced health disparities varied with districts and indicators, and therefore produces some more generalized knowledge that ultimately helps develop land use policies aimed at promoting public health at home and abroad.",

Next, characteristics of teens initial relapse in terms of substances involved, situational context, and factors associated with relapse are described.

		"abstract": "A growing global population of older adults is potential consumers of a category of products referred to as smart technologies, but also known as telehealth, telecare, information and communication technologies, robotics, and gerontechnology. This paper constructs a theoretical model to explain whether older people will adopt smart technology options to cope with their discrepant individual or environmental circumstances, thereby enabling them to age in place. Its proposed constructs and relationships are drawn from multiple academic disciplines and professional specialties, and an extensive literature focused on the factors influencing the acceptance of these smart technologies. It specifically examines whether older adults will substitute these new technologies for traditional coping solutions that rely on informal and formal care assistance and low technology related products. The model argues that older people will more positively evaluate smart technology alternatives when they feel more stressed because of their unmet needs, have greater resilience (stronger perceptions of self-efficacy and greater openness to new information), and are more strongly persuaded by their sources of outside messaging (external information) and their past experiences (internal information). It proposes that older people distinguish three attributes of these coping options when they appraise them: perceived efficaciousness, perceived usability, and perceived collateral damages. The more positively older people evaluate these attributes, the more likely that they will adopt these smart technology products.",

		"abstract": "Introduction There is limited understanding of how burn injuries at different ages are associated with normal growth and development as well as the burn recovery process. This study provides new useful insights by comparing social participation outcomes among burn survivors injured in childhood compared with injuries sustained in middle age, and older adulthood. Methods Items from the development of the LIBRE profile were administered to 601 adult burn survivors with ≥5% TBSA burned or burns to critical areas (hands, feet, face, or genitals). Each item was answered on a 5-point Likert scale with higher scores denoting better outcomes. Mean scores for the 6 LIBRE profile scales (sexual relationships, family and friends, social interactions, social activities, work and employment, and romantic relationships) were compared between those burned as children (<18years) and those burned as adults (≥18years). Regression analyses were used to assess differences between groups with adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Of the 597 burn survivors having complete data on age at injury, 165 (27.6%) sustained burn injuries as a child. Those burned as children were more frequently female than those burned as adults (57% vs 47%) and were also more frequently white non-Hispanic (89% vs 77%). Marital status and education level were similar in the two groups. Those who were burned as children had slightly higher scores on the social activities, work and employment and romantic relationships scales. However, these differences did not persist in adjusted regression analyses. Conclusions Burn survivors who sustained injuries as a child fared at least as well as those burned as adults in a broad range of long-term social participation outcomes. The impact on long-term social participation outcomes of burn survivors was not significantly different between individuals with burns sustained during important developmental stages at young ages and those injured later in life.",

		"abstract": "The current North American successful aging movement offers a particular normative model of how to age well, one tied to specific notions of individualist personhood especially valued in North America emphasizing independence, productivity, self-maintenance, and the individual self as project. This successful aging paradigm, with its various incarnations as active, healthy and productive aging, has received little scrutiny as to its cultural assumptions. Drawing on fieldwork data with elders from both India and the United States, this article offers an analysis of cultural assumptions underlying the North American successful aging paradigm as represented in prevailing popular and scientific discourse on how to age well. Four key themes in this public successful aging discourse are examined: individual agency and control; maintaining productive activity; the value of independence and importance of avoiding dependence; and permanent personhood, a vision of the ideal person as not really aging at all in late life, but rather maintaining the self of ones earlier years. Although the majority of the (Boston-area, well-educated, financially privileged) US elders making up this study, and some of the most cosmopolitan Indians, embrace and are inspired by the ideals of the successful aging movement, others critique the prevailing successful aging model for insufficiently incorporating attention to and acceptance of the human realities of mortality and decline. Ultimately, the article argues that the vision offered by the dominant successful aging paradigm is not only a particular cultural and biopolitical model but, despite its inspirational elements, in some ways a counterproductive one. Successful aging discourse might do well to come to better terms with conditions of human transience and decline, so that not all situations of dependence, debility and even mortality in late life will be viewed and experienced as “failures” in living well.",

Methods Qualitative analyses of open-ended individual interviews averaging 41 min with 20 Massachusetts physicians from 5 different subspecialties, in practice for 8–51 years. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim for conventional content analysis. Results Most participants defined disability using medically-focused concepts rather than concepts that recognize how social factors contribute to disability. All participants used disability culturally-competent language, such as “person-first language,” at some points throughout their interviews. However, most participants also employed language that is now considered unacceptable or archaic, such as variations on the word “handicap,” “wheelchair-bound,” describing persons with disability as “suffering,” and calling persons by their health condition (e.g., “COPDer”). Participants mentioned persons with mental illness and intellectual disability as particularly challenging, especially around communication and performing even routine tests or examinations. Recommendations for improving care included better listening to patients with disability and seeking their views about their care. Conclusions In this exploratory study, most participants used language that is considered disability culturally competent at times but also employed many terms and concepts that are considered outdated and may be troubling to some persons with disability.",

		"abstract": "Purpose Developmentally sensitive measures of vision-related quality of life (VQoL) are needed to capture age-specific concerns about the impact of living with visual impairment (VI) in children and young people. Our objective was to use our validated VQoL instrument for children and young people 10 to 15 years of age (the VQoL_CYP) as the foundation for development of age-specific extensions. Design Questionnaire development. Participants A representative sample of children and young people 6 to 19 years of age with VI, defined as visual acuity worse than 0.50 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution in the better eye. They were recruited from pediatric ophthalmology clinics at Great Ormond Street Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospital and, in the final phase of the study, from 20 additional United Kingdom hospitals. Methods Standard instrument development processes were followed across 4 phases. Twenty-nine semistructured interviews with children and young people permitted draft age-appropriate extensions. Twenty-eight cognitive interviews informed items and response options. Age-appropriate extensions were prepiloted with 49 participants to ensure feasibility and administered via a postal survey to a national sample of 160 participants for psychometric evaluation using Rasch analysis. Construct validity was evaluated through correlations with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Main Outcome Measures Psychometric indices of validity and reliability of the instrument versions. Results Interviews confirmed that the existing VQoL_CYP content and format were relevant across a wider age range. Age-appropriate extensions were drafted for children (8–12 years) and young people (13–17 years). Psychometric item reduction produced 20-item child and 22-item young person versions, each with acceptable fit values, no notable differential item functioning, good measurement precision, ordered response categories and acceptable targeting, and no notable differential item functioning on items common to both. Construct validity was demonstrated through correlations with health-related quality of life (r = 0.698). Conclusions Using an efficient child- and young person–centered approach, we developed 2 robust, age-appropriate versions of an instrument capturing VQoL that can be used cross-sectionally or sequentially across the age range of 8 to 17 years in research and clinical practice. This approach may be applicable in other rare childhood ophthalmic disorders.",

This study explored the relationship between several presurgical psychosocial characteristics and postsurgical quality-of-life outcomes. The study aimed to develop the concept of ‘the burden of normality’ and identify risk factors for a poor psychosocial outcome that could be targeted with ameliorative presurgery cognitive behavioral techniques. Data were collected from 77 epilepsy surgery patients from three UK epilepsy centers and presurgery and postsurgery follow-up data were obtained from 30–34 patients, depending on the measure. Measures were self-report. Postsurgery intervals were determined by the epilepsy surgery care pathway at individual centers. Presurgery poor levels of mental health, poor social functioning, increased belief in illness chronicity, and associating epilepsy with social role limitations were all associated with poor postsurgical quality of life. Adopting an accepting coping strategy presurgery was associated with good postoperative quality of life. Regression analysis showed that a good postsurgical quality of life was positively predicted by a presurgical coping style of being able to make the best of a situation and see challenges in a positive light (i.e., positive reinterpretation and growth from the COPE scale) and negatively predicted by presurgical levels of anxiety. These data are presented as an important step in identifying psychological red flags for an adverse psychosocial outcome to epilepsy surgery, as exemplified by the concept of the ‘burden of normality’ and specifying targets for preoperative ameliorative psychological advice.",

The rise of medical dominance in society is related to the medical dominance of physiotherapy and the implications of this on the development of physiotherapy theory. Three theoretical models cited in the literature are examined in detail – the medical model, the social model, and holism – and the implications of their adoption as a basis for physiotherapy practice is discussed. The close relationship between the medical model and physiotherapy is examined and an argument made that before the profession decides to abandon it as a basis for practice the implications of that are understood and debated. The danger inherent in adopting any existing model as an alternative is addressed, and the third option of developing a physiotherapeutic model, unique to the profession, advocated. This paper has been developed from a shorter paper presented at the international conference ‘The Science and Art of Physiotherapy’ in Hong Kong in July 1993.",

		"abstract": "Adverse adulthood outcomes are well documented among youth who age out of foster care. However, not all youth who age out of care experience deleterious adult outcomes, despite struggling with similar challenges during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Childhood maltreatment, which places youth at greater risk for later maladaptive functioning and psychopathology, may partially explain poor adjustment outcomes in adulthood. Similarly, a history of unstable placements and residing in institutional congregate care settings may also contribute to hardship during this time. However, none of these factors help to explain how some young people aging out of care manage to achieve stability while transitioning into adulthood. This article reviews the literature through the lens of the identity capital framework, and discusses the applicability of this framework to the experiences of youth aging out of foster care.",

Findings indicate that individual-level characteristics account for a small proportion of the variability. The states child welfare agency is administered at the state level and organized regionally. Dependency courts are organized primarily at the county level. An analysis of state child welfare and juvenile court administrative data shows that a significant level of variation in retention rates is found at the county level, suggesting that court-level practice may be influencing the variability evinced by Illinois. Institutional theory and Lipskys street-level bureaucracy framework illuminate how courts may be an important source of variation, and a potential target for policy intervention to extend care to more youth.",

		"abstract": "Whilst researchers and professionals recognise that mobile health (M-health) systems offer unprecedented opportunities, most existing work has comprised individual project-based developments in specialised areas. Existing review articles generally utilise medical literature and categories: none investigates M-health from an information systems (IS) design point of view. Identifying application areas, design issues and IS research techniques will demonstrate models, issues, approaches and gaps to inform future research. A comprehensive analysis of the literature from this viewpoint is thus valuable, both for theoretical progression and for guiding real-world innovative system developments. Drawing from key IS and healthcare multidisciplinary journals we analyse recent (2010–2016) articles concerning M-health application developments and their associated design or development issues, with particular focus on the use of contemporary research methods. Our analysis suggests that M-health is an emerging field to which, although underused, contemporary approaches such as design science research are particularly appropriate. We identify eight application categories, eleven design issues (security, privacy, literacy, accessibility, acceptability, reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, knowledge sharing and flexibility) as well as the stakeholders and development techniques involved. This goes beyond previous frameworks, and theoretically integrates the central role of IS design within the sub-field.",

Design Community-based participatory research partnership among a research team, a consortium of 11 stakeholder organizations, and others. Methods included literature review, item generation and reduction, cognitive testing, field testing, exploratory factor analysis, and convergent and discriminant validity testing. Setting Cognitive testing conducted in 2 AL residences and field testing conducted in 19 diverse, stratified AL residences in 6 states. Participants Eight residents and staff participated in cognitive testing, and 228 residents and 123 staff participated in field testing. Measurements Feasibility and psychometric testing of draft questionnaires that included 75 items (resident version) and 102 items (staff version), with parallel items on both versions as appropriate. Results The final resident questionnaire included 49 items and 4 factors: well-being and belonging, individualized care and services, social connectedness, and atmosphere. The staff questionnaire included 62 items and 5 factors: workforce practices, social connectedness, individualized care and services, atmosphere, and caregiver-resident relationships. Staff scored person-centeredness higher than did residents, reflecting their different perspectives. Conclusion The Person-Centered Practices in Assisted Living (PC-PAL) questionnaires measure person-centeredness from the perspectives of residents and staff, meaning that they reflect the concepts and items considered to be important to these key stakeholders. Use of these instruments to describe, assess, quantify, ensure, and ultimately improve person-centeredness in AL is feasible and appropriate for all AL settings, and supported by numerous national organizations.",

		"abstract": "Delinquency of street children in China is prevalent, but the etiology of pathways into delinquency among street children in China has yet to be explored. By drawing on in-depth interviews with 40 street children in Kunming, China, this paper investigates the processes that lead street children to become involved in crime. The research finds that street childrens pathways to delinquency occurs via three stages: (1) initial attempts to make a living through conventional activities; (2) involvement in the informal economic activity as a middle solution; and (3) engaging in instrumental crime as a last resort. Delinquent behavior is thus street childrens natural adaptation when access to legitimate survival opportunities are eliminated by institutional exclusion to the formal labor market and because of the governments efforts to tackle child homelessness which often have negative consequences for children living on the streets. This reflects both anomie/strain theory and resilient perspectives, and this research constructs a model of anomie, resilience and crime. The article concludes by arguing that policy and practical implications for reducing street children crime in China should focus on providing life and work opportunities and help to raise awareness of street children in China and the mechanisms they use to assist their survival on the streets.",

		"abstract": "As a consequence of the political, social, and economic developments in contemporary China, there have been considerable changes in the patterns of flows of social support between Chinese older people and their significant others. There is evidence that Chinese elders are now under strong pressure to provide more social support, instrumental support in particular, to their children and other relatives while they receive less. Such a change in the direction of flows of social support has been reported to worsen the elders health. This paper describes the general pattern of social support both to and from the Chinese elders, using data of a probability sample survey conducted in Wuhan, China in 1991. The association between social support, both receiving and providing, and old-age health status is also analysed within a multivariate framework. The results of two probit models suggest that emotional support received plays a crucial role in affecting an elders health status, while instrumental support received does not have explicit impacts. In addition, there is no empirical evidence that increased instrumental support from elders has worsened their health status as reported.",

This paper presents the rationale and design for a randomized clinical trial of a novel interdisciplinary program to reduce disability among low income older adults based on a previous pilot trial of the same design showing strong effect. Methods The CAPABLE (Community Aging in Place, Advancing Better Living for Elders) trial is a randomized controlled trial in which low income older adults with self-care disability are assigned to one of two groups: an interdisciplinary team of a nurse, occupational therapist, and handyman to address both personal and environmental risk factors for disability based on participants functional goals, or an attention control of sedentary activities of choice. Both groups receive up to 10 home visits over 4months. Outcomes The primary outcome is decreased disability in self-care (ADL). Secondary outcomes are sustained decrease in self care disability as well as improvement in instrumental ADLS, strength, balance, walking speed, and health care utilization. Careful cost tracking and analysis using intervention data and claims data will enable direct measurement of the cost impact of the CAPABLE approach. CAPABLE has the potential to leverage current health care spending in Medicaid waivers, Accountable Care Organizations and other capitated systems to save the health care system costs as well as improving low income older adults ability to age at home with improved life quality.",

Methods This study examined service utilization and expenditures provided by regional centers to individuals with DD living at home and in residential settings in California in 2004–2005. Logistic regressions of secondary data were used to predict the receipt of services, and ordinary least squares regressions were used to examine the predictors of service expenditures. Results Of the 175,595 individuals assessed with DD, 21% did not receive any purchased services from regional centers in 2004–2005. Controlling for client needs, individuals aged 3–21 years were less likely than other age groups to receive services. All racial and ethnic minority groups were less likely to receive any services than were whites. The supply of intermediate care facilities for habilitation and residential care reduced the likelihood of receiving regional center services. Of those who received services, younger individuals and all racial and ethnic minority groups had significantly lower expenditures. Provider supply, area population characteristics, and regional centers also predicted variation in service use and expenditures. Conclusion The disparities by age, race/ethnicity, and geographic area require further study, and specific approaches are needed to ensure equity in access to services.",

		"abstract": "This study explores how foster care experiences can impact support network functionality as young people exit the foster care system. This can be conceptualized as a function of both network member capacity to provide adequate support to address young adult needs, and network stability, which reflects cohesion within and across relationships to facilitate consistent support over time. We conducted support network mapping and semi-structured interviews with youth in foster care aged 16–20 (N = 22) and used theoretical thematic analysis to explore support barriers and facilitators in relation to the organizing concepts of support capacity and network stability. Overall, support capacity was limited by interpersonal difficulties inhibiting the presence and supportiveness of some network members (including family members, informal peer and community-based connections, and caseworkers), whereas network stability facilitated multidimensional support through strong and interconnected relationships with caregivers and service providers. Emergent network patterns reflected distinct subgroups of more and less functional support networks, and strategies for network enhancement focus on promoting youth-directed services and support, developing youth skills and opportunities to invest in informal relationships, and using network assessment to identify unmet support needs. Findings advance a framework for understanding how foster care impacts support network characteristics, and inform ongoing efforts to address resulting limitations through services and programming.",

		"abstract": "This article presents a theoretical framework of empowerment evaluation, addresses methodological issues and suggests operational considerations for evaluators who wish to implement empowerment evaluation. The discussion of these issues reflects the authors experience in facilitating evaluations of human service programs so as to maximize participation by the users. The roots of empowerment evaluation extend to participation theory with the premise that the more participation in decision-making processes the participants have, the likelier they become to commit to and invest in the decisions. Empowerment evaluation provides evaluators with creative approaches to maximizing an evaluations usefulness, requiring them to play diverse roles as trainers, facilitators, advocates and co-liberators as prescribed by Fetterman, 1994. Major benefits of empowerment evaluation include the increased relevance and utility of the evaluation and its tendency to empower the participants of the evaluation. The benefits of empowerment evaluation outweigh such limitations as the overemphasis of face validity and the longer time required for its implementation. These benefits are particularly important in the field of human services where the empowerment of consumers is critical.",

		"abstract": "The present review discusses the current state of research on the clinical neuropsychology of prospective memory in Parkinsons disease. To do so the paper is divided in two sections. In the first section, we briefly outline key features of the (partly implicit) rationale underlying the available literature on the clinical neuropsychology of prospective memory. Here, we present a conceptual model that guides our approach to the clinical neuropsychology of prospective memory in general and to the effects of Parkinsons disease on prospective memory in particular. In the second section, we use this model to guide our review of the available literature and suggest some open issues and future directions motivated by previous findings and the proposed conceptual model. The review suggests that certain phases of the prospective memory process (intention formation und initiation) are particularly impaired by Parkinsons disease. In addition, it is argued that prospective memory may be preserved when tasks involve specific features (e.g., focal cues) that reduce the need for strategic monitoring processes. In terms of suggestions for future directions, it is noted that intervention studies are needed which target the specific phases of the prospective memory process that are impaired in Parkinsons disease, such as planning interventions. Moreover, it is proposed that prospective memory deficits in Parkinsons disease should be explored in the context of a general impairment in the ability to form an intention and plan or coordinate an appropriate series of actions.",

The achievement of higher stages of the recovery was correlated with: less severe symptoms of psychosis (with the exception of anxiety and depression, which have no impact on the stages of recovery), medical attribution (I am ill), integrative attitude toward the experience of psychosis, and the absence of involuntary hospitalizations. The logistic regression analysis model indicated the independent significance of the medical attribution, the integrating attitude toward psychotic experience and the remission of symptoms. Other clinical variables and social characteristics did not differentiate between the stages of recovery in any significant way. No juxtaposition as such was found between the processes of recovery and being ill, but rather a complementary relation.

		"abstract": "In the post-1996 welfare reform period in the U.S., disability assistance has become a significant source of government aid for low-income residents as other forms of public support have faced considerable reductions and restrictions. In order to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) – a means-tested assistance program that provides income stipends to qualified residents – working-age individuals with disabilities must have little income and resources, and procure medical documentation that confirms that they are unable to work due to a disability. The result of rising SSI enrollment in the face of cutbacks to other government programs is the increasing medicalization of welfare, whereby receipt of welfare benefits is contingent on a medical diagnosis of disability. Using county-level data from the American Community Survey and the Social Security Administration, this paper examines the changing spatial patterns of SSI participation of the working-age population in 2000 and 2010 across the U.S. in addition to the interconnections between disability, welfare, and poverty. Results from spatial analyses illustrate geographic variation in SSI prevalence, with distinctive spatial clusters of higher than average SSI participation in the southeast and Appalachian regions of the U.S. and in northern California. Multiple linear regression model results reveal that SSI participation is significantly correlated with disability, poverty, race, family type, and level of education in both 2000 and 2010. The findings suggest that spatial concentrations of disability, poverty, and underemployment persist in largely rural areas. The discussion explores the potential social and economic implications of long-term SSI clustering on localities and residents, and points to future research directions.",

Description of intervention The general principles of ACE included an approach to care guided by the biopsychosocial model and recognition of the importance of fitting the hospital environment to the patient’s needs. The design of the intervention was consistent with principles of comprehensive geriatric assessment and continuous quality improvement. Care, which focused on maintaining function, was directed by an interdisciplinary team that considered the patient’s needs both at home and in the hospital. The major components of the ACE Unit intervention included patient-centered nursing care (daily assessment of functional needs by nursing, nursing-based protocols to improve outcomes, daily rounds by a multidisciplinary team), a prepared environment, planning for discharge, and medical care review. Results In a randomized trial comparing ACE with usual care, patients receiving ACE had improved functional outcomes at discharge. The costs to the hospital for ACE unit care were less than for usual care. The functional status of ACE and usual care patients was similar 90 days after discharge. Future directions The ACE unit intervention is being expanded to preserve the improvements observed during the hospitalization in the outpatient setting. In addition, needs other than function which are critical to patients’ long-term quality of life are being considered.",

		"abstract": "This study examines two regional youth welfare agencies in different parts of the world that have independently from each other begun to redevelop their organisations within a community governance framework. This means that they are involved in an arena of public decision making about local resources that extends beyond local state services to embrace those activities that involve either the provision of public services as part of the community, or the representation of community interests to the broader policy community. The two agencies used in this study are Brophy Family and Youth Services in Warrnambool, Australia, that services southwest Victoria and Aberdeen Foyer in the regional city of Aberdeen, Scotland that services the rural hinterland. While these agencies are pursuing the same path towards a community governance approach they have adopted different strategies to achieve their aims. Using these two agencies as exemplars this paper outlines a conceptual model that helps to provide an understanding of an emerging community governance framework in the welfare sector.",

Youth were classified on their adaptation according to 2 concepts, Connectedness and Risks. Connectedness refers to engagement with the adult world through work, schooling, marriage, and parenthood. Risks refer to problems with substance abuse, financial difficulties, and mental health problems that would hinder engagement with the adult world. All of the youth maintained at least one adult connection, but only 6 youth did not have a risk at the final interview. Three years after discharge 50% of the respondents had a drug and/or alcohol problem, and had neither savings nor health insurance. Despite many problems the post foster care period was marked by much resilience as most struggled to remain independent, and continue their schooling. Factors which facilitated successful adaptations were: a period of transitional residence after foster care, good support systems including family and former social workers, and a commitment to further education.",

It is well established that foster care review was designed with the intent to reduce the time children spend in foster care and increase permanent placements for children. This article presents that foster care review, as practiced in Colorado, is a social work intervention and quantitative results of this study demonstrate that as an intervention, timely administrative case review is an effective social work intervention related to improving child welfare outcomes for the children and families served in Colorado. The major findings show that timely administrative case review and increased levels of review attendance (mother, father, Guardian ad litems, and foster parents) are predictors of the child welfare outcomes of permanency and length of time in out-of-home care. Bivariate results indicate a median length of stay approximately 10.76 months longer for children who do not consistently receive timely case reviews. Additionally, the results show that timely care review moderates the underlying casework process related to caseworker contacts, demonstrating that a childs length of stay differs depending on the level of timely case review. In essence, the administrative case review process in Colorado is effectively achieving its goal and is an effective intervention for improving the lives of children in foster care.",

Growth mixture modeling was applied, and five distinct employment trajectory groups were identified for both men and women. The identified patterns were largely similar for men and women except that a U-shape employment trajectory was uniquely identified for women. Early-initiation drug users, users of “hard” drugs, and frequent drug users were more likely to demonstrate consistently low levels of employment, and the negative relationship between drug use and employment was more apparent among men than women. Also, positive associations between employment and marriage became more salient for men over time, as did negative associations between employment and childrearing among women. Processes are dynamic and complex, suggesting that throughout the life course, protective factors that reduce the risk of employment problems emerge and change, as do critical periods for maximizing the impact of drug prevention and intervention efforts.",

Methods The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) included women aged 50-79 years at enrollment (1993-1998). In the WHI Extension Study (2005-2010), participants annually reported any NH admission in the preceding year. Separate multivariate logistic regression models analyzed social and economic factors associated with long-term NH admission, defined as an admission on 2 or more questionnaires, overall and poststroke. Results Of 103,237 participants, 8904 (8.6%) reported NH admission (2005-2010); 534 of 2225 (24.0%) women with incident stroke reported poststroke NH admission. Decreased likelihoods of NH admission overall were demonstrated for Asian, Black, and Hispanic women (versus whites, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = .35-.44, P < .001) and women with higher income (aOR = .75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .63-.90), whereas increased likelihoods of NH admission overall were seen for women with lower social support (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.16-1.54) and with incident stroke (aOR = 2.59, 95% CI = 2.15-3.12). Increased odds of NH admission after stroke were demonstrated for women with moderate disability after stroke (aOR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.73-4.42). Further adjustment for stroke severity eliminated the association found for race/ethnicity, income, and social support. Conclusions The level of care needed after a disabling stroke may overwhelm social and economic structures in place that might otherwise enable avoidance of NH admission. We need to identify ways to provide care consistent with patients preferences, even after a disabling stroke.",

Future research should take explicit account of substitute care contexts in designing and carrying out studies examining the adult outcomes of aging out foster care populations.

		"abstract": "Objectives Knowledge about self-rated disability over time in psychotic disorders is limited. How self-rated disability relates to clinician-rated global functioning, self-rated life satisfaction and symptomatology was investigated across the first year of treatment in early psychosis. Methods Participants with first treated episode of psychosis (n = 115) were investigated at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Self-rated Disability was measured with World Health Organization- Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Clinician-rated global functioning, self-rated life satisfaction, and symptomatology were measured with appropriate scales. Results Average self-rated disability in first-treated episode of psychosis was high, corresponding with the 10% highest in a general population sample. However, 37% were not disabled at a clinically significant level after one year. Self-rated disability was highest in the two social domains (Getting along with people and Participation in society), but improved significantly from baseline to 1-year. At 1-year follow-up self-rated disability had significant weak to medium correlations with clinician-rated global functioning and positive symptoms, and mainly medium to strong correlations with life satisfaction and depressive symptoms. Yet only baseline depression significantly predicted disability after one year. Conclusion Self-rated disability in first treated episode of psychosis is high, but improves across the first year, indicating signs of early recovery. Moreover, self-rated disability is related, but distinct from clinician-rated global functioning and self-rated life satisfaction, suggesting that self-rated disability should also be assessed in order to more fully describe outcomes in first episode psychosis. The findings highlight the need for specialised treatment of depression and social disability in early psychosis.",

Objective To identify personal and environmental predictors of the most disrupted participation domains in people with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Outpatient neuromuscular clinic. Participants Adults (n=200; 121 women), age 18 years or older (mean age, 47y), with a confirmed diagnosis of DM1 were selected from the registry of a neuromuscular clinic (N=416). Fifty-two participants had the mild phenotype and 148 the adult phenotype. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Social participation in mobility, housing, employment, and recreation was assessed with the Life Habits Measure. Disrupted participation was based on whether help was needed in performing most life habits because of incapacities or environmental barriers. Environmental factors were assessed by using the Measure of the Quality of the Environment. Personal factors were assessed with standardized instruments including the Berg Balance Scale, the Krupp Fatigue Severity Scale, and manual muscle testing. Results A large proportion of participants (45%–61%) reported disrupted participation in all 4 domains. Lower-extremity strength (odd ratios [OR], 15.0–5.5; P<.050) and higher fatigue (OR, 6.0–2.6; P<.05) were present in participants with disrupted participation. With regard to environmental factors, family support (OR, 3.6–2.5; P<.05) and public services (OR, 2.8–2.2; P<.05) were perceived as barriers for participants with disrupted participation in most domains. Conclusions This study identified personal and environmental factors that may influence the trajectory toward disrupted participation in individuals with DM1. Fatigue, strength, family support, and public services were found to be independent predictors of disrupted participation.",

Medicaid is the primary public funder of health care services for individuals with ASD. One mechanism state Medicaid agencies can use to craft ASD-specific services is a 1915(c) waiver. Objective This study investigated what state policy makers perceived to be primary success factors and barriers to adopting an ASD specific 1915(c) waiver, as well as what services and supports are available in each state for children and transition-age youth with ASD. Methods Data were collected by contacting state Medicaid directors via email with an electronic survey, with an 84% response rate. Results Support from state legislators and parents and family members were the primary success factors in adopting an ASD specific waiver. The primary barrier was insufficient funding. States not adopting an ASD specific waiver also perceived that children and youth with ASD were served sufficiently well through other Medicaid benefits. Analysis of specific services indicated that the majority of states provide their services to children and transition age youth with ASD through a 1915(c) waiver for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, often coupled with an ASD specific waiver for children, another 1915(c) waiver for children, and/or a another 1915(c) waiver, most often for children with serious emotional disturbance. Conclusion Further research is needed to determine which approach(es) is most effective in enhancing access and improving outcomes for children and youth with ASD.",

		"abstract": "While economic evaluations typically embrace health maximization as the maximization objective using quality-adjusted life years, there is increasing interest in the measurement of capability wellbeing and subjective wellbeing (SWB) for informing policy decisions. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between health-related quality of life (HRQoL), capability wellbeing and SWB. Data were used from 364 individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI) who previously completed a web-based, cross-sectional survey (March–June 2013). Regression analyses were used to study the impacts of secondary health conditions on HRQoL, capability wellbeing and SWB; subsequently, a path analysis was used to assess direct and mediated pathways. HRQoL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L and the Assessment of Quality of Life 8-dimension (AQoL-8D) questionnaire; capability wellbeing was assessed using the ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A), and SWB was based on a single life satisfaction item (0–10 rating scale). Mean scores were 0.492, 0.573, 0.761 and 6.319 for EQ-5D-5L, AQoL-8D, ICECAP-A and SWB, respectively. Beta coefficients from the regression analyses indicated that secondary health conditions had the greatest negative impact on individuals HRQoL (βAQoL-8D = −0.668, βEQ-5D-5L = −0.542), followed by SWB (βSWB = −0.481) and capability wellbeing (βICECAP-A = −0.477). Capability wellbeing mediated the effect of secondary health conditions on HRQoL and SWB. The indirect effect of secondary health conditions on SWB through HRQoL was not statistically significant when using EQ-5D-5L; indirect effects were found when using AQoL-8D, one through HRQoL only and one through both capability wellbeing and HRQoL. This study highlights the different impacts of secondary health conditions on HRQoL, capability and SWB in the context of SCI. While the greatest impact was observed on individuals HRQoL, our results provide further evidence that capability wellbeing (here, the ICECAP-A) adds complementary information about outcomes that could be used in economic evaluation.",

		"abstract": "People with schizophrenia demonstrate both impairment in mental time travel and reduced expectancies of performance on future tasks. We aimed to reconcile these findings within the Kahneman and Tversky (1982) simulation heuristic framework by testing a key prediction that impaired future simulation would be associated with reduced performance expectancies in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SZSPEC). A total of 54 individuals (30 people with SZSPEC and 24 healthy controls) generated mental simulations of everyday scenarios; after each response they rated performance expectations, distress and the similarity of the scenario to experience. Independent raters coded the coherence of responses. We found that people with SZSPEC had, compared to healthy controls, lower performance expectations and greater anticipated distress when imaging everyday scenarios. Lower performance expectancies were associated with lower experience of similar scenarios, greater negative symptoms and social withdrawal in the SZSPEC group. The current study confirmed previous findings of both impaired mental simulation and abnormal performance expectations in people with SZSPEC, together with the association of the latter with negative symptoms. Experience with social or occupational activities plays a more important role in determining performance expectancies in people with SS than the ability to mentally simulate scenarios.",

Design Instrument development included an extensive literature review, item classification and selection, item writing, and cognitive testing following the approach of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Setting Community. Participants Content area and outcome measurement experts (n=10) contributed to instrument development; individuals (n=200) with the target conditions participated in focus groups and in cognitive testing (n=15). Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures Environmental factor items were categorized in 6 domains: assistive technology; built and natural environment; social environment; services, systems, and policies; access to information and technology; and economic quality of life. Results We binned 2273 items across the 6 domains, winnowed this pool to 291 items for cognitive testing, and recommended 274 items for pilot data collection. Conclusions Five of the 6 domains correspond closely to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health taxonomy of environmental factors; the sixth domain, economic quality of life, reflects an important construct that reflects financial resources that affect participation. Testing with a new and larger sample is underway to evaluate reliability, validity, and sensitivity.",

		"abstract": "Challenging an implicit assumption of universal applicability, we propose that a subset of transformational leader behaviors may hamper organizational outcomes for a unique yet growing segment of the workforce: employees on the autism spectrum. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that emotion-laden communication and social exchanges characterizing the inspirational motivation dimension of the theory are associated with increased feelings of anxiety which, in turn, negatively relate to work outcomes. In contrast, we proposed that other dimensions of transformational leadership, such as individualized consideration, would be associated with reduced levels of anxiety and, ultimately, improved workplace outcomes. Results generally supported the hypothesized indirect relationships for ratings of organizational commitment, but not self-reported job performance which was most strongly predicted by individualized consideration, directly. Implications for managing employees with autism spectrum disorder are discussed as well as the overall applicability of transformational leadership to this growing segment of the workforce.",

		"abstract": "Case management has been the preferred method of helping persons with mental illness live in the community. This report examines the historical development of case management practice over the past 30 years. The analysis revealed that evolutionary growth in case management developed in response to expansion of community mental health services rather than consumer interests to improve their quality of life. Consequently, this reveals itself in the lack of outcome criteria needed to measure case management effectiveness. Currently, the concept of case management is undergoing a revolutionary paradigm shift that is “consumer-driven” and responds to consumer concerns. However, as mental health care costs rise within a rapidly growing community mental health care system, managed care is being implemented as a method to contain these rising costs. Because of major differences in philosophical underpinnings, developments in support of public mental health managed care may jeopardize the genesis of consumer-driven case management by supporting case management models that reflect managed care ideology.",

		"abstract": "Existing measures for functional assessment do not adequately address the relationship between cognitive impairment and function. The Schizophrenia Outcomes Functioning Interview (SOFI) was developed to measure community functioning related to cognitive impairment and psychopathology. Following review of existing measures and discussion with experts, caregivers, and patients, content was generated for four domains: 1) living situation; 2) IADLs; 3) productive activities; and 4) social functioning. The final SOFI was constructed with items informing domain scores, and an interviewer-completed global rating for each domain. Psychometric characteristics of the SOFI were evaluated in a sample of 104 community residing patients with schizophrenia and their informants. Test–retest reliability was evaluated in a sub-sample of patient–informant dyads using ICC; all values were >0.70 for both patient-interviews (SOFI-P) and informant-interviews (SOFI-I). Inter-rater reliability ICCs ranged from 0.50 to 0.79 on a different sub-sample. The SOFI demonstrated adequate construct validity based on correlations with the PSP (range 0.58 to 0.76; p < 0.0001) and the QLS (p < 0.001). Some correlations between SOFI and PETiT scores were low to moderate (p < 0.05). Discriminant validity was supported based on SOFI score comparisons for patient groups based on PANSS and BACS scores (p < 0.05); SOFI scores differed between borderline and moderately ill patients as measured by the CGI-S (p < 0.05). The SOFI expands on existing measures and more comprehensively captures functioning of patients in the real world than other performance-based (proxy) measures. The SOFI has good evidence supporting reliability and construct validity, and may be a useful measure of functional outcomes in schizophrenia.",

		"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.08.028",
		"abstract": "Research in a number of countries has demonstrated the importance of developing a sense of belonging and connectedness as key factors that facilitate the move towards independence for young people leaving care (see Stein, 2008). This paper utilises findings from a longitudinal study of looked after children (including interviews with care leavers) to explore how the evidence from Canadian research into the significance of perceptions of self continuity for identity formation can improve our understanding of care leavers experiences and the factors that may act as barriers to their making a smooth transition. The findings demonstrate the extent of disruption and instability that care leavers may experience both before, during and after the care episode. This lack of continuity is exemplified for many young people by the loss of treasured possessions such as mementoes of parents and photographs of previous homes and carers. Constant experience of transience may act as a barrier to the establishment of a sense of self continuity. This may increase the likelihood of leaving care becoming a transitional flashpoint during which difficulties in moving on to adulthood increase the propensity for young people to lose sight of the thread that connects their past to their future, and engage in self-destructive behaviours. Premature, compressed and accelerated transitions may increase the chances of this happening. The paper argues that greater attention to the preservation of possessions that have a symbolic value might be a simple means of helping care leavers develop a stronger sense of connectedness.",

		"abstract": "This article on service responses to women of African, African-Caribbean, Irish, Jewish and South Asian backgrounds facing domestic violence draws on our recently completed study based in Manchester, UK (Batsleer et al., 2002) [Batsteeler, J., Burman, E., Chantler, K., McIntosh, S.H., Pantling, K., Smailes, S., Warner, S., et al. 2002. Domestic violence minoritisation: Supporting women to indepence. Womens Studies Centre: The Manchester Metropolitan University]. We frame our analysis of domestic violence and minoritisation around the question that is frequently posed in relation to women living with domestic violence: ‘why doesn’t she leave?’ In response, we highlight the complex and intersecting connections between domestic violence, law, mental health provision, entitlement to welfare services, which function alongside constructions of ‘culture’ and cultural identifications, structures of racism, class and gendered oppression. All these contribute to maintain women, particularly minoritized women, in violent relationships. Further, we illustrate how leaving violent relationships does not necessarily guarantee the safety of women and children escaping domestic violence. Despite many recent legal and social policy initiatives in the UK that have usefully brought domestic violence into the public domain, there have also been counter-measures which have made leaving violent relationships correspondingly more difficult, in particular for women from minoritized communities. We offer an analysis of how state practices, particularly facets of immigration law in the UK (although Bhattacharjee, 1997, provides an equivalent U.S. analysis), interact with domestic violence. These not only equip perpetrators with a powerful tool to oppress minoritized women further, but it also indicates how state structures thereby come to impact directly on women’s distress (Chantler et al, 2001). In addition, we highlight how other aspects of state policy and practice which enter into the material well-being of survivors of domestic violence, for example, housing, levels of state benefits, and child-care also pose significant obstacles to minoritized women leaving violent relationships. Whilst women from majority/dominant groups also face many of these barriers, we illustrate how the racialized dimensions of such policies heightens their exclusionary effects. It is argued that legal and psychological strategies need to address the complexity of how public, state and institutional practices intersect with racism, class and gender oppression in order to develop more sensitive and accessible ways of supporting minoritized women and children living with domestic violence.",

		"abstract": "This paper utilizes the 2009 and 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) to examine spatial patterns of older adult in-migration. This focus area is timely given the Baby Boom generation entering retirement and the emergence of North Carolina as a select destination for older adults (see Vincent & Velkoff, 2010; and He & Schachter, 2003). Results from this paper reveal interesting trends, which can help shape policy relating to aging, health services, housing, and transportation. For example, the 65 and older population in North Carolina has increased from 10 to over 13 percent during the past, few decades (see Census Historical Decennial Reports, U.S. Census, 2002; and NC Office of State Budget and Management, 2010). If this trend holds, North Carolina may become demographically similar to Florida. More specifically, areas outside Asheville, Charlotte, and Greeneville have experienced large inflows and may become prime retirement communities. As Wilmoth (2010) succinctly states, “geographic areas that receive these types of older migrants [i.e., comfort] should expect more demand on programs and services that promote engaged, active lifestyles” (page 878).",

The purpose is to describe the role of facades in the process of suffering and acceptance. Clients took photographs, talked about them in group meetings, and exhibited them to a broader audience. Their photo stories were analyzed using a mixed-methods model. Data from two narrative approaches (semiotics and hermeneutics) were compared with information from other informants and official records to find discrepancies between the photo story and the real life context. Although facades are usually perceived as an obstacle for personal growth, the visual narratives revealed that facades can function as an alternative to common acceptance strategies, such as facing ones losses and reconciliation. Facades can create a distance between the person and the suffering. We conclude that visual narratives can reveal and foster agency in clients.",

Design Descriptive correlational study. Ratings were made by 2 treating clinicians on patients at discharge and 1 week later by using Forms A and B of the SPRS. A subset of 25 close relatives of the patients also completed the 2 SPRS forms and the London Handicap Scale at patient discharge. Setting Inpatient brain injury rehabilitation unit. Participants Sixty-six people with brain injury. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measure The SPRS is a 12-item questionnaire, rated on a 7-point scale, that measures function in occupational, interpersonal, and living skills domains. Results The internal consistency of Form B was high (α=.90), as was stability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=.90) and interrater agreement (ICC=.84). Similarly, good psychometric properties were found for Form A for internal consistency (α=.90), stability (ICC=.90) and interrater agreement (ICC=.82), which replicated previous findings with this form. Comparability between forms was excellent (ICC=.97), and correspondence between ratings of the clinician and close relatives on Forms A and B was fair to good (ICC=.57, ICC=.67, respectively). Conclusions Form B of the SPRS has psychometric properties equally sound to those of Form A.

		"abstract": "mHealth under the umbrella of eHealth has become an essential tool for providing quality, accessible and equal health care services at an affordable cost. Despite the potential benefits of mHealth, its adoption remains a big challenge in developing countries such as Bangladesh. This study aims to examine the factors affecting the adoption of mHealth services in Bangladesh by using the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model with perceived reliability and price value factors. It also examines the moderating effect of gender on the intention to use and on the actual usage behavior of users of mHealth services. A well-structured face-to-face survey was employed to collect the data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with a partial least squares method was used to analyze the data collected from 296 generation Y participants. The results confirmed that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and perceived reliability positively influence the behavioral intention to adopt mHealth services. However, effort expectancy and price value did not have a significance influence on the behavioral intention. Moreover, Gender has a significant moderating effect on mHealth services adoption in certain cases. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of this study are also discussed.",

The paper also discusses potential determinants of physical independence and dependence, including different domains of disability, the role of subjective perceptions, demographics, the physical and social/political environments, personal resources, attitudes and coping resources, illness and efficacy appraisals, and the nature of the assistive relationship. The paper extends work on physical independence and dependence by synthesizing the findings from previous studies and incorporating the findings from other relevant areas of research into the area. It also expands on the concepts of physical independence and dependence, as well as their determinants, and relates independence and dependence to other outcomes of interest such as service delivery.",

		"abstract": "Background Although cognitive deficits have consistently been characterized as core features of schizophrenia, they have not been incorporated into definitions of remission. Furthermore, just a few studies have examined the relationship between cognitive deficits and symptomatic remission. The main aim of the present study is to evaluate the executive functioning of nonremitted schizophrenia patients. Methods 72 remitted and 42 nonremitted schizophrenia patients, and 119 healthy controls were examined. Subjects were tested with a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests, including a measure to assess the general components of executive functioning and individual tasks to tap the three specific executive dimensions assessed in the present study, namely updating, shifting and inhibition. Results Schizophrenia subjects performed poorly on general executive functioning and shifting tasks in comparison to healthy controls. Remitted subjects performed better than nonremitted on inhibition and updating tasks. Whereas being a male and showing decreases in updating increase the chances of being in the nonremitted schizophrenia subjects group, increases in shifting and updating enhance the odds of being in the healthy control group. Conclusion The present findings suggest that executive function deficits are present in chronic schizophrenic patients. In addition, specific executive processes might be associated to symptom remission. Future studies examining prospectively first-episode, drug naive patients diagnosed with schizophrenia may be especially elucidative.",

Case-based analysis of transcripts of in-depth ethnographic interviews with rural elders in the southeastern US is used to develop a model of nutritional self-management, defined as the behavioral regimen that older persons use to obtain food, prepare food and maintain food security. Behaviors used to accomplish these nutritional self-management tasks can be drawn from four domains (self-care, informal support, formal support and medical care) and the strategy s adequacy can be evaluated by measures of nutritional status. Research applications of the model, as well as its link to the concept of adaptation are discussed.",

With only few exceptions, the ‘post asylum geographies’ of intellectually disabled people remain neglected by geographers. We advocate a redressing of this imbalance. First, we assess reasons for the relative absence of ‘intellectual’ considerations in geographies of disability. We then consider ways in which the full spectrum of those with mental differences might be included in geographical research. We conclude that Wolperts call 25 years ago to ‘open closed spaces’ is just as applicable to our efforts to conceptually link health, place, and disability, as it is to the material welfare of vulnerable groups in society.",

		"abstract": "Many rural communities in the United States are experiencing significant population aging, and these changes in age structure are often associated with shifts in economic activity. The demands for certain goods and services are expected to vary across age groups, and public- and private-sector service providers may make decisions based on their interpretation of demographic trends. The extent to which these perceived changes in the demand for services align with their provision has significant implications for the well-being of the older residents of aging communities. In this article, we draw on case studies of four aging communities across the rural United States to examine the provision of, and access to, aging-related services. We analyze how service provision is organized both within and between communities, how this organization is associated with the kinds of services available, the ways that older residents gain access to services, and the set of barriers to access they face. Our research suggests that aging-related service provision in rural communities is facilitated by partnerships among local community institutions and between them and external organizations. While in many cases population aging is associated with economic decline, the impact of demographic change is not mechanistic nor automatic. Our research shows that aging rural communities can be resilient, and that cooperative, multi-scalar relationships are a key to maintaining quality of life among older residents of communities with aging populations.",

In this article we examine the key factors that facilitate physical activity in highly active community-dwelling older adults. Using a strengths based approach, we examined the factors that facilitated physical activity in our sample of highly active older adults. Twenty-seven older adults participated in face-to face interviews. We extracted a sub-sample of 10 highly active older adults to be included in the analyses. Based on a framework analysis of our transcripts we identified three factors that facilitate physical activity in our sample, these include: 1) resourcefulness: engagement in self-help strategies such as self-efficacy, self-control and adaptability; 2) social connections: the presence of relationships (friend, neighborhood, institutions) and social activities that support or facilitate high levels of physical activity; and 3) the role of the built and natural environments: features of places and spaces that support and facilitate high levels of physical activity. Findings provide insight into, and factors that facilitate older adults physical activity. We discuss implications for programs (e.g., accessible community centers, with appropriate programming throughout the lifecourse) and policies geared towards the promotion of physical activity (e.g., the development of spaces that facilitate both physical and social activities).",

Objective/hypothesis To describe the development of the Waisman Activities of Daily Living (W-ADL) Scale for adolescents and adults with developmental disabilities, and systematically evaluate its measurement properties according to an established set of criteria. Methods The W-ADL was administered among four longitudinally studied groups of adolescents and adults with developmental disabilities: 406 with autism; 147 with fragile-X syndrome; 169 with Down syndrome; and 292 with intellectual disability of other or unknown origin. The W-ADL contains 17 activities and each is rated on a 3-point scale (0 = “does not do at all”, 1 = “does with help”, 2 = “independent”), and a standard set of criteria were used to evaluate its measurement properties. Results Across the disability groups, Cronbachs alphas ranged from 0.88 to 0.94, and a single-factor structure was most parsimonious. The W-ADL was reliable over time, with weighted kappas between 0.92 and 0.93. Criterion and construct validity were supported through substantial associations with the Vineland Screener, need for respite services, caregiving burden, and competitive employment. No floor or ceiling effects were present. There were significant group differences in W-ADL scores by maternally reported level of intellectual disability (mild, moderate, severe, profound). Conclusions The W-ADL exceeded the recommended threshold for each quality criterion the authors evaluated.

The detailed assessments at follow-up in the early years provide us with valuable information on the performance of the children at a given point in time. With increasing age of the subjects, the investigation into their outcome has evolved from a narrow focus of neurodevelopmental status to broader considerations of their overall morbidity, accomplishments and self-perception of their health and quality of life. In this chapter, we will reflect on the importance of the detailed measures in the early years, the impact of moderating background variables on predictability of outcomes, implications for the future and what really matters at young adulthood for infants born prematurely. We will explore the perspectives of different respondents and the need to look beyond the traditional measures to obtain complementary information.",

Existing measures lack content validity relating to these three environments. The aim of this study was to contribute to the content validity phase of developing a new scale for assessing mobility of people with stroke in these settings. An open–ended questionnaire was used to obtain responses from 15 physiotherapists with substantial experience in neurological physiotherapy. Responses were coded to provide a comprehensive list of tasks and destinations. A wide range of destinations was identified for i) inside the home: bedroom, bathroom/toilet, living room, kitchen; ii) outside the home: access to and from property, outside buildings, clothesline, garden and letterbox; and iii) in the community: access to health and shopping facilities, leisure sites and public transport. Although a diverse range of tasks was identified, a common theme emerged to emphasise the impact of the environment on mobility. Responses were recorded in all dimensions of a recently published conceptual model of mobility that focused on environment. These dimensions included distance, time constraints, ambient conditions, terrain characteristics, external physical load, attentional demands, postural transitions and traffic level. Further work is required to quantify environmental dimensions which are relevant to the destinations identified in the three environmental settings of this study.",

The natural tendency is to focus on individual comorbidities as isolated entities, such as a history of coronary heart disease, while ignoring factors more specific to the aging process itself.

		"abstract": "Despite 50years of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, schizophrenia remains one of the leading causes of disability. Schizophrenia is also a life-shortening illness, caused mainly by poor physical health and its complications. The end result is a considerably reduced lifespan that is marred by reduced levels of independence, with few novel treatment options available. Disability is a multidimensional construct that results from different, and often interacting, factors associated with specific types and levels of impairment. In schizophrenia, the most poignant and well characterized determinants of disability are symptoms, cognitive and related skills deficits, but there is limited understanding of other relevant factors that contribute to disability. Here we conceptualize how reduced physical performance interacts with aging, neurobiological, treatment-emergent, and cognitive and skills deficits to exacerbate ADL disability and worsen physical health. We argue that clearly defined physical performance components represent underappreciated variables that, as in mentally healthy people, offer accessible targets for exercise interventions to improve ADLs in schizophrenia, alone or in combination with improvements in cognition and health. And, finally, due to the accelerated aging pattern inherent in this disease – lifespans are reduced by 25years on average – we present a training model based on proven training interventions successfully used in older persons. This model is designed to target the physical and psychological declines associated with decreased independence, coupled with the cardiovascular risk factors and components of the metabolic syndrome seen in schizophrenia due to their excess prevalence of obesity and low fitness levels.",

		"abstract": "Introduction Facial affect recognition deficits may represent specific deficits and contribute to social dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. Whether their impacts on social dysfunction are independent to those caused by deficits in basic neurocognition and clinical symptoms needs to be further delineated. Method Association patterns between affect recognition and basic neurocognitive abilities in 40 acute and 33 stable patients with schizophrenia were compared to explore whether their interrelationships changed across clinical stages. The independent contribution of affect recognition deficits to social dysfunction was explored by multivariate models controlling for general intellectual ability, basic neurocognition, and clinical symptoms. Results Affect recognition deficits were associated with social role performances, self-care, and contributed independently to global social functioning in stable patients but not in acute patients. Conversely, affect recognition deficits were associated with impaired basic neurocognitions in acute patients but not in stable patients. Conclusion In stabilized community patients with schizophrenia, affect recognition deficits were relatively independent to basic neurocognition and had significant social functional consequences.",

		"abstract": "While we know that minority status differentiates the experience of aging, little research has been done to examine the ways in which patterns of successful aging may differ in diverse subgroups of older adults. In this exploratory study, we investigated and described experiences of successful aging in a sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) older adults. Directed by a community-based participatory research process, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 22 LGBT adults, age 60 and older. We took an inductive, grounded theory approach to analyze the taped and transcribed interviews. We coded respondent experiences in four domains: physical health, mental health, emotional state and social engagement. Four gradations of successful aging emerged. Very few in our sample met the bar for “traditional success” characterized by the absence of problems in all four domains of health. Most of the sample was coping to a degree with problems and was categorized in one of two gradations on a continuum of successful aging: “surviving and thriving” and “working at it.” A small number was “ailing”: not coping well with problems. Some of the experiences that respondents described were related to LGBT status; others were related to more general processes of aging. The research suggests that a successful aging framework that is modified to include coping can better describe the experiences of LGBT older adults. The modified conceptual model outlined here may be useful in future research on this population, as well as more broadly for diverse populations of adults, and may be adapted for use in practice to assess and improve health and well-being.",

		"abstract": "The goal of all long-term care arrangements is to reduce the disabling effects of physical impairments and functional limitations. However, the means with which individuals cope with disability may not be equivalent and these differences may influence self-reports of disability in surveys. This paper examines assistive devices and personal care as factors in the measurement of disability among persons aged 70 and older in the community using the 1994 Survey of Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) in the US. The use of assistive technology differs from personal care on a fundamental level. It does not require the ongoing cooperation or coordination of other people and therefore increases the sense of independence with which a disabled individual can meet their long-term care needs. Results indicate that older individuals can expect to spend most of their remaining years in good functional health, but up to two-thirds of disabled years will be spent with unmet ADL needs. Among those who are disabled, those who use only equipment and no personal care report less residual difficulty with mobility than those who use personal assistance (either alone or in combination with equipment) but the use of equipment alone is most effective for those with the least severe limitations.",

Objective To determine which variables influence the receipt of physical rehabilitation services (ie, physical, occupational, speech therapy) for a population of people with chronic and disabling conditions. Design A convenience sample of 502 adults with cerebral palsy (CP), multiple sclerosis (MS), and spinal cord injury (SCI), drawn from diverse parts of the United States. Setting Respondents were surveyed in the general community. Participants Persons (91% under the age of 65y) with CP, MS, or SCI who responded to the 1999 component of a national longitudinal survey. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported need for physical rehabilitation services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine variables that influenced utilization of services. Results Some 53% of respondents did not receive self-reported needed physical rehabilitation services. Respondents who had Medicaid were more likely than those with Medicare or private insurance to receive physical rehabilitation services. Respondents having a lower household income and poorer health were less likely to receive services. Conclusions Our findings indicate that health care funding sources provide widely disparate coverage for physical rehabilitation services to persons with 3 specific chronic and disabling conditions. Policy-makers and health plan administrators should re-evaluate their coverage of physical rehabilitation services designed to enhance quality of life and reduce the burden of lost independence.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction This is a report of a population-based cross-sectional observational study in Western Australia (WA) on male erectile dysfunction (ED). Aim To assess the prevalence of ED in WA and to examine its associated sociodemographic factors. Method Postal questionnaires were sent to randomly selected age-stratified male population samples obtained from the WA Electoral Roll. Main Outcome Measures In addition to items covering sociodemographic and clinical information, the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO), the Socioeconomic Index for Area (SEIFA), and the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) were used. Results One thousand seven hundred seventy (41.9%) of 4,228 questionnaires were returned. One thousand five hundred eighty (89.3%) were completed questionnaires from men aged 20.1 to 99.6 years (mean 57.9, median 59.1, standard deviation 18.5). The prevalences of any ED and of severe ED among adult males in WA, adjusted for age distribution, were 25.1 and 8.5%, respectively. Standardized to World Health Organization (WHO) World Standard Population, the corresponding prevalences were 23.4 and 7.4%. Prevalence, as well as severity, of ED increased with age. Thirty-eight percent of the participants who were married or had partners experienced ED (severe ED 19.1%). The prevalence of ED was not significantly different between “white-collar” and “blue-collar” workers. Despite the great majority of the affected participants having experienced ED for >1 year, only 14.1% reported having ever received any treatment for ED. Conclusions The study has provided population-based epidemiological data on ED in Western Australian men covering a wide range of ages. The finding that ED is age related, highly prevalent, and grossly underdiagnosed and undertreated is pertinent to global population aging and a rapidly aging Australian population. To facilitate comparisons across populations with different age distributions, all future population-based studies on ED should be standardized to WHO World Standard Population.

Semi-structured interviews with participants and participant-generated video diaries revealed that these men were materially, socially and symbolically marginalized through inaccessible built environments, social arrangements that limited their engagement in community life, and the multiple ways that their bodies were negatively marked across social space. Furthermore their marginalization had been embodied through processes of socialization and internalization of subordinate social positionings. While the men created positive personal spaces for recognition and success, their achievements were severely circumscribed by significant social inequities.",

Individuals live independently in their own apartments and use supportive mental health services as needed. The study conceptualizes ones housing environment as existing at the apartment, neighborhood and the surrounding community levels of analysis that, taken together, form a multi-dimensional construct of housing environment. Self-report data from interviews with a sample of seriously mentally ill adults is paired with (a) observer ratings of housing environments, (b) census profiles of the surrounding community and (c) case manager ratings of clients’ functioning in order to explore the effects of supported housing environments on well-being outcomes. Well-being is operationalized here as levels of psychiatric distress, recovery orientation, residential satisfaction, and adaptive functioning. Hierarchical regression models posit that apartment, neighborhood and census tract level variables are unique predictors of these domains of well-being. Results show that neighborhood level variables, especially those relating to the social environment, are the most influential predictors for understanding variance in well-being, with apartment level variables also contributing to understanding of housing environment effects. The census tract level predictors did not contribute a significant amount of explanation of the variance in well-being outcomes. Implications for supported housing programs and the role of ecological levels of analysis in conceptualizing and measuring housing environment influence are discussed.",

A fourth group of individuals with fractures without any support was used as a reference group. Fractures included were humeral, wrist, vertebral, hip, pelvic and ankle fractures. Questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic data and information on social participation, social support, and covariates. The results showed that a smaller proportion of those with only formal support took part in social, cultural, or leisure activities, compared to participants with informal support alone, both informal and formal support or those without any kind of support. The associations between categories of activity and kind of support were further tested in a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders. Odds ratios (ORs) for taking part in social, cultural, and leisure activities were significantly lower for participants with formal support and a combination of informal and formal support, while participants receiving informal support did not show a significantly reduced OR for taking part in any category of activity, compared to the reference group. In conclusion; informal support of older people with fractures is an important means of facilitating social participation and an active lifestyle. Attention should be paid to the vulnerable situation of those who rely solely on formal support.",

Switching and theory of mind predicted prospective memory performance in adolescents.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this scoping review is to explore previous scientific studies relating to the scholarly understanding of societal participation of people with disabilities. Six relevant databases within social science were searched using societal participation of people with disabilities, or different combinations thereof, as search words. The criteria for inclusion were: working-age people with disabilities; societal participation; accounting for facilitators or/and barriers of participation; geographical focus on or link to Europe, peer-reviewed studies using quantitative or qualitative methods published in English between January 2012 and December 2013. Thirty-two studies met these inclusion criteria. Each study was analysed relating to four measures: identity of the participator group, type of participation; type of facilitators; type of barriers. The findings show that there is a dominating focus on labour market participation and that societal participation was studied mostly concerning disabled people in general instead of any specific group. The main barriers identified were related to financial factors, attitudes, health issues and unemployment. The most frequently identified facilitators were related to legislation and disability policies, as well as to support from people in close contact with disabled people, attitudes in society and employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Résumé Cette analyse a pour objet d’explorer des études scientifiques récentes afin d’aboutir à une synthèse des conceptions académiques sur la participation dans la société des personnes qui présentent une incapacité. Nous avons exploré six bases de données pertinentes relevant du domaine des sciences sociales en utilisant comme termes de recherche « societal participation of people with disabilities/participation dans la société des personnes handicapées » sous différentes combinaisons. Les critères d’inclusion étaient les suivants : personnes handicapées en âge de travailler, participation dans la société, obstacles et/ou facilitateurs à la participation ; zone limitée géographiquement à l’Europe ou liée à l’Europe, études quantitatives ou qualitatives évaluées par des pairs et publiées en anglais entre janvier 2012 et décembre 2013. Trente-deux recherches ont répondu à ces critères d’inclusion. Chacune de ces recherches a fait l’objet d’une analyse selon les 4 paramètres suivants : identité des participants du groupe, type de la participation, type du facilitateur et type de l’obstacle. Les résultats montrent que les études s’intéressent tout particulièrement à la participation sur le marché du travail et qu’elles portent principalement sur les personnes handicapées en général et non sur un groupe particulier. Les principaux obstacles identifiés concernent les aspects financiers, les attitudes, les problèmes liés à la santé et le chômage. Les facilitateurs les plus fréquemment identifiés relèvent de la législation et des politiques en faveur des personnes handicapées, du soutien de l’entourage, des attitudes dans la société et des possibilités d’emploi des personnes handicapées.",

Therefore, the transition to adulthood of young people leaving care is an important topic for research. However, there is still little knowledge about the different research approaches and research instruments that are being used in studying this topic. The aim of the present study is to review the approaches and instruments that are used in empirical studies that focus on young care leavers transitions to adulthood. The results show that the studies apply a diversity of topics and instruments, but that there is also considerable overlap. To make better comparisons on the transition from out-of-home care to adulthood between different countries, a common research framework and one or more research instruments should be developed that can assess this transition and the situation of young care leavers in diverse social contexts.",

At issue are the ways in which these two outcomes are affected by a series of eight client characteristics and service delivery features. The overarching question is the effectiveness of the program in establishing independence vocationally and residentially, and whether the same set of factors influences these two outcomes for persons with mental illness. Subjects were 212 ex-clients of a psychosocial rehabilitation agency who were working six months after leaving the program. The analysis derived two canonical functions both of which were significant. Canonical loadings and cross loadings indicated that client level of functioning and program tenure loaded most strongly with residential status on the first canonical variate while education loaded most strongly with salary on the second. These results support the notions that different predictors account for the variance associated with different outcomes following psychosocial rehabilitation. Discussion of the relevance of strong predictor variables highlights ways they can impact program design. Finally, the usefulness of canonical correlation in longitudinal program evaluation research is explored.",

		"abstract": "With the emergence of behaviour change on political and intellectual agendas in passenger transport, the question of how to understand and intervene in habitual carbon-intensive travel practices has become crucially important. Building primarily on the philosophies of Félix Ravaisson and John Dewey, we outline an approach to travel habits that is more affirmative than prevailing psychological perspectives. Rather than as the automatically cued, repetitive behaviour of individuals, habit is understood here as a generative and propulsive capacity brought about through repetition and belonging to body–mind–world assemblages that exceed the human individual as conventionally understood. The implications of the proposed conceptualisation of habits for behaviour change are also explored. We argue that widespread, durable behaviour change is unlikely to result from the displacement of automaticity by reasoned action alone but instead demands changes in collective customs. Additionally, a narrow focus on breaking carbon-intensive travel habits should be avoided. Not only should the formation of low-carbon habits and associated forms of embodied intelligence be stimulated; it is also important to capitalise on the potential for subtle change inherent to carbon-intensive travel habits in situations where individualised vehicular travel is the only realistic transport option.",

		"abstract": "Childhood adversity is a complex issue with the potential for lasting effects over the developmental trajectory. Research has confirmed that people who experience significant adversity, hardship and trauma in early stages of development are at an increased risk of a range of negative outcomes at later stages of the life-course, including increased psychological distress and dysfunction, decreased likelihood of educational engagement and an increased risk of early parenthood. However, distal events exert their influence on later outcomes through various proximal mechanisms. One such postulated mechanism is a sense of belonging. This study investigated the role of sense of belonging as a mediator between experiences of adversity in childhood and psychosocial outcomes in emerging adulthood, amongst a sample of 254 young people receiving a range of social services throughout Australia. Results of three mediation analyses confirm that the path from childhood adversity to psychological distress and educational engagement is only weakly mediated by sense of belonging. No other statistically significant relationships were found. These results indicate that additional mediators are likely needed to more fully explain the effects of childhood adversity on psychosocial functioning in emerging adulthood. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of belonging for practice in the field of child and youth welfare.",

		"abstract": "Background Stroke is the third leading cause of death in Hong Kong. As stroke is frequently followed by prolonged disability and functional dependence, a considerable number of stroke survivors require rehabilitation to reduce their degree of disability and handicap, and to enhance their chances of returning to functional independence at home. Objectives This study was undertaken to identify indicators that predict length of hospital stay (LOS), gain in Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and discharge placement after completion of a stroke rehabilitation programme in Hong Kong. Methods This was a retrospective study of 1,111 stroke patients who were admitted to Kowloon Hospital between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2002, and who were included in data analysis. Data were gathered on age, gender, marital status, pre- and post-hospital living setting, pre- and post-hospital living status, side of impairment, functional status in terms of admission and discharge FIM subtotal scores in self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. Outcome was measured by LOS, FIM gain, and discharge placement. Multiple linear regression was used to identify significant predictors of LOS and FIM gain after rehabilitation. A binary logistic regression was computed to identify significant predictors of discharge placement. Results Significant direct predictors of rehabilitation LOS were age, FIM gain, admission FIM subtotal scores for locomotion, transfer, communication, self-care and pre-hospital living in an institution. The mean gain in FIM score was 19.8 points (range, −10 to 69; SD, 12.5). Significant predictors of discharge placement were age, gender, marital status, pre-hospital living alone versus living with family, pre-hospital living in an institution versus living with family, admission FIM sub-total score in locomotion, self-care, and social cognition. Conclusions This study determined the predictors of discharge outcome for stroke rehabilitation in Hong Kong, which are useful to health care providers. Occupational therapists, who are specialists in functional assessment and training, can start an appropriate treatment plan earlier to facilitate safe discharge, and collaborate with physicians to select appropriate resettlement plans for their patient after discharge.",

How will changing the definition of AD from a clinical to a biomarker construct change the experience of living with the disease? Knowledge of AD biomarker status can affect how individuals feel about themselves (internalized stigma) and how others judge them (public stigma). Following a review of AD stigma, we appraise how advances in diagnosis may enable or interrupt its transfer from clinical to preclinical stages and then explore conceptual and pragmatic challenges to addressing stigma in routine care.",

Contrary to expectations, there was no significant relationship between activity space size and community integration measures, except a negative association with physical integration. Further analysis revealed, however, that continued use of homeless services, geographically spread throughout the city, was associated with larger activity space size, but may be counterproductive to social and psychological integration efforts. Analysis of the types of locations identified revealed high importance given to leisure locations and ongoing involvement with medical and mental health locations. Finally, community integration outcomes did not differ significantly by demographics or housing type, but rather degree of family involvement and feeling like home, factors that may have more potential for change.",

		"abstract": "The health and healthcare of vulnerable populations is an international concern. In 2011, a Midwestern state within the U.S. mandatorily transitioned 38,000 Medicaid recipients from a fee-for-service system into a managed care program in which managed care companies were contracted to provide recipients’ healthcare for a capitated rate. In addition to cost savings through reductions in preventable and unnecessary hospital admissions, the goals of the managed care program (MCP) included: (1) access to a more functional support system, which can support high and medium risk users in the development of care plans and coordination of care, and (2) choice among competent providers. The population transitioned was a high-need, high-cost, low-income, and low-power group of individuals. The evaluation research team used focus groups as one of many strategies to understand the experience of users during the first two years of this complex change effort. The article explores empowerment in terms of users and their family caregivers’ ability to make meaningful choices and access resources with regard to their healthcare. Specifically, factors empowering and disempowering users were identified within three thematic areas: (1) enrollment experiences, (2) access to care and (3) communication with managed care organizations and providers. While the change was not optional for users, a disempowering feature, there remained opportunities for other empowering and disempowering processes and outcomes through the transition and new managed care program. The results are from 74 participants: 65 users and 9 family caregivers in 11 focus groups and six interviews across two waves of data collection. MCP users felt disempowered by an initial lack of providers, difficulty with transportation to appointments, and challenges obtaining adequate medication. They felt empowered by having a choice of providers, good quality of transportation services and clear communication from providers and managed care organizations. Recommendations for increasing prospects for the empowerment of healthcare users with disabilities within a managed care environment are presented. Resumen La salud y su atención en poblaciones vulnerables preocupa internacionalmente. Un Estado del medio-oes-te estadounidense en 2011 traspasó obligatoriamente a 38.000 receptores de Medicaid de un sistema de pago por servicio a un programa de asistencia gestionada en el que se contrataba a empresas de asistencia gestionada para la prestación de asistencia sanitaria a los usuarios por una cuota por persona. Además de los ahorros por la disminución de admisiones hospitalarias evitables e innecesarias, los objetivos del programa gestionado de asistencia incluían: (1) el acceso a un sistema de apoyo más funcional para usuarios de un riesgo elevado y medio en el desarrollo de planes de asistencia y coordinación de la misma y (2) la elección entre proveedores competentes. La población a la que afecta este traspaso era un grupo de personas muy necesitadas, que entrañaban costes elevados, con un nivel bajo de ingresos y de poder. El equipo investigador de evaluación utilizó grupos de discusión como una de las muchas estrategias para entender la experiencia de los usuarios durante los dos primeros años de este esfuerzo complejo de cambio. El artículo explora el “empowerment” en cuanto a los usuarios y a la capacidad de quienes prestan asistencia a su familia de tomar las decisiones oportunas y acceder a los recursos relativos la prestación de asistencia sanitaria. En concreto, los factores que reforzarían o debilitarían a los usuarios pueden pertenecer a tres áreas temáticas: (1) experiencias de enrolamiento, (2) acceso a la asistencia y (3) la comunicación con las organizaciones con quienes proporcionan asistencia sanitaria gestionada. A pesar de que el cambio no era optativo para los usuarios, un aspecto negativo, aún quedaba margen para otros procesos de capacitación, incapaci-tación y resultados gracias a la transición y al nuevo programa gestionado de asistencia. Se dispone de resultados de 74 participantes, 65 usuarios y 9 personas que prestan asistencia a la familia en 11 grupos de discusión, con 6 entrevistas en dos tandas de recogida de datos. Los usuarios del programa gestionado de asistencia sintieron desvalimiento por la falta inicial de proveedores, los problemas de transporte a las citas y para conseguir la medicación adecuada. En cambio se sintieron reforzados por el hecho de tener una gama de proveedores, una buena calidad de servicios de transporte y comunicación clara por parte de los proveedores y de las organizaciones de asistencia gestionada. Se ofrecen recomendaciones para mejorar las perspectivas de reforzamiento (empowerment) de los usuarios de asistencia sanitaria con discapacidades en un entorno de prestación gestionada de asistencia.",

		"abstract": "Out-of-wedlock status has long been recognized as a demographic risk factor associated with infant mortality and low birthweight. However, the relationship between marital status and birth outcomes varies by maternal race and age. The negative impact of unmarried status is greatest for white women aged 20 and over. High infant mortality rates for married teen mothers challenge the assumption that marriage necessarily provides a protective environment for childbearing. Maternal and child health research and policy have been hindered by a deviance model of out-of-wedlock fertility, which is both biased and outdated. Inconsistencies in the effect of marital status indicate variations in both economic and social resources. Purely behavioral explanations for escalated risks to unmarried mothers are not justified by research findings. Alternative interpretations suggest the need for greater societal involvement in maternal health care created in part by changes in family structure.",

Taking the vantage point of Mehrun, a Canadian Muslim woman with polio, we show that the disability, gender and race constructs converge in some contexts and remain separate in others. This is an important consideration as it forestalls a situation where immigrant womens activist work is seen to be confined to the discrete sphere of their own communities. Mehruns story of migration and settlement as well as her “work” on community integration of persons with disabilities (regardless of race or gender) is a plea for the civil rights of disabled people. At the same time, Mehruns embodied reality as a racialized woman with disabilities suggests the possibility of making her marginality the epicenter of change.",

		"abstract": "Living arrangements and family support for older persons have become an increasingly important policy concern in developing and rapidly aging Asia. Formulating a sound elderly care policy for the region will benefit from empirically examining how living arrangements, particularly coresidence, and intergenerational exchanges of financial, instrumental, and emotional support are associated with old-age psychological health. This study analyzes data from nationally representative aging surveys in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand for 2011–2012 to offer a comparative perspective from Southeast Asia where various kinship systems coexist. Results suggest that coresidence with a child of culturally preferred gender significantly improves the emotional health of Vietnamese and Thai elders but with different implications. In Vietnam, living with a married son is more beneficial to parents psychological wellbeing than living with other children. In Thailand, coresidence regardless of the childs gender improves old-age psychological wellbeing but living with a daughter brings greater benefits than living only with son. Evidence points to the importance of understanding the dominant kinship system that may shape normative filial expectations and gender role expectations within the family. In Vietnam and Thailand, the positive association holds even after intergenerational support is controlled, suggesting that the value of culturally preferred coresidence goes beyond practical functions. In Myanmar, there are almost no significant differences in psychological wellbeing among elderly across various living arrangements, except between coresidence and network living arrangements. For all settings, we do not find evidence in support of network family arrangements as a complete substitute for coresidence in terms of promoting old-age psychological wellbeing after filial support is controlled. Our study highlights important cultural nuances for theorizing the nature of the relationship between living arrangements and old-age psychological health, and presents the important need for more rigorous investigation of the causal links between these two phenomena in future research.",

As a preliminary first step to address these gaps in child welfare research and practice, efforts to identify factors that perpetuate and prolong disparate outcomes in achieving safety, permanency, and wellbeing are sorely needed. Given their contemporary day-to-day experiences in negotiating increasing demands and changing practice and policy procedures, caseworkers who primarily work with Latino children and families involved in the child welfare system were asked to participate in one of four focus groups. Content analyses illuminated factors that increase child welfare involvement and numerous barriers Latinos often experience in accessing culturally congruent services. Caseworkers provided recommendations that focus on developing organizational policies and procedures to address barriers. If disseminated and implemented, these recommendations may play an important role in providing child welfare services that promote positive outcomes among Latino children and families involved in the child welfare system.",

Our review began with a broad search for academic literature on interventions for CASS published between December 2004 and October 2011 in English, Portuguese and Afrikaans. We ordered the findings derived from 33 studies in an ecological broad-based integrative model to have an idea about what we can learn from the academic literature. In a second part of this article we attend to the effectiveness of interventions. One of the main conclusions of this review is that the reviewed articles could not give us a clear picture of what is meant by the long-term objectives of interventions for CASS, which is of paramount importance in evaluating them. Furthermore, we noticed that a Western discourse on childhood is predominantly used in the reviewed articles and in the programs described. Finally, we question whether this is the ideal to which we have to interpret the results of the programs.",

It examines similarities and differences on health, demographic, and caregiving characteristics among elders living with different relations (son, daughter, brother, sister, friend, child plus grandchild, and married child). Three distinctive types of living arrangements are derived from bivariate analyses and subjected to confirmatory factor analyses. Strong support emerges for “dependent elders,” those characterized as living within a married childs household, and by both economic and health disadvantage, as a distinctive type. They are receiving considerable assistance from their married child. Strong support is also evident for “independent elders, ” living in their own household with either sisters or friends, as a distinctive type. While women are more likely to live with sisters and men with friends, both are advantaged, either in terms of socio-economic status or health. Less support was received for the third type, “traditional familial living arrangements,” consisting of those living with all other types of relations. The analyses demonstrate the heterogeneity of those living with someone other than a spouse.",

		"abstract": "Objective: This article reports findings from the National Study of Women with Physical Disabilities about rates of screening for breast and cervical cancer and factors associated with regular screening in a large sample of women with a variety of physical disabilities and a comparison group of women without disabilities. Design: Case-comparison study using written survey. Data were analyzed using measures of central tendency, χ2 analysis, logistic regression, and risk using odds ratios. Setting: General community. Participants: A total of 843 women, 450 with disabilities and 393 of their able-bodied friends, aged 18 to 65, who completed the written questionnaire. The most common primary disability type was spinal cord injury (26%), followed by polio (18%), neuromuscular disorders (12%), cerebral palsy (10%), multiple sclerosis (10%), and joint and connective tissue disorders (8%). Twenty-two percent had severe functional limitations, 52% had moderate disabilities, and 26% had mild disabilities. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes were measured in terms of frequency of pelvic exams and mammograms. Results: Women with disabilities tend to be less likely than women without disabilities to receive pelvic exams on a regular basis, and women with more severe functional limitations are significantly less likely to do so. No significant difference was found between women with and without disabilities, regardless of severity of functional limitation, in receiving mammograms within the past 2 years. Perceived control emerged as a significant enhancement factor for mammograms and marginally for pelvic exams. Severity of disability was a significant risk factor for noncompliance with recommended pelvic exams, but not mammograms. Race was a significant risk factor for not receiving pelvic exams, but not mammograms. Household income and age did not reach significance as risk factors in either analysis. Conclusions: Women with physical disabilities are at a higher risk for delayed diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer, primarily for reasons of environmental, attitudinal, and information barriers. Future research should focus on the subpopulations that were not surveyed adequately in this study, women with disabilities who have low levels of education or income, or who are of minority status.",

The approach emphasizes cognitive and multi-level processes, the development of expert reasoning, and the role of decision support in individual and organizational decision making. The current paper builds on this effort by suggesting a naturalistic, multi-level, theory that can facilitate the dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBPs). The paper presents “Image Theory,” a theory that has been extensively investigated in other disciplines, but has yet to be utilized in medical decision research. It is suggested that its rich, empirically tested, distinctions among kinds of cognitive and organizational processes and types of decisions and tasks make Image Theory especially valuable in describing impediments to implementing EBPs. The paper discusses how naturalistic theory can assist clinicians, administrators, researchers, and policy makers in achieving a balance between evidence-based medicine and patient-centered practice.",

Depressive symptomatology is prevalent among smokers and increases risk for poor smoking cessation outcomes. However, few integrated behavioral interventions simultaneously target smoking and depressive symptoms and rarely have young smokers been included in the development of these interventions. In this paper we describe an 8-session behavioral activation–based treatment for smoking (BATS; MacPherson et al., 2010) adapted for youth. We conducted a series of focus groups with young adult smokers with depressive symptoms in order to modify treatment manuals to be developmentally appropriate. Subsequently, we completed a small pilot group (n=5) of the intervention to provide preliminary data on feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes. We provide a case series of the participants in order to provide clinical illustrations of how the modified BATS treatment was implemented among young adults. Most pilot study participants exhibited smoking abstinence and smoking reductions at the end of treatment, as well as improvement in depressive symptoms and maintenance of levels of activation and environmental reward. Participants provided positive qualitative constructive feedback regarding the intervention.",

Participants shared their energy efficiency stories during focus groups conducted in the Illawarra, Australia. The paper explores how Foucaults concept of governmentality may help inform energy efficiency programs by paying close attention to the way in which individual energy choices made under certain circumstances create who an individual becomes. Learning from participants, our governmentality analysis revealed the tyrannies of thrifty domestic energy conduct. We illustrate our argument drawing on the examples of practices relating to clothing and lighting. We outline how governmentality analysis can be used by researchers, policy makers and practitioners to assist people to safely negotiate energy efficiency in their domestic lives.",

At the macro-level of health economics, for example, a number of future-oriented Quality of Life Instruments (QL) are commonly employed. At the level of individual decision making, on the other hand, Advance Directives (AD’s) are advanced as a means by which healthy individuals can assure their wishes will be carried out if at some future point they are incapacitated. As proscriptive tools, both instrument classes appear to share an axiomatic set whose individual parts have not been rigorously considered. This paper attempts to first identify and then consider a set of five axioms underlying future oriented health planning instruments. These axioms are then critiqued using data from a pre-test survey designed specifically to address their assumptions.

The wraparound approach offers an alternative to both. The current evidence base for wraparound is reviewed and the ambiguity around the definition, values, elements, and requirements for implementing the wraparound approach is addressed. The need to operationalize wraparound is emphasized by a survey, conducted which found that 88% of U.S. states and one out of five U.S. territories implement programs that they identify as wraparound, despite indications that implementation is likely to vary across sites. It is clear that wraparound has been disseminated widely throughout the country, there was reason for optimism that wraparound could be provided more systematically based on the recent publication of a training video, a manual, and standards in several states.",

Traditionally, competency assessments utilize expert opinion based on neuropsychological testing, functional evaluation and competency guidelines and scales. These assessments have implications for an individuals autonomy and present significant challenges to the evaluator. Validated construct definitions and assessment techniques are needed to advance knowledge and practice. In this article, current methods and problems of competency evaluations are reviewed. From this, a construct validation approach to the problem is described. Next, three theoretical frameworks related to ontological perspectives for competency constructs are presented to illustrate different ways of conceptualizing competency. These theoretical frameworks can be used to identify assumptions and organize approaches to assessment and research and are presented as starling points to organize future research and practice.",

This study evaluated the performance of 5 such instruments. Design: A cross-sectional survey with instruments administered in random order during computer-assisted interviews. Setting: A midwestern US veteran SCI program. Subjects: One hundred eighty-three veterans with SCI ranging in age from 21 to 81yrs (mean = 50.5). Measures: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) HRQoL modules, the Quality of Well-Being scale (QWB), the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 and Short-Form 12 (SF-36, SF-12), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Results: Construct validity was supported by scores from the QWB, IADL, and physical health measures of the BRFSS and SF-36 showing greater impairment for quadriplegia than paraplegia. Similar constructs on the SF-36 and BRFSS were more strongly correlated than between the IADL and QWB; eg, correlation between the SF-36 Vitality scale and the BRFSS “Days full of energy” question was r = .789 (p < .01), whereas correlation between the IADL and QWB was r = −.454 (p < .01). Longer surveys (SF-36, QWB) were rated lower in subject acceptability. Conclusions: These instruments have potential for research use among patients with SCI. More studies are needed to explore the best use of instruments with apparently different domains.",

		"abstract": "Deficits in social and role functioning are central to schizophrenia. Social skills training (SST) and family psycho-education (FP) have been widely used psychological treatments intended to improve the community functioning of schizophrenic patients, and to reduce the burden on relatives living with patients. This paper is a review of recent studies in which the clinical effects of SST and FP have been assessed. SST consistently improves the social skills of schizophrenic patients, but there has been inadequate assessment of the transfer of skills to patients day to day lives. It is unclear if clinically significant change in patient functioning in the community can be obtained with SST. Relative to no treatment, FP improves interaction between schizophrenic patients and their relatives, and reduces family burden and patient relapse rates. FP is an important component of effective clinical management of schizophrenia. Future research needs to better assess the clinical significance of the effects of SST, the effects of SST and FP on patients negative symptoms and social role functioning, and the sources of the considerable individual differences in patient responses to both SST and FP.",

The present study, informed by a developmental epidemiology framework, examined the unique impact of out-of-home placement and the mediating effects of child maltreatment and homelessness on the academic achievement and school adjustment of an entire cohort of second grade children in a large urban school district. Data on birth risks, placement history, child maltreatment, and homelessness from birth through second grade were integrated across municipal agencies for over 11,000 second grade students. Multiple Logistic Regression analyses demonstrate that children with a history of out-of-home placement were at increased risk for poor literacy and science achievement controlling for demographics and birth risks. These children also evidenced significantly higher levels of behavior problems and school suspensions than children with no out-of-home placement history. Maltreatment and homelessness were found to have significant mediating effects on the relationship between out-of-home placement and childrens educational well-being.

PRS applies modem communication technology to protect older adults living in the community by sending an automatic telephone call for help if a person at home cannot use normal means for signalling an emergency. The study sample consisted of older adults (N = 553) living in rural areas of Arkansas and enrolled in a Medicaid waiver program for community-based services. Nurse case-managers evaluated the participants in their homes and decided whether PRS should be prescribed. Fifty-two percent of respondents were prescribed PRS free of charge by the nurse case-managers. We entered the three sets of characteristics into an adapted version of Andersens behavioral model of health services utilization (Andersen, 1968, Andersen, 1995). We used logistic regression to evaluate the effects of predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics relationships in relation to receipt of PRS. Based upon multivariate analysis, four variables—living alone, cognitive and physical function, and race—had statistically significant direct effects on PRS prescription. In other words, after adjusting for the effects of predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics, cognitive intactness and living alone had the strongest positive effects on receiving PRS, followed by being Caucasian and having difficulties performing activities of daily living (i.e., assistance needed with bathing, dressing, toileting, and moving in/out of bed/chairs). Our results should be of value in designing, planning, and implementing PRS systems in rural areas.",

This article presents the case for proactively developing a strategic accessible tourism approach by presenting a brief background to the area. First, the article outlines the relationship between access, disability, ageing and tourism. Second, it reviews the development of easy access markets and accessible tourism, and places these in context to universal design. Third, the article overviews pertinent legislation that shapes the accessible tourism environment in Australia. Fourth, accessible environments are placed within context to destination management and accessible destination experiences. The article concludes by presenting four contemporary Australian examples of accessible destination experiences within broader destination management approaches.",

In this study, ongoing discourse from 40 transcribed medical visits with an elderly patient, family caregiver, and physician were analyzed. Interactive behaviors that support patient self care capabilities and those that support dependency are identified and described, and patterns of interaction related to the patients cognitive or sensory impairments are explored. The presence of a family member at an older patients medical visit—in combination with the authoritarian traditions of medical care, assumptions about frailty and aging, and true impairment—appears to trigger behaviors that marginalize the patient and that are supportive of dependent self care. Behaviors that support independent self care are less evident. An awareness of this tendency toward dependent supportive interactions may enable physicians, family members, and patients to change this pattern, breaking the cycle of increasing dependence and supporting instead the patients adult independent status in the clinic setting.",

Not only did this expose a gap within sociological research on health and medicine, it also gave new impetus to long-standing debates within sociology of knowledge and epistemiology. But not only academia discovered self-care. It was a key issue of the most influential social movement of the seventies, the womens movement, although often expressed in a terminology very different from that in academic quarters. And it was debated heavily in the medical system based on the growing popular interest in self-help and wellness. When it first emerged therefore, self-care was both an academic and a political issue—and it was unavoidable that the two should not only influence each other, but at times clash.",

		"abstract": "Indonesias recent history has revealed the fragility of a national unity created under a political authoritarianism that was itself underpinned by the countrys relative economic success. The governments transmigration resettlement scheme has been one particularly powerful mechanism through which the New Order government (under President Soeharto) has sought to achieve unity amidst the countrys disparate ethnic groups. By resettling Javanese people, Indonesias largest and most politically central cultural group, the state has attempted to achieve a presence of the “centre” in the countrys “margins”, and in turn, extend a particular imagined geography across the archipelago. This paper examines the spatial politics of this process in one particular region, where transmigration has been coloured by environmental authoritarianism and concerns over the activity of “illegal forest squatters”. It draws on Henri Lefebvres concept of socially produced space to demonstrate how local people have challenged the spatial authority of the state, and the ways subtle forms of resistance are expressed in agrarian landscapes and livelihood practices in Lampung. The paper concludes by reflecting on the possibilities of linking such resistance to emerging social movements which are beginning to challenge the post-Soeharto governments authority outside Java.",

Using interviews with middle aged and elderly polio survivors, the author identifies key cultural categories, the expectations and values linked with disability and describe the strategies people use to confront, or not, the erosion of personhood. The importance of understanding the category of the person, its historical setting, and evolution are highlighted.

		"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2006.08.018",
		"abstract": "Background The concept of caring is described as intangible, abstract, and invisible in nursing practice. This has translated into a view of caring as a personal choice or natural obligation rather than a deliberate process. While there has been movement to delineate caring within nursing in general, the psychiatric nurses perspective on caring has been absent from theoretical works and measures constructed to describe nurses work. Objectives To develop a substantive grounded theory of caring from the perspective of Registered Nurses working with patients in three Canadian acute psychiatric hospital settings. Design The qualitative research design of grounded theory methodology was used to develop a theory of caring. Settings Three urban, acute psychiatric hospital settings in Canada. Two were general hospitals and one was a psychiatric hospital. Participants Registered Nurses (N=17) licensed with the College of Nurses of Ontario. Method In-depth interviews with Registered Nurses were conducted using theoretical sampling. The data were analysed using constant comparative analysis. Results Protective empowering is the basic social psychological process that represents Registered Nurses’ caring with patients in acute psychiatric hospital settings. Nurses accomplish protective empowering through six main categories of: (1) respecting the patient; (2) not taking the patients behaviour personally; (3) keeping the patient safe; (4) encouraging the patients health; (5) authentic relating; and (6) interactive teaching. The six main categories were accomplished through 27 subcategories. In the theory of protective empowering, the goal is to help patients participate in activities contributing to convalescence, health, and/or quality of life. Conclusions The theory of protective empowering provides six main categories and 27 subcategories that can be transferred to funding formulas, patient health record documentation systems, nurse orientation and education programs, nurse role descriptions, and used in guiding discussions about organizational values of patient-centred care within a collaborative multidisciplinary context.",

The results indicated that in this sample, residential satisfaction corresponds to a four-dimension structure organized by physical location rather than psychological or behavioral aspects. The four components were the local area, access to services, relations with neighbors, and the home itself. Satisfaction with each component was related to different predictors, supporting the idea that elders hold complex and nuanced views of their homes and neighborhoods.",

		"abstract": "With increased emphasis on functional outcomes in ophthalmology, third-party health care payers and research funding agencies have turned their attention to the development and use of visual function questionnaires. Since 1980, more than a dozen such self-report visual function questionnaires have been developed. All of these instruments include items that ask about specific daily activities; patients must respond with a rating that represents the level of difficulty that they experience with the activity described. This article reviews all of the known instruments, with special attention paid to their validity and reliability. Most validation studies have reported high response consistency across items and significant correlations of instrument scores with visual impairment measures. Only two studies have measured test–retest reliability. The developers of visual function questionnaires typically divide the items into several different subscales, suggesting that different variables are being measured. Although the items are very similar for the different instruments, there is little agreement among instruments on the definition of subscales. All instruments are scored as the average of the ordinal patient ratings across items for each subscale and/or for the total instrument. Measurement issues underlying the scoring of ordinal patient ratings are discussed. It is argued that unless the instruments can be converted to interval scales, the averaging of patient ratings does not yield true measurements. The three visual function questionnaires that were calibrated with a statistical item response model, which estimates interval scales, are reviewed. It is concluded that future research and development should devote additional attention to the measurement properties of functional assessment instruments.",

Even so, grounds for concern exist regarding the evidence-base for these and other sanctions. Methods This paper describes the heterogeneity of sanctioning within juvenile justice and argues that, despite substantial advances in research, the heterogeneity severely delimits the generalizability of evaluations to date. It also raises questions about how much is in fact known about the effectiveness of many juvenile justice sanctions. Conclusion Extant research offers grounds for optimism. Even so, explicit articulation of the limitations of this research and the need for studies that examine external validity is important for developing evidence about “what works” in juvenile justice. Implications for research and policy are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Objectives To identify and critically appraise potential participation measurement tools for children aged 18 months to 17 years with power mobility (PM) needs. Data Sources Searches in 9 electronic databases identified peer-reviewed publications in English to January 2015, along with hand-searching included bibliographies. Study Selection The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was followed with inclusion criteria set a priori. Keywords and subject headings included participation and measurement terms with descriptors of young people who are potential PM candidates. Publications describing measurement properties of English-language tools were included if the items included ≥85% content related to participation and described at least 2 participation dimensions. Data Extraction Two reviewers reached consensus after independently screening titles and abstracts, identifying full-text articles meeting criteria, extracting data, and conducting quality ratings. Tool descriptions, clinical utility, and measurement properties were extracted. Study quality and measurement properties were evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments checklist and the McMaster Outcome Measures Rating Form. Data Synthesis Of 1330 titles identified, 138 peer-reviewed publications met study inclusion criteria. Fifty tools were identified, of which 20 met inclusion criteria. Evidence supporting reliability and validity varied considerably. Two tools had responsiveness evidence, an important measurement property when evaluating change. Quality ratings were strongest for internal consistency and content validity. Ratings were downgraded because of small sample sizes and a limited description of missing data or study conditions. Conclusions While potential tools emerged (Assessment of Preschool Childrens Participation, Preferences for Activities of Children, Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation, Child Engagement in Daily Life, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, Questionnaire of Young Peoples Participation), none were judged best suited for use with children having PM needs. Further empirical studies with this population are needed before recommending use for PM applications.",

Objectives To evaluate existing interventions that support family caregivers in providing pain management to patients with all disease types. Methods Four electronic databases were systematically searched (PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and Scopus) using index and keyword methods for articles published before December 2019. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality. Results The search identified 6851 studies, and 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two studies exclusively focused on noncancer populations (8%). Three types of interventions were identified in this review: educational interventions, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and technology-based interventions. Both educational and cognitive-behavioral interventions improved family caregiver and patient outcomes, but the content and intensity of these interventions in these studies varied widely, and there was a limited number of randomized clinical trials (68%). Hence, it is unclear what strategies are most effective to prepare family caregivers in pain management. Technology-based interventions were feasible to support family caregivers in providing pain management. Conclusion Providing adequate pain management training can improve patient and family caregiver outcomes. However, the most effective interventions for family caregivers are still unclear. More rigorous and replicable clinical trials are needed to examine the effects of educational interventions, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and technology-based interventions. Also, more studies are needed in patients with a noncancer diagnosis or multimorbidity.",

Unlike earlier research, we found considerable reciprocity in network transactions with family and friends. Only professionals provided more support than they received from patients. Providing emotional support to others was positively correlated with positive affect, community integration, and mastery. Respondents reported more supportive than unsupportive transactions with network members and more supportive transactions with friends than with family or professionals. Finally, residents of supportive apartments and group homes provided and received support more frequently than residents of board-and-care homes.

The recommendations were derived from a systematic search of the best available evidence in the scientific literature, supplemented by information from documents retrieved upon reviewing the identified articles. While most recommendations could be based on empirical studies (although of varying quality), some had to be based on expert opinion alone, but were deemed necessary as well. Another limitation was that the wide variety of service models and service traditions for the mentally ill worldwide often made generalisations difficult. In spite of these limitations, we arrived at 30 recommendations covering structure, process and outcome quality both on a generic and a setting-specific level. Operationalisations for each recommendation with measures to be considered as denominators and numerators are given as well to suggest quality indicators for future benchmarking across European countries. Further pan-European research will need to show whether the implementation of this guidance will lead to improved quality of mental healthcare, and may help to develop useful country-specific cutoffs for the suggested quality indicators.",

		"abstract": "Within medical geography there has been a surge of interest in applying critical concepts in social theory to empirical settings, including those for persons with disabilities. The ways through which persons with disabilities negotiate space vary widely according to material and social experiences of being disabled. For older women, chronic illness as a type of disability shapes the way in which they approach their daily lives with respect to both the physical and social aspects of their home environments. In the first half of the paper, conceptually, I take a relational view of space and argue that household, as a narrow reading of domestic space, needs to be replaced by home environment which incorporates more fully age- and ablement-sensitive readings of the spaces constitutive of domestic space. This lays the basis for a contextualized socio-spatial understanding of the ways older women with chronic illness negotiate the spaces in home environments because it accounts for the disadvantaged positionings of access to power and resources as well as the uneven distributions of income based on gender, age, and (dis)ability. It also takes into account the material and social aspects of being disabled. In the second half of the paper, I present case studies of three older women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis to illustrate these arguments.",

The community attitudes toward community placement of mentally retarded persons appear to be based on a core set of assumptions. First, it is assumed that the most appropriate residential placement is generally in the normal community, which to most professionals suggests a home and neighborhood much like the place in which they choose to live. A second assumption is that placement in large, isolated institutions is the result of hostile community attitudes toward the mentally retarded and that these same attitudes are a major source of the problems that have arisen in trying to establish small “community residential facilities” (CRFs) for mentally retarded persons. Third, it is assumed that community resistance is irrational and unrealistic and that if community members only knew the truth about the retarded and CRFs, they would be supportive. Finally, it is assumed that verbally expressed attitudes relate to overt behavior, for example, resistance to CRFs.",

		"abstract": "This paper discusses the importance of using macro-level variables for program analysis. It is argued that three types of macro variables—cultural, economic, and demographic—provide a context for evaluation, and offer alternative explanations for the success or failure of a program. The problems of causality and availability of data are discussed. Macro variables are seen to be especially useful in “meta evaluation,” and in integrating the results of specific program evaluations into general conclusions.",

		"abstract": "Federal and state needs assessment mandates have traditionally been criticized both by their originators and by the local human service agencies that are required to conduct these studies as part of the planning process. This paper presents some preliminary evidence that local opposition to assessment may be shrinking as agencies gain a new appreciation for the varied uses of assessment information. Using data from a sample of Wisconsin agencies the prevalence of assessments between 1979 and 1980 is described and the conditions surrounding the practice of needs assessment are outlined. Particular attention is given to factors that affect the utilization of needs assessment results, including the characteristics of the sponsoring agency, the attributes of the study, and the structure of the assessment process.",
