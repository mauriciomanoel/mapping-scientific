The second wave drivers and adopters were the largest cloud service providers (CSPs) worldwide with the concept of application-specific cloud servers (ASCPs). A competitive advantage for these players and initial barrier to entry to smaller players was the nonrecurring engineering (NRE) cost to design and manufacture the desired customizations. However, as platform providers and consumers went through the learning curve and achieved increasing technology maturity, the benefits of customization became democratized and available to smaller CSPs.",

abstract="Cities all over the world are becoming increasingly smarter, including Dubai Smart City. The Smart Cities vision is to automate critical public services, make improvements for community interaction, and achieve significant levels of efficiency in a connected and technology-driven society, such as in traffic control. However, this has positioned Smart Cities to be a target of compromised Cyber Security, which can potentially undermine the information systems of local departments, general security, law enforcement, and transport systems. Dubai is a dynamic and emerging economy that has the potential to become a major economic center of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region owing to its strength in strategic information. The main purpose of this paper is to explore, evaluate, and discuss components of overall strategic security, innovation, management, and the development of Dubai in terms of Cyber Security. This study also showcases conducted survey results based on the Smart City Cyber Security program. Furthermore, it demonstrates the current and future challenges faced by Smart Cities from cyber-threats, including the development of strategic security plans to defend against sophisticated cyberattacks, and encourages citizens to take responsibility and implement awareness of how to proactively counter cyberattacks on Smart Cities. However, it is imperative to evaluate the strategies that are required to prepare Dubai's Electronic Security Center to align with Dubai Vision 2021 in order for Dubai to be one of the securest Smart Cities in terms of Cyber Security around the globe. This research aims to argue that to develop Dubai's Electronic Security Center, strategies should be a top priority for Dubai to ensure the security of the Smart City and to diminish cybercrime in Dubai.",

abstract="Every city has a heart and soul of its own and may claim same rights as a human being. In early 2017 the court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be accorded the status of living human entities [1]. The decision, which was welcomed by environmentalists, means that polluting or damaging the rivers will be legally equivalent to harming a person. The judges cited the example of the Whanganui River, revered by the indigenous M{\={a}}ori people, which was declared a living entity with full legal rights by the New Zealand government. The judges said the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and their tributaries would be ``legal and living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities''. So, if we are to recognize the entire city to be a living entity, just like a smart human being, a smart city would also require constant monitoring of its health. Just like a human being using a smart band or a smart watch to sense his/her vital parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, glucose, heart rate, lipid profile, Vitamins etc. the smart city may also require several thousand sensors installed in its arteries and touch points to sense its vital organs. Just like a smart band transmitting vital statistics of a human being to a cloud, the measurement of sensors from the smart city touch points also requires to be transmitted to the cloud. Just like the human vital statistics are subjected to triggering health alerts in the event of spotting an anomaly, the smart city sensor data will also have to be subjected to rigorous analysis to observe if an anomaly of ill health to the smart city is spotted in any of its key node and alerts are triggered to the city guardians for immediate treatment. Furthermore, the process of diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and monitoring of human health becomes applicable for a smart city too. This chapter is divided into 4 sections, essential for smart city Practitioners drawn from smart Dubai's use cases. Part 1 examines the technology and application of Internet of Things (IoT) for establishing a smart environment. This part will focus on the environmental parameters that can be sensed in a smart city? What kinds of sensors are required? What data do they generate and how do they get transmitted to the cloud? Part 2 delves into IoT Platform where the IoT data is stored, managed and secured along with the survey of IoT platform providers? Part 3 illustrates smart environment use cases of IoT and the parameters that can be sensed in a smart city. Part 4 gives a detailed account of the initiatives taken by Smart Dubai for smart environment management that can be adapted or replicated in other smart cities around the world.",

In other words, given their ubiquity presence, AmI and the IoT are increasingly seen as a promising response sustainable development challenges due to their potential to enable substantial energy savings and GHG emissions reductions in most economic and urban sectors, and to address societal challenges in area of social inclusion, social justice, and healthcare. However, AmI and the IoT have a number of potential risks, uncertainties, and concerns in relation to sustainable development that need to be understood when placing high expectations on and marshalling resources for such technologies by visionaries and research leaders. With the growing concern about their multiple environmental effects and social ramifications, AmI and the IoT visions are worth attention and further research. This chapter aims to investigate the risks that AmI and the IoT as forms of, and advances in, S{\&}T pose to environmental and societal sustainability, and to address the eco-environmental aspects of technology in relation to ecological modernization and transition governance. I argue that there are intricate relationships and tradeoffs among the positive impacts, negative effects, and unintended consequences for both the environment and the society, flowing mostly from the development, use and disposal of AmI and the IoT technologies throughout the information society, and pertaining to the digital divide, technological and socio-demographic gaps, inherent in the design of new technologies, respectively. The intention of this attempt is to offer people of modern, high-tech societies the relevant resources with which to evaluate---analytically, environmentally, and ethically---the gains and the risks, the safeties and the perils, of AmI and the IoT as notable advances of in S{\&}T.",

abstract="The rapid pace of innovation and advances in technological research has given hope to the visually impaired people (VIP) to find ways to move around smart cities and enjoy a better quality of life (QoL). There are around 110 million people suffering from visual impairments worldwide, and research will continue to be conducted to discover innovative solutions to improve their mobility. The rise in smartphones and wearable devices, along with the surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented reality (VR)/(AR), has provided aspirations for VIP to enjoy a better QoL. Moreover, smart cities also support the concept of sustainable economic growth and the well-being of their citizens; therefore, their development relies on strong ICT infrastructure. A number of studies have already tested the use of these technologies, showing optimistic results. The main sectors that could be improved to cater for VIP in smart cities are public areas, transportation systems and home systems. This chapter provides a comprehensive review and recommendations on how a smart city can provide better QoL for VIP in the near future.",

abstract="IoT refers to an emerging paradigm that consists of a continuum of unique things that communicate with each other to form dynamic global networks. IoT, such as objects, appliances, and sensors, is the network of unique identified connected devices with computing services. The IoT term is relatively new and has been the concept of combining computers and networks to monitor and control devices for decades. For example, by the end of the 1970s electric grid remote monitoring meters via telephone lines had already been used in commercial use. Advanced wireless technology has also become extensive for the machine-to-machine companies and industrial solutions for monitoring and operation of equipment where closed-end networks or proprietary industry-specific standards have been used instead of Internet Protocol (IP) and internet standards. Since the beginning of the use of IP to connect devices in the early 2000s, a robust research and development field in the networking of intelligent objects leads to the foundation of IoT today. The term IoT is now popular for scenarios in which internet connectivity and computing capabilities extend to a variety of objects. The idea behind the IoT can also be seen in Fig. 4.1. A refers to technology globalization (anytime, anywhere, any device, any device, any network, etc.) and C reflects IoT's collection, convergence, connectivity, computing, etc. properties. But the IoT of today has extended beyond the A and C range.",

However, such procedures can also lead to user privacy issues. This study describes what citizens do and do not know about Wi-Fi tracking and how that knowledge affects their responses to privacy and security risks. The results of this study showed that there is a lack of awareness towards Wi-Fi tracking by people in the municipality studied. The results show that most respondents are willing to cooperate with Wi-Fi tracking, despite the fact that most people have concerns of losing control about how their data is gathered and used. This study also found that respondents indicated Wi-Fi tracking as useful and especially safety is appointed as an important benefit of Wi-Fi tracking. The results of this study confirm that privacy, trust and perceived benefits significantly influence the willingness to disclose personal information.",

Smart and user-oriented environment, as defined in the 1980s to be fully integrated or in the millennium of 2000 considering user as an innovator, cannot be concluded to be the mainstream today in housing or in workplaces in commercial or public buildings or in industrial facilities. Nevertheless, the development of smart technology during last 4--6 decades has resulted to a strong ``smart back end''---borrowing the term in software development. This technological readiness bears a good potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living and working conditions even beyond the currently targeted energy efficiency. New applications for digitalized societies are expected to chance all paths of life. Service fusion based on individual rights on one's own data is a key parameter for deep connectivity in information flows and consequently in operations. Platformization together with equitable and secured heavy open data exchange is employed in production, decision-making, smoothening of daily living, etc. to make current silos disappear.

Applications of IoT can be broadly classified based on consumer application, enterprise application, infrastructure management, industrial productivity, and so on. Some of the applications that implement the concepts of IoT are smart wearables, connected cars, industrial internet, precision agriculture, smart retail, energy management systems, and others. Advancement in IoT technology has resulted in automated home appliances and healthcare systems and also in the development of smart cities, smart homes, smart towns, and many more. For any application based on IoT, data are collected and are modeled using prediction analysis. The basic concept of using IoT is that it reduces waste, loss, and cost. The design of the IoT application should focus on increasing the energy efficiency and the cost efficiency of the system, improving safety, or creating better experiences. IoT is a field of the network, and it could be enabled either by wired or wireless communication networks. This refers to the technology where the machines could predict the data and work by itself. Here the devices that are connected to the private internet connection could communicate with others. The edge devices that are connected will create a huge amount of data. These data are generated at high speed, and also they face challenges like storage, computation, and networking. These issues can be handled by using cloud, edge, or cloud edge computing.

The management of environmental resources which is largely common property call for strengthening smart community capabilities for environment resources management by designing a system and protocol for environment resources management as appropriate and consistent with environmental governance of a smart city. The environment is made itself smart to be self-aware by using IOTs and ICTs and E-Governance tools based on existing environmental legislation and E-Democratic management practices are applied for environment resource management by the smart community to intervene 24 h and 7 days a week. The required directive principles of Environmental Democracy are presented side by side with faith-based approach. This approach requires a well-trained smart community with continuing environmental education and competence to meet environmental challenges which is one of six components of the smart city system. Since humans are one component of Environment and integrated, the smart living that conserves environment is the answer to the smart environment. An integrated global cooperation which considers the environment as shared common resource shall complement this effort. Religious practice is a way of life which in turn leads to a smart environment through smart living. The community shall be guided by their own Faith which is a way of life that considers environment having a distinct interface of deep ecology and religion (whether it is Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity or Islam and so on). This chapter describes an integrated approach to smart environment for smart city, and scientific, and religious faith based, as well as the deep ecology-based interface for environment governance and management. The cultural system underlying the Vedic and Buddhist religion which is in practice in several Asian countries as examples are presented which can further strengthen the Smart Environment for Smart City approach through faith based smart living.",

Planning for a smart city that has sufficient legs to remain current for even a few years seems incredibly difficult. How can city planners have the insight of an Arthur C. Clarke or a clairvoyant to design smart cities that remain vital for even as long as several decades into the future? Technological innovation, social interaction on the Internet, globally linked economies, and increasing trade in services and intellectual property in today's digital ecosphere are all combining to accelerate the rate of change. The concept of an increasing rate of acceleration is known to physicists by the highly technical term known as jerk. That is the term for a fourth order exponential of change over time.",

It explains how Cognitive Computing has been used in IoT through different forms such as Cognitive NetworkCognitive network, Cognitive DevicesCognitive devices, and Cognitive AnalyticsCognitive analytics. The desirable properties of the CIoT are mentioned. A special discussion is presented on how CIoT has taken automation to a new level. Realizing CIoT is not straightforward for the reason that it is a complex system and is quite different from other computing systems we have been familiar with. The implementation challenges along with the societal and ethical apprehensions of CIoT have been identified and discussed in detail. The business world is showing great interest in IoT and subsequently in CIoT. Considering that, we have highlighted the business values of CIoT and some prospective application areas along with a few prominent use cases.

abstract="In broad context, e-Governance is a functional subsystem under e-Democracy, since Governance and hence, entire Government itself is an important section of democracy itself. Hence, smart city development is in fact, the transformation of approach in their futuristic contexts towards responsibilities, interests and rights of all its stakeholders; such as citizens, government, administration, services, utilities, etc. Globally, consistent focus for financial growth and quality of life has ultimately resulted into unprecedented rise in consumption of electrical energy. Electrical power management in India has become a critical issue with rising population, increasing life expectancy, economic growth and, more importantly, due to vibrantly changing and difficult to predict weather. Electrical power supply has always been a resource in deep scarcity in India, so 24 * 7 electricity is an issue causing concern. Efficient decision-making at different levels rely upon reliable availability of electricity, which has been an integral element of citizens' life, therefore stable and sustainable power management, especially supply reliability is a need of today. Government of India has launched a Smart City Mission for building 100 Smart Cities, in which 24 {\texttimes} 7 availability of electricity has been one of the major focus. Historically, electricity generation, transmission and distribution decisions have been the exclusive domain of utility companies, domain experts, bureaucrats or sometimes political interventions, but now a paradigm shift could be observed towards citizens' participation and active involvement. Sufficient electricity being the mandatory element of a smart city necessitates an inclusive and participatory management of this resource. Smart electricity management in upcoming smart cities encounters challenges in the urban electricity management through smart grid via integration of ICT and e-Democracy. Smart Grid as an energy backbone of smart city is immensely vital and serving at the core of Smart City realization. Evolving e-Democracy, smart grid includes highly interactive participation of citizens in energy consumption domain, based on humanitarian and customer centric approach. Different types of prosumers (producers + consumers), their different energy requirements at different timings, different types of energy resources and their switching feasibilities considering different aspects have been integrated. Under National Smart Grid Mission, Government of India has launched Restructured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme for funding Smart Grid initiatives and Gujarat has been one of the leading states of India as far as self-reliance and reforms like solar city, smart grid, etc. are concerned. Renewable Power Plants and Smart Grid Pilot Projects implemented in Gujarat have been proved models and case studies for other locations. Moving ahead from our earlier contributed chapter ``E-Governance for Photovoltaic Powergrid: Solar City Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India'', in the book E-Governance of Smart Cities, in this chapter, we now present citizen-centric approach of design-implementation of smart grid with case study of pilot project at Naroda, Ahmedabad.",

The main goal of this proposed project is to harness the emerging IoT technology to empower elderly population to self-manage their own health and stay active, healthy, and independent as long as possible within a smart and secured living environment. An integrated open-sourced IoT ecosystem will be developed. It will encompass the entire data life cycle which involves the following processes: data acquisition and data transportation; data integration, processing, manipulation, and computation; visualization; data intelligence and exploitation; data sharing; and data storage. This innovative cloud-based IoT ecosystem will provide a one-stop shop for integrated smart IoT-enabled services to support older people (greater or equal to 65 years old) who live alone at home (or care homes). Another innovation of this system is the design and implementation of an integrated IoT gateway for well-being wearable and home automation system sensors with varying communication protocols. The SMART-ITEM system and services will appropriately address the following: (i) smart health and care, (ii) smart quality of life, and (iii) SMART-ITEM social community. The development of the system will be based on the user-centered design methodology so as to ensure active user engagement throughout the entire project life cycle and necessary standards as well as compliances will be adhered to (e.g., security, trust, and privacy) in order to enhance user acceptance.",

abstract="Smart healthcare network is an innovative process of synergizing the benefits of sensors, Internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics to deliver improved patient care while reducing the healthcare costs. In recent days, healthcare industry faces vast challenges to save the data generated and to process it in order to extract knowledge out of it. The increasing volume of healthcare data generated through IoT devices, electronic health, mobile health, and telemedicines screening requires the development of new methods and approaches for their handling. In this chapter, we briefly discuss some of the healthcare challenges and big data analytics evolution in this fast-growing area of research with a focus on those addressed to smart health care through remote monitoring. In order to monitor the healthcare conditions of an individual, support from sensor and IoT devices is essential. The objective of this study is to provide healthcare services to the diseased as well as healthy population through remote monitoring using intelligent algorithms, tools, and techniques with faster analysis and expert intervention for better treatment recommendations. The delivery of healthcare services has become fully advanced with integration of technologies. This study proposes a novel smart healthcare big data framework for remotely monitoring physical daily activities of healthy and unhealthy population. The framework is validated through a case study which monitors the physical activities of athletes with sensors placed on wrist, chest, and ankle. The sensors connected to the human body transmit the signals continuously to the receiver. On the other hand, at the receiver end, the signals that are stored and analyzed through big data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to recognize the activity. Our proposed framework predicts whether the player is active or inactive based on the physical activities. Our proposed model has provided an accuracy of 99.96{\%} which can be adapted to remotely monitor health conditions of old patients in case of Alzheimer's disease by caregivers, rehabilitation, obesity monitoring, remotely monitoring of sports persons physical exertion, and it can also be beneficial for remotely monitoring chronic diseases which require vital physical information, biological, and genetic data.",

abstract="Cities are the future of humanity and for the coming majority, their next great home. This rapid urbanization of the planet presents great challenges and, at the same time, great opportunities. On the one hand, the concentration of people in urban spaces provides numerous economies of scale but, on the other hand, also implies the potential generation of negative externalities that must be managed by a ``smarter city'' to find a balance. Mobility in cities, the fact that moving in a vehicle (fuel, electric, shared, autonomous), public transport or other means is becoming a common, difficult and complex congestion problem for cities, has negative economic consequences. This enormous pressure for efficiency and the search for solutions are making significant inroads into the incorporation of ICT in smart cities and subsequent large-scale digitization to resolve this issue and other setbacks. This deployment needs to be conducted with a broad perspective incorporating economics and human concepts such as digital assets or citizen incentives in city strategies because in cities, people and resources are key players.",

The combination of different systems aimed to monitor different aspects of the smart city (such as e-health, air quality monitoring, gas, water and electricity monitoring, or emergency situations detection among others) can be used to create a more sustainable and a securer city. In this chapter, we propose an architecture that combines the data from different systems. However, in this scenario, the amount of traffic generated for each device must be considered. Therefore, we propose the use of data aggrupation in each antenna in order to reduce the amount of generated traffic in the 5th Generation (5G) network and thus the energy consumption. The IP of the original device and its data is grouped with the data and IPs of other devices forming a packet with all the data from one system. Thus, the generated traffic is reduced because we use a lower number of headers to transmit the same information. The system has been tested with e-health data from 250 people and three health sensors. The results show that data aggrupation saves up to 70{\%} of the generated traffic.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) introduces many intelligent applications that are closely attached to humans' daily activities. This advanced technology attempts to bridge the gap between the information world and the physical world. Recent studies investigate efficient, flexible, scalable and reliable IoT systems that not only control things and devices on behalf of humans but adaptable to humans' preferences. However, the autonomous control of the IoT in a smart home or healthcare environment subjects to many factors such as human health, time and date. For example, peoples' needs and behaviours during workdays differ from weekends or a young person needs and behaviours differs from an elderly person. Hence, the practical setting of a smart home entails flexible management to the autonomous control of IoT systems. This paper proposes an architecture of Adjustable-Autonomous Multi-agent IoT (AAMA-IoT) system to resolve a number of the IoT management of control and application interface challenges. The AAMA-IoT is applied in an elderly smart home simulation in which autonomous agents control passive things such as a chair or door and active things such as a television or an air conditioner. The test results show that the AAMA-IoT system controls 14 things with average activities recognition accuracy of 96.97{\%}.",

Such smart buildings monitored by Building Automation Systems (BAS), which have started demonstrating rapid growth potential on account of rising energy costs, stringent scarcity of fossil fuels for power stations and continuous abnormal-unpredictable climate changes, etc. Smart buildings with energy efficiency are need of the day and frequent terrorist attacks and rising security concerns worldwide, security and surveillance have been major focused areas today, where BAS are providing solutions. This chapter keeps its major emphasis not only on automatic monitoring of critical parameters, but also suggest technological approaches. Optimized utilization of energy usage, integration of renewables as well as with smart grid (energy backbone of smart city) shall also be covered in broad perspectives. The chapter shall suggest useful guidelines and recommendations for smart building automation for smart cities with interesting discussions of example case studies and implemented proof of concepts.",

The current chapter introduces the concept of IoT, highlighting the factors and motivation pushing towards a more connected world; hence the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) and in the more extreme scenario the Internet of Everything (IoE). To begin, the term ``Internet of Things'' is explained in the first subsection, emphasizing the need for such concept, highlighting the enablers of IoT and their added value. The chapter then moves forward to highlight how OFSs can be integrated in IoT applications, to provide a more added value at lower costs. After a brief introduction of IoT, each subsection tackles a different category of IoT applications, where OFSs are seen to play a role in the very near future. It is worth mentioning here that the current chapter is not intended to provide a complete view of IoT and should not be treated as one. The chapter is alternatively dedicated towards discussing the use of OFSs within IoT.",

abstract="The developments and improvements in human computer interaction (HCI) and information and communication technologies (ICTs) have marked the emergence of a number of new assistive technologies for the People with Disabilities (PWDs). Although, there have been many new ideas and technologies for assisting the PWDs, to improve their quality of life, still their applications are hampered depending on the impairment type, and environment. In fact, few of these existing assistive technologies have considered the workplace environment, especially in smart cities. In this research work, a comprehensive smart unified solution has been proposed for the PWDs at the workplace, which plays a major role in the smart cities. The developed solution which is multi-modal in nature addresses multiple input and output methods to alleviate different kinds of impaired persons using a single solution. This system will help the PWDs to actively communicate with others through the flexible interface and obtain help information from the smart cities' environment such as the health context aware services. The interface is called as flexible because it can be adapted to meet the different requirements. This solution can support a wide domain of the PWDs existing with different combinations of the disabilities. Hence, with this system, the users can exhibit the ability to manage their system interface using multi-model ways of interactions through the use of speech recognition engine, text-to-speech, mic, and mouse/keyboard, etc.",

To do so, we build predictive models to learn the relationship between depression level changes and behaviors using historical data. We also deploy the system for a group of elderly, in their homes, and run the experiments for more than one year. Our experimental study gives encouraging results, suggesting that our IoT system is able to correctly identify >80{\%} of the elderly at risk of becoming more depressed, with a very low false positive rate.",

The R{\&}D community has been well-aware of these changes and over the last few years has come up with new AAL approaches. This chapter discusses the changes that the new demographic scenario implies and the major forces that shaped it.

Many efforts have been already done in the direction of SEs development and in the implementation of platforms specifically designed for SE realization. Anyway, such efforts miss of solutions regarding the interoperability among the realized SEs and other third-part ``Things''. This chapter gives an overview of iSapiens, which is a Java-based platform specifically designed for the development and implementation of SEs. iSapiens tries to overcome the interoperability issue by leveraging the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm that allows to dynamically include in an SE the new ``Things'' that can appear in an environment without requiring interventions from humans. iSapiens provides tools for the realization of pervasive SEs and relies on the edge computing paradigm. Such paradigm is extremely important in a distributed system since it allows to use distributed storage and computation at the edge of a network, so reducing latencies with respect to move all the executions and storages in the cloud. Moreover, the chapter will review some SE applications realized by exploiting iSapiens concepts.",

abstract="To realize the Internet-based sociotechnical systems, it is necessary to build a comprehensive and effective infrastructure to support the interaction between various cloud services on the Internet and the physical world in which we live. For example, the information produced by the sensors is usually aggregated, processed and analyzed by services in the cloud, which can be used by various stakeholders for decision-making in many different application fields. Therefore, we need to consider integrating the Internet of Services (IoS), which enables the flexible sharing and composition of cloud services on the Internet, with the Internet of Things (IoT), which represents the constellation of things equipped with various sensors and actuators. The integration of IoS and IoT often involves multiple parties and so must deal with complex issues such as interaction, dynamics, scalability and decision making, all of which can be studied from a multiagent perspective. In this paper, we start by discussing the necessities and challenges for integrating IoS and IoT. Then, we propose an integrated architecture and examine it from two multiagent perspectives. One is to regard the integrated architecture of IoS and IoT as a multiagent-based architecture considering various patterns of service composition and interaction. The other is to apply multiagent methodologies when designing sociotechnical systems for various application domains based on the integrated IoS/IoT architecture. Moreover, we use the example application of designing multilingual environments to discuss the above two perspectives with possible future research directions.",

abstract="``Internet of Things'' (IoT) is expected to revolutionize the application of services by enabling the creation of smart spaces such as smart cities, smart houses, smart transportation, and smart outdoor monitoring (SOM) in the near future. Such smart spaces will require the deployment of a significantly large numbers of devices connected to the Internet such as sensors, actuators, and wearable computing devices and the likes. The growing population in urban areas will pose a significant challenge toward the utilization of public resources. Smart cities provide a promising solution by enabling a smart and efficient way to handle challenges such as waste management, traffic, security, and so on. Consequently, there is a large number of devices deployed in a smart city so as to enable collection and transition of data and data analysis. Therefore, communication is a key aspect in a smart city topology. In this work, we provide an overview about how the IoT provides an efficient communication platform and how 5G will be the main enabler by providing competitive bandwidth, high integrity, low latency, high spectral efficiency, and viable network capacity.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) has become most rising technology in IT. The IoT world becomes very smaller, and the possibilities of IoT are endless. The center of attention of IoT is in the area of smart health, industrial (real-time analytical, automation) education, smart farming, connected home (security thermostats), connected cities (like smart meters). Although Internet of things (IoT) is becoming the essential aspect of every person's life and making the life comfortable, on the other side there are some challenges and problems which are also found in the Internet world. These issues make the smart world more unsafe and challenging like privacy issue, security, reliability, scalability, and interoperability. In these days, problem of incompatibility of devices is at high risk that makes things more expensive. So there is a need to tackle the interoperability problem. This paper proposed a model-driven approach (MDA) for making devices compatible. In the thesis, authors worked on platform independent model (PIM) and computation independent model. Computation independent model (CIM) is captured for the information and transferred into the platform independent model and Unified Modeling Language (UML) tool generate the Java code as a vocabulary.",

abstract="Indoor environment quality (IEQ) has a significant impact on health and in all human activities. On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterised by numerous pollution sources that can lead to relevant unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, experimental testing requires the supervision of several indoor parameters, such as the case of thermography experiments. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies, there is a great potential to create automatic solutions for IEQ supervision. In fact, due to people spend about 90{\%} of our lives indoors, it is crucial to monitor the IEQ in real-time to detect unhealthy conditions to quickly take interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health. Buildings are responsible for about 40{\%} of the global energy consumption, and over 30{\%} of the CO2 emissions; also a considerable proportion of this energy is used for thermal comfort. This paper aims to present a solution for real-time supervision of laboratory environmental conditions based on IoT architecture named iLabM. The solution is composed by a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and smartphone compatibility for data consulting. The iLabM provides temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and qualitative air quality data supervision in real-time. The smartphone application can be used to access the collected data in real time but also provides the history of the IEQ data. The results obtained are promising, representing a significant contribution to IEQ monitoring systems based on IoT.",

For the first time, small devices with tiny batteries can connect virtually everywhere and directly to the internet. This game-changer for the Internet of Things (IoT) offers Telco's exciting opportunities. Currently, there are competing LPWA technologies available, which facilitate a variety of strategic options. Key differentiator between the technologies is the choice between using unlicensed or licensed spectrum as well as using standardized versus non-standardized technology. More importantly, LWPA requires a fundamental reassessment of the business models. Incumbent technologies fuel business models that are based on bandwidth consumption growth. LPWA however requires alternative models for monetization. Furthermore, Telcos must consider specificities of LPWA use cases and build powerful ecosystems in order to realize the full potential of the technology: revenues are driven by the sheer volume of devices as well as the opportunity to offer services on top of connectivity. The LPWA opportunity is still fresh and many challenges must yet be overcome not only by Telcos but also by other players in the ecosystem. However, by keeping in mind the different aspects and factors described in this article, Telcos will be rewarded by being able to lead in exploiting promising use cases enabled by LPWA technologies and thereby to enter the IoT mass market.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) creates an intelligent, invisible network fabric that can be sensed, controlled and programmed, in ways that enable artefacts to communicate, directly or indirectly, with each other and the internet. This network is rapidly and increasingly evolving into the networked connection of people, processes, data and things (i.e., the web of ``everything''). While the latter promises to improve our lives, by anticipating our preferences, optimizing our choices and taking care of many daily habits, the evolution of IoT is likely to raise new legal and technological challenges. This paper examines four challenges in the fields of privacy and data protection. Drawing on today's debate on the architecture, standards, and design of IoT, these challenges concern: (i) the realignment of traditional matters of privacy and data protection brought on by structural data sharing and new levels and layers of connectivity and communication; (ii) collective, rather than individual, data protection; (iii) technological convergence, e.g. robotics and other forms of artificial agency, that may impact some further pillars of the field, such as data controllers; and, (iv) the relation between technological standards and legal standards. Since, properly speaking, we still do not have a universal IoT, current debate represents an opportunity to take these legal challenges seriously, and envisage what new environment we may wish.",

abstract="Stroke is a brain attack (or infarction of a portion of the brain) caused by the sudden disturbance of blood supply to that area. In recent years, even though the number of stroke-related deaths has been decreasing in Korea, the incidence of stroke is increasing, and the incidence increase with age. The chances of surviving from an acute and sudden infarction are much higher if the elderly people get emergency medical assistance within a few hours of occurrence. Elderly health monitoring and emergency alert system are mentioned as one of the main application areas of pervasive computing and biomedical applications. Moreover, a proactive elderly health monitoring system involves active capture of brain and body movement signals, signal analysis, communication, detection and warning processes. The primary objective of this research will be concerned itself with ambient assisted living issues for the successful detection and generation of alarms in cases of stroke onset, which will allow the timely delivery of medical assistance, to mitigate the long-term effects of these attacks.",

Elderly health, daily life and other aspects of the problem with modern information technology, intelligent service facilities or product do not match the contradiction is increasingly prominent. At the same time, sensory function and action ability of the elderly are in the continuous degradation. Their cognitive and learning level is limited, which leads to experiencing smart home hardily. Therefore, it is imperative to study and improve the interaction design of smart home products for the elderly. In this paper, the contradiction between the design of smart home products and the demands of the elderly in daily life is studied under the mode of medical care and pension, as well as case analysis of smart home products for the elderly. The purpose of the paper is to study the type and interaction design of smart home products for the aged. The main method is through the investigation and user analysis of smart home, finding the principles and characteristics of interaction design from the products. Research shows that intelligent products can be divided into three types under the mode of medical and pension: smart home appliances, smart home management system and call monitoring system. Through the mobile Internet, intelligent terminal and touch screen control, smart home can meet the needs of the elderly users seamless, which will be a trend in the design of smart home products.",

For improved safety, mobility and efficiency of the transport system a real time communication between Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) and Infrastructure to Infrastructure (I2I) is mandatory. Real time database helps in improving the development of Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS), Advanced Vehicle Control System (AVCS), Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO), Advanced Public Transport System (APTS), Advanced Rural Transport System (ARTS), etc. Different countries developed different models of ITS suited to their own specific conditions. There are some limited case studies and implementations occurred in India. A full fledge ITS could not developed looking into the Indian perspective. The traffic condition, vehicle management and infrastructure requirements need lot of up gradation in this respect. The major case studies referred in this are ATMS trail done across Chennai (2009), ATIS in Bangalore and Hyderabad, APTS in Bangalore, Chennai and Indore. The Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) across different places across India as an alternative to metro rail at Pune, Ahmedabad and Chennai. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) and Advanced Parking Management are some of the application of ITS which gained certain ground across India. Ultra low power Bluetooth 5 technology, 5G Networks and Cellular IoT concept creates lot of opportunities in realizing ITS in India.",

In the chapter, case studies have been divided into geographical categories (Middle East cities; North-European cities; Mediterranean cities and the Asian ones) which, macroscopically, refer to three different types of city and communities especially in relation to different levels of technological innovation and type of human capital, which are key factors in the achievement of a smart development. The chapter is divided into four main paragraphs. The newly built cities, in the Middle East paragraph, are cities where everything has been planned from scratch on white paper to limit emissions and increase the quality of life of citizens. In the paragraphs about the North-European cities and the Mediterranean cities, the cities with strong historic value are described. In this section, many European cities, which have specific features like limited possibility to apply technology, but still an adequate level of development to understand and correctly implement the ICT driven choices are described with reference to the smart city concept. The last paragraph shows some example of ``developing city'' that often are cities with low awareness about sustainable settlement issues, but with a great economic and social growth. These are, in most cases, eastern cities; they show a great potential and are gradually, within the world community, trying to create the basis to become leaders of smart cities development.",

abstract="In order to enhance and improve the quality of ``public services'', a sound and clear quality management concept is needed. From the process perspective, ``high quality'' means that a process must deliver satisfaction---the ultimate output variable of any process. A smart city uses information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to increase the quality of its services---which should result in the high satisfaction of the inhabitants. In this chapter, we present a literature overview of benchmarking municipalities and our own primary research of benchmarking satisfaction in over 41 municipalities in Switzerland. As a case study, we show also a benchmarking project conducted in 2013--2014 with the cities of Lublin (Poland) and St.Gall (Switzerland). This chapter will show a framework of a performance dashboard for benchmarking municipalities and how to implement best practice from other municipalities. The key finding of the benchmarking process is to learn from best practice municipalities (the ``between analysis'') and identify the variables which drive satisfaction in a municipality (the ``within analysis''). The chapter ends with a discussion on how a smart city can employ the data derived from ICTs to refine the aforementioned benchmarking process. Our conclusion is that it is vital to embed the smart city concept in a management system that helps decision makers to steer the municipality in a complex environment. To illustrate this point, we show synergies of traditional quality management and smart government approaches in fostering the value of benchmarking outcomes.",

We outline the twofold way in which this integration of public libraries into smart city planning is taking place. First, through the integration of smart city technologies---sensors, dashboards, and data analytics software---into the physical fabric of libraries. Second, and most significantly for this book, the incorporation of new services and spaces into libraries that support the underlying agendas of the smart city---to transition citizens, businesses, and government into a `smart', `creative', and `sustainable' postindustrial knowledge economy.",

abstract="The chapter presents a Cloud-based framework that can be tailored to be used in different scenarios of urban planning and management occuring in Smart Cities. The focus is on the management of large-scale socio-geographic data obtained through the trajectories traced by smart objects. Our goal is to mine human activities and routines from this socio-geographic data in order to catch user's behaviour. To this aim, we introduce a methodology for trajectory pattern mining consisting in (a) finding frequent regions, more densely passed through ones, and (b) extracting trajectory patterns from those regions. Experimental evaluation shows that due to complexity and large data involved in the application scenario, the trajectory pattern mining process can take advantage from a parallel execution environment offered by a Cloud architecture.",

They envisioned use of physical tags that allow remote, contactless interrogation of their contents; thus, enabling all physical objects to act as nodes in a networked physical world. Realization of this vision will yield benefits in diverse areas including supply chain management and inventory control, product tracking and location identification, and human-computer and human-object interfaces [200].

abstract="With the recent standardization of Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) as a category of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) technology by the 3GPP, the endless possibilities it brings for IoT development cannot be overemphasized. Nigeria as a developing nation, has continued to struggle in the development and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The approach of this paper is basically to critically analyze the current state and the technological deficiencies of IoT development in Sub-Saharan Africa by using Nigeria as a case study, and to show how the emergence of NB-IoT can help to significantly improve the penetration and optimal development of this relatively modern technology in Nigeria and consequently in Africa, as it is in developed nations. Relevant features of NB-IoT are enumerated, we propose possible NB-IoT use cases that are suitable for the Nigerian eco-system and finally, we give a summarized developmental plan for the mobile network operators (MNOs) in Nigeria.",

IoT is currently fast forwarding towards embracing a paradigm shift namely Internet of Everything (IoE) where making intelligent decisions and providing services remains a challenge. Context plays an integral role in reasoning the collected data and to provide context-aware services and is gaining growing attention in the IoT paradigm. To this end, a Context-Aware reasoNer (CAN) has been proposed and designed in this chapter. The proposed CAN is a generic enabler and is designed to provide services based on context reasoning. Discovering and filtering entities, i.e. entity configuration, become pivotal in analysing context reasoning to provide right services to right context entities at the right time. This chapter leverages the concept of entity configuration and CAN towards enabling an IoT controller. The chapter further demonstrates use cases and future research directions towards generic CAN development and facilitating context-aware services to IoE.",

abstract="By following previously conducted studies by various researchers, private corporations, and public offices around the globe, people have found out various loopholes not only regarding the ground aspects of a failing system but also the somewhat manipulated officials who generally short come in fulfilling their duties toward a continuous development and modifications to our cities. Even though, every annual budget highlights the capital investment made for the growth of various services fabricated for a city, I am still unable to provide an impact for the public, which results in an overall failure of our master plan to provide for a better living of the public. In this paper, I focused on the facts and hurdles that an administration faces while trying to deliver smart services to develop a smart city. In that framework, I included six of the most essential domains that have already been introduced in two major smart cities in India which can effectively contribute in the enhancement of currently developing models of smart city which were used by those two cities earlier. Altogether, I elaborated how each component has proved its worth in either one or both the cities and integrate it into a new developed model. Using the devices which used the concepts of things based on Internet, I formed conclusion regarding how a city can be upgraded into a smart city taking the lessons from two of the already declared smart cities, Jaipur (JAI) and New Delhi (DEL).",

abstract="Internet-of-Things (IoT) is one of the most important new paradigms and technological advances in the realm of the soon-to-be-present-in-every-household (and nearly every business), Internet-powered cyber-physical systems of this decade and likely years to come. We are interested in the distributed intelligence, agent-based programming and multi-agent systems aspects of what it will take to enable the reliable, secure, inter-operable and human-friendly Next-Generation IoT, and in particular, Internet-of-Agents (IoA) as the IoT's software and computational intelligence foundation. Several key software design and computational intelligence aspects of IoT/IoA are discussed in this paper. We first address suitable programming abstractions for the software agents that would provide IoT's inter-operability, enabling different users, devices and platforms to effectively communicate and coordinate with each other. We then review some desiderata for the Next-Generation (NG) IoT middleware design. To address cyber-security for IoT holistically, we outline some elements of computational intelligence that would enable the self-healing and self-recovery capabilities of the NG IoT. We argue that the design of NG cyber-defense, self-healing and self-recovering mechanisms could greatly benefit from exploring paradigms from biology -- in particular, from the immune systems of living organisms. If such highly adaptable self-healing capabilities were built into the NG IoT, future cyber-attacks would cause much less disruption to the infrastructure and the end-users than what was the case with some recent cyber-attacks on the present-day IoT.",

abstract="Internet of things is a shifting paradigm where almost every physical object will be furnished with sensing, communication and processing capabilities that allow them to communicate with other devices. On the other hand, machine to machine communication, which is a key enabling technology for the internet of things, enables billions of multipurpose networked devices to exchange information among themselves with minor or no human involvement. This chapter aims to investigate a novel communication strategy that considerably increases the efficiency of the channel in the multicast setting. Specifically, we consider the scenario where three devices that are close by and want to exchange their messages via a low cost relay or another device in proximity. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is twofold: (1) use of joint channel and physical layer network coding where devices simultaneously transmit their messages, (2) no decoding at the relay where relaying can be as simple as amplify and forward or de-noise and forward. Furthermore, an efficiently scalable technique for disseminating information among a large number of devices is proposed. Simulation results using practical Raptor codes show that the proposed scheme achieves a near optimal sum rate performance. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with traditional single user communication scheme and functional decode and forward relaying strategy.",

abstract="The concept of `Smart City' has witnessed widespread applications across several city planning and development domains with specific emphasis on achieving smart sustainable cities. These concepts are seen to have evolved across the horizontal and vertical domains of the city governance, administration, planning and development and among others sectors. The overall approach is aimed at enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, financial improvement and among other benefits. Some of these approaches have high technology dependence, while the other ones use a hybrid system which adopts specific measurable frameworks within the city working eco-system. Eventually, these Smart City approaches cuts across several multidimensional domains of city governance, administration and planning systems. This chapter introduces and discusses two concepts around Smart City in terms of conceptualization and measurement of Smart City. First, it discusses a conceptual methodological framework for contextualizing Smart City through a concept/approach of City Life Cycle (CLC). Second, it discusses a conceptual framework for measurement of Smart City which is based on integration of various functional and process-oriented approach across horizontal and vertical layers/dimensions of smart infrastructure, smart solution and smart governance within the broader context of socio-technical regimes. The conceptualized methodological framework for assessing Smart City can be applied at any stage of contextualizing a Smart City or evaluating a Smart City during post implementation of smart programmes and projects.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigms have emerged in the last years, thus generating new challenges in the pervasive computing area. IoT is a computing paradigm that has been recognized for allowing the connection of the physical and virtual worlds by giving processing power to the daily ``things''. IoE goes beyond the IoT by breaking the barrier of just ``things''. In IoE, the people, data and processes also make part of the connected world. Context awareness has becoming an important feature in IoT and IoE scenarios. Automatic decision making, sensitivity to context, automatic notification to the user, just to name a few, are some examples of situations where a context-aware system is needed in these environments where the characteristics of the data sources are undergoing constant change. In this chapter we present the context-aware definitions and architecture in IoE and it evolution from IoT. Moreover, we present the context-aware life-cycle phases, which is the process done in order to have context information. In addition, we also analyze the current context-aware approaches of IoT/IoE systems, and present some challenges related to context-aware IoE systems.",

Thus, single reference architecture cannot be used as a blueprint for all possible concrete implementations. While a reference model can probably be identified, it is likely that several reference architectures will coexist in the internet of things. In this context, architecture is specifically defined as a framework for specifying the physical components and functional organization and configuration of a network, operational principles, and procedures, as well as data formats used in its operation. In fact, IoT is like an umbrella around all possible computer devices around us. Therefore, the IoT architecture should be open enough with open protocols to support a variety of existing network applications. Additionally, some middleware for scalability, security, and semantic representation should also be included to promote data world integration with the internet. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the internet of things architectures.",

Energy, the electrical power in particular, has been the most crucial and the resource always in scarcity in India and proving itself as a major bottleneck. Therefore, India has been transforming legacy conventional non-smart non-intelligent unidirectional electrical power grids into modern smart grids which are bidirectional and intelligent in nature by leveraging ICT, IoTs, e-Governance and e-Democracy. Smart grids are likely to serve as energy backbones of smart cities and involve high interactive participation of citizens in energy management, based on humanitarian and customer centric approach. Different types of Prosumers (Producers + consumers), their different energy requirements at different timings, different types of energy resources and their switching feasibilities considering different aspects have been integrated. The Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar twin city metropolitan region (Naroda area) has been considered as region of interest and study. The region is surrounded by reputed industrial, commercial, educational-research organizations, heritage monuments and demonstrates extremely encouraging potential for creative research and technological developments with variety of Prosumers in particular. To study existing economic and spatial strategies and recommend suggestions for smart metropolitan region development have been main objectives of the work presented. Useful approach for smart metropolitan region development has been presented by effective energy management, active citizen participation and e-governance by proposing deployments of smart grid and smart buildings with integration of renewables, ICT and IoTs.

abstract="The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) is still relatively nascent in society, as are the regulations that accompany IoT. At the heart of IoT is the use of data captured by the sensors, whether that be personal data or proprietary data. This data is processed by the cloud and is used to inform decision making and actions driven by the actuator. Particularly where sensitive data is concerned, IoT can put the privacy of individuals at risk. Examples discussed include Alexa, the Amazon virtual assistant, and connected pacemakers. IoT devices do provide many benefits, from convenience in the home, to tracking health and well-being. However, consumers are often blind to the risks associated with the sharing of personal data, until a big breach of that data occurs. It is thus the responsibility of technology organisations and governments to come together to educate society about the value of their personal data and be more transparent about the way in which they process the data. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a step in the right direction; however, other nations need to adopt similar rules to ensure the privacy of individuals is protected.",

This complex matter is further complicated as many individuals and their families may not be well-informed of the available services or feel disempowered, or appear unable or unwilling to express their needs. Nevertheless, activism and the need for safeguards and provisions of equal rights and access have led to many significant national and international laws and regulations that specify some of the requirements that must be met.

abstract="Since the end of 2014 a definition on ``smart cities'' agreed by international standardization bodies exists. As commonly said in the business community, `measurement is the first step leading to control and eventually to improvement. If you can't measure something, you can't understand it. If you can't understand it, you can't control it. If you can't control it, you can't improve it' (H. James Harrington). Therefore, if we want to understand what the smart cities initiative is all about we have to start measuring its brand new definition. After that we'll be able to monitor and control the performance of cities in terms of smartness, and this will lead to the possibility of improvement. In this research we present a set of indicators that specifically serve to measure the newly agreed and acknowledged international definition on smart cities. This set of indicators will be now tested to measure the smartness of the city of Girona, a small-medium sized city in Spain. At the completion of this pilot we'll be able to design an index summarizing the set (or subsets) of indicators, as a future steps of this research. A summarizing index will help to get an overview and to understand the overall performance of a city in terms of smartness.

abstract="As access to health care is important to people's health especially for vulnerable groups that need nursing for a long period of time, new studies in the human sciences argue that the health of the population depend less on the quality of the health care, or on the amount of spending that goes into health care, and more heavily on the quality of everyday life. Smart home applications are designed to ``sense'' and monitor the health conditions of its residents through the use of a wide range of technological components (motion sensors, video cameras, wearable devices etc.), and web-based services that support their wish to stay at home. In this work, we provide a review of the main technological, psychosocial/ethical and economic challenges that the implementation of a Smart Health Caring Home raises.",

Chronic diseases are the most common causes of death and disability worldwide. These types of diseases require more and more studies to help patients and notify cases of crises that lead to death. Representing knowledge through building an ontology for emergency alert system is important to achieve semantic interoperability among health information, predict the patient real-time context and to better execute decision notification. Linked Open Data services are used in our paper in order to provide with the semantic description of collected data from different sources (wearable sensors, environmental sensors, etc.).",

IoT is an intelligent environment where objects become smart and autonomously communicate with one another and human beings, through networks supported by interfaces. The IoT technologies have not only been widely studied in simulation and investigational circumstances but also dealt with real world scenarios. The IoT systems are enhanced by surveying diverse interactions between humans and the IoT to mine the implanted intelligence about individual, environment, and society. The IoT is facilitated by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and internet protocols. In the upcoming years, the IoT is expected to bridge various technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. The spotlight of this chapter is to present the support of intelligent human-computer interaction for the IoT and to deal with human-centered concerns in the IoT.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)-based data gathering solutions were envisioned from the beginning of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm because of their important characteristics such as low-cost, long-term versatile sensing and actuation capabilities, and distributed resilient bidirectional communications. However, many technologies converge into WSN platforms from several disciplines. Their complexity and rapid pace of change may prevent most WSN and IoT players to keep up, since they need to focus on low cost and short development time targets. Also important is the quality assurance to prevent the degradation of the overall reliability perception needed for wide WSN adoption. Consequently, a versatile and reusable WSN platform may benefit both industry and academic research by speeding up and facilitating the distributed WSN application programming. The framework presented provides the application developers with a set of development tools and software component libraries that allow high-level application architecture description, graphical definition and simulation of the component behaviour, and automatic generation of both network simulation models and code for target node programming.",

abstract="The safety of people and spaces is of paramount importance for societies. With time, the implementation of safety measures is rapidly changing from a need to a priority. Video surveillance systems play a key role in the surveillance of crucial and critical areas as these systems help the authorities keep places safer. With the rapid growth of technology and the implementation of the smart city concept, it is becoming possible to develop and deploy wide area surveillance systems. The ease with which these systems can be installed in private and public spaces (e.g., homes, streets and parks) allow for the creation of ubiquitous monitored environments. Rapid intervention responses to any abnormal situation or the use of recorded video as evidence are some advantages of the use of this type of surveillance systems. Although ubiquitous video surveillance systems are relevant for present modern societies, their cost is still high. To solve or, at least to mitigate this problem, a low-cost smart surveillance system was developed, which is presented and described in this paper. The developed surveillance system, based on available low-cost technology, can help keep critical spaces under surveillance 24/7. The proposed solution was found to have a minimal cost, a low bandwidth, and to be scalable and adaptable to every client's needs. Thus, the solution can be used by anybody (private and public) and applied in different contexts (e.g., residential, industrial). The system can provide still images, captured from surveillance video cameras, real time video and real time video processing, which can be used for motion detection. When this happens, the user is warned via an e-mail containing the identification of the respective surveillance camera. Only the relevant video events are sent, recorded and maintained in the cloud platform system, consequently reducing the amount of storage space required to maintain all the historical video events. The results of the tests carried out show that it is possible to stream a video from the surveillance cameras with an insignificant delay and that motion detection can be attained through real time video processing. The system presented potentiates a low-cost solution for a smart city in the surveillance field.",

Now research is going on-how to transform healthcare industry by increasing efficiency, lowering costs and put the focus back on better patient care. The Internet of Things will be a game changer for the healthcare industry. With an intelligent system and powerful algorithms, one can obtain an unprecedented level of real-time, life-critical data which is captured and analyzed to drive people in advance research, management and critical care. Taking care of patient's health at very low cost is an important factor. The main idea of applying IoT in healthcare is move out from traditional area to visit hospitals and thus waiting will come to an end. The concept here is that it can be able to sense, process and communicate with biomedical and physical parameters so that they can work on it.

Despite the intended definition of a horizontal architecture approach (i.e., a common system approach to manage different application domains or verticals) for IoT middleware has been one of the main requirements by global IoT projects during the last years, the imminent arrival of 5G technology is revealing that current middleware approaches possibly will face some challenges due to new application requirements imposed by 5G (e.g., big data bandwidth and infinity, reliable, and efficient capability of networking, joining massive user experiences on mobile communications with multimedia sharing). In this way, this chapter not only presents concepts and architectural layers of IoT Middleware, but also helps in the identification of future challenges and further perspectives regarding the IoT Middleware ability to provide pervasive systems services able to cope with 5G-based application requirements in IoT environments.

abstract="Internet-related technology has been of high importance for businesses since the internet emerged. With the Internet of Things, a new (and probably lasting) era of internet-related business operations has just begun. Complex embedded IT-systems that are continuously connected to the internet enable modern products to operate themselves autonomously. This not only opens up new markets, but also creates legal challenges, which will be detailed in this chapter. Connected products collect a huge number of data; this does not only heavily touch on core principles of (European) data protection law, but is also a potential source of liability risks. This chapter illustrates both aspects using various examples. Businesses deploying the Internet of Things are subject of a variety of legal obligations that are, due to their rigidity, contrary to the nature of the Internet of Things. Being obliged to ask individuals whose data are processed for informed consent and the need to implement security mechanisms that comply with all data security requirements but are nevertheless cost-effective are not the only challenges for businesses. As there is no uniform legal framework concerning liability in Europe, businesses face liability under numerous and equally diverse national laws. This raises the question whether the current national regulatory framework is still adequate given the fact that the Internet of Things, with its approach to connect things globally via the internet, blurs boundaries.",

abstract="The main body of research clearly highlights the world's population is rapidly expanding. When this fact is combined with the increase in life longevity due to medical and social advances it alters the demographic balance in relation to age. Hence, the number of people aged 65 and over is constantly increasing. The potential of Smart Technologies and IoT-based devices to improve health has increased rapidly in the last few years and users are now in a position to contribute to the development of the interaction process and need to be properly trained on benefits of using new technologies. IFTTT (If This Then That), Blockly, and other similar tools provide a new perspective on web-based services, and represent an innovative and inclusive instrument to manage small automated tasks between Internet-connected devices by using a simplified interaction approach. The main research question of this work is: how could senior users benefit and adopt smart devices in a proficient way and how can emerging technologies such as automation services enhance safety, health and well-being for people with different abilities? The research method is based on a participatory, Inclusive Design approach, developed through interviews and focus groups, among a restricted number of people of different age and gender, design and usability tests in the further stage. The aim of the work is to make existing technologies more accepted, usable and inclusive for as many people as possible. This goal will be achieved by analysis and by creating a set of interactive and easy to use information and tools for automating different processes, to improve the performance in Activities of Daily Living and increase the connection and socialization between citizens, their family and friends. Applets for Seniors could be seen as a different approach to enable users with different abilities in interacting in a friendly way with new technologies and could be also used as a User Experience facilitator for people who are not familiar with smart devices.",

abstract="IoT systems and devices are being used for various applications ranging from households to large industries on a very large scale. Design of complex systems comprising of different IoT devices involves meeting of security requirements for the whole system. Creating a general security framework for such interconnected systems is a challenging task and currently we do not have standard mechanisms for securing such systems. The first step towards developing such a framework would be to build a classification mechanism which can identify the security capabilities or parameters of the different entities comprising an IoT system. In this paper we describe one such mechanism which can take user input to classify the different components of a complex system and thereby determine their capability to support security mechanisms of different degrees. This in turn would enable designers to decide what kind of security protocols they need to adopt to achieve end-to-end security for the whole system.",

Conceptually, it is possible to enable Internet connectivity to anything such as cloths, TVs, machines, cars, {\ldots}, etc. IoT is a futuristic application of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main characteristic of WSNs is that it is an ad-hoc network for enabling the communication of humans with the surrounding physical environment. On the other hand, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is considered the replacement technology for the traditional identification techniques such as barcode systems. One of the challenging research areas is the integration of both IoT and RFID technologies together such that it will be possible to have the advantages of both of worlds. This chapter discusses how does the unique characteristics of our RBS lightweight cryptosystem makes it a strong candidate of RFID security in IoT applications. The chapter then explains how to integrate IoT systems with the RFID technology and the pros and cons of such integration from security point of view.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) constitutes one of the most important technological development in the last decade. It has the potential to deeply affect our life style. However, its success relies greatly on a well-defined architecture that will provide scalable, dynamic, and secure basement to its deployment. In fact, several challenges stand between the conceptual idea of IoT, and the full deployment of its applications into our daily life. IoT deployment is closely related to the establishment of a standard architecture. This architecture should support future extensions, and covers IoT characteristics such as distributivity, interoperability, and scalability. A well defined, scalable, backward compatible, and secure architecture is required to bring the IoT concept closer to reality. In the literature, several architectures have been proposed. Nevertheless, each architecture brings a share of drawbacks, and fails covering all IoT characteristics. In this chapter, we review the main proposed architectures for the Internet of Things, highlighting their adequacy with respect to IoT requirements. Firstly, we present IoT building blocks. Then, we introduce the high level architecture of IoT before diving into the details of each proposed architecture. In addition, we introduce a classification of the reviewed architectures based on their technical aspects, and their ability to match IoT characteristics. Finally, based on the main shortcomings of the proposed architectures, we conclude with some design ideas for shaping the future IoT.",

The framework consists of 16 parameters with one to four yes-or-no-questions each and allows the users to bring in their own weights for the different parameters. We assessed 110 devices which had 94 different policies. Furthermore, we did a legal assessment for the parameters to deal with the case that there is no statement at all regarding a certain parameter. The results of this comparative study show that most of the examined privacy policies of IoT devices/services are insufficient to address particular GDPR requirements and beyond.

To estimate the behavior of the entire network at early stages of development, the presented approach allows the simulation of components that are not yet available. It acts as a gateway by translating device-specific protocols in a representation that can be handled sufficiently by the underlying network simulation.

abstract="Internet Of Things (IoT) is increasingly used throughout the world in different fields. But it does not have a standardized definition [28]. Several definition can be proposed. IoT corresponds to ``objects with virtual identity and personality, working in a smart environment and using smart interfaces to connect and communicate in some various context'' [3]. IoT is a sum of entities that are used to exchange information in different contexts. This is a network of connected objects communicating between them to extend their functionalities [17]. The IoT is larger than just a system: it is a system of system. Each one can be divided in sub-system and assimilated to a specific technology [5]. The IoT is ``a dynamic infrastructure of a global network. This global network has auto-configuration capacities based on standards and communication protocols interoperable. In this network, physical and virtual objects have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities and smart interfaces and they are integrated to the network in a transparent way'' [31].",

abstract="We live in a world that continuously wants to live in a smarter manner, from the invention of fire and the wheel through the Industrial Revolution to today. Modern home automation started in the Victorian era with labour saving devices and the motor car facilitated transport, as did trains. The onset of electricity allowed more labour saving devices to be developed, again in the home and at work. These were typically `standalone' devices that needed localised control. In the 1940s industrial control systems were making their presence felt in industry. In 1978 the X10 protocol was patented and allowed remote control of electrical appliances. In the last twenty years there has been a thrust towards `smart everything', including cities, transport, health, home and work. Without understanding the risks of the `smart approach' to life and addressing them at the outset, the world risks disaster.",

abstract="Internet of Things is mainly about connected devices embedded in our everyday environment. Typically, `interaction' in the context of IoT means interfaces which allow people to either monitor or configure IoT devices. Some examples include mobile applications and embedded touchscreens for control of various functions (e.g., heating, lights, and energy efficiency) in environments such as homes and offices. In some cases, humans are an explicit part of the scenario, such as in those cases where people are monitored (e.g., children and elderly) by IoT devices. Interaction in such applications is still quite straightforward, mainly consisting of traditional graphical interfaces, which often leads to clumsy co-existence of human and IoT devices. Thus, there is a need to investigate what kinds of interaction techniques could provide IoT to be more human oriented, what is the role of automation and interaction, and how human originated data can be used in IoT.",

As the smart city movement is spontaneous, each city pursue its own goals prioritizing smart initiatives of different nature: sometimes the use of ICT prevails, some others green energy production is at the core of smart programs; and so on. This chapter studies two smart city best practices in Europe: Amsterdam and Genoa. Amsterdam has been the first city all over the world implementing a smart city strategy addressing not only one dimension of living, but with a comprehensive scope. Genoa won the highest number of European calls funding smart city projects and the Genoa Smart City Association is aiming to compose an integrated smart projects portfolio addressing all the aspects of the metropolitan life.

abstract="Recent advances in the Internet of things (IoT) have led to renewed interests in the integration of wireless sensors, ubiquitous connectivity, and ambient intelligence technologies for developing contextually intelligent smart homes for the elderly. While tremendous results have emerged out of these efforts, the question of how to support the elderly to interact meaningfully and intuitively with intelligent devices in an IoT-enabled smart home environment remains underexplored. The different shades of physical and cognitive impairments that come with aging mean that the elderly require a uniquely different personalization approach for engaging with digital technologies. As a result, designing effective models of interaction for smart home applications for the elderly is a challenging task and will require approaches that are based on clearly defined models of context and system software architecture, as well as a systematic application of user-centered design principles. This chapter proposes a cognitive middleware for managing an elderly person's interaction with intelligent devices in a smart home. A key contribution of the chapter is the introduction of a cognitive mechanism -- that learns the habits, lifestyles, and preferences of an elderly person -- into the traditional middleware. It provides a homogeneous interface involving interactive context management capabilities for adapting application behaviors to the changing environments and interaction requirements of an elderly person in a smart home.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that includes a network of smart objects, which are embedded sensors, communicating using the Internet. One of the areas that are leading up to IoT is Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp). There are thus solutions such as frameworks, middlewares, and other development artifacts that come from the UbiComp community and can be used for IoT applications. On the other hand, the interaction evaluation of the applications can be more complex in IoT than in UbiComp systems, once we have two different perspectives: Human-Thing and Thing-Thing interactions. In this paper, based on the literature, our experience in these two domains, and case studies with Ubicomp and IoT applications, we discuss how we can benefit from the UbiComp move towards IoT, focusing on the main differences and similarities related to interaction evaluation. These differences open a set of questions that are also presented and discussed in this paper.",

Managing the large volume of data has been identified as one of the major challenges in IoT. To address this issue, Edge Computing envisions to process the data at the edge of the IoT network close to the embedded devices where the data is collected. This chapter aims to investigate the edge computing solutions for the smart grid. An edge computing model for the smart grid information processing, with a focus on smart home, is presented in this chapter.

abstract="Initially, building automation services were provided for larger buildings by means of a set of non-integrated subsystems. By the late 20th century, the concept had developed to include home automation through concepts such as the Digital Home, eHome or iHome based on smart systems and which supported the evolution of the traditional automation services to include entertainment and communication supported by home networks and residential gateways. The 21st century brought with it new paradigms such as ``ambient intelligence'' and ``ubiquitous computing''. In the case of ambient intelligence, this sets out to define a context in which people will be surrounded by intelligent and intuitive interfaces embedded in everyday objects which recognise and respond to their presence and which autonomously and intelligently adapt and respond to their needs while ubiquitous computing distributes processing power throughout the network of smart objects. The evolving constructs now encompass not only the home, but wider concepts such as those of the Smart City. The implementation of smart home and related technologies involves a number of systems issues for the short, medium and long terms such as the choice and future proofing of technologies, ethics and costs. The chapter therefore considers the development and application of smart home technologies and systems before looking at one particular area of application, that of eHealth and mHealth, in more detail.",

abstract="The scientific literature converges in indicating better life conditions for citizens as the smart city's main goal. To achieve this goal, cities leverage different technologies and especially ICT to modify urban infrastructures, public and private services and governance activities. However, smart programs often target the use and experimentation of innovative technologies, whilst citizens are considered as the passive addressees of technological programs. To verify whether smart projects really pursue citizens' well-being, an extensive empirical survey has been conducted. The research investigates 366 European smart city projects and extracts 42 ICT-enabled projects explicitly focusing on citizens. The analysis sheds light on the complex goal of citizens' well-being improvement in smart cities and on the most promising ICT solutions to impact urban life conditions. A special focus regards the use of IoT in smart projects addressing the citizens' well-being.",

abstract="The smart cities promise to offer innovative services to citizens in order to improve the level of life quality but currently, the integration among different ecosystems of data are still lacking. It is noteworthy that data, produced and consumed by public and private institutions, and citizens, may be a precious resource if abstraction and effectiveness are guaranteed in the interface mechanism between data-producers and data-consumers. This work proposes a coupling model, based on standards, technologies, and methodologies, able to make easy and effective the distribution, access, and use of data between services providers and citizens. The system architecture has been designed and developed by using the OSGi technology exploiting a support supplied by Docker, a platform able to ensure greater freedom in the modularization of software platforms oriented to micro-services. Furthermore, for higher levels, an approach based on the OneM2M standard has been adopted in order to obtain a middle layer useful to large-scale coordination of aspects related to the gathering, discovery, security and distribution of data and services. An use case has been defined and summarized in order to clearly show potential benefits of the proposed system for all stakeholders.",

abstract="Future cities will become a complex system of variable geometry, where ICT is the main driver of all connections, an intelligent tool that enables the dialogue between different systems, the bonding agent of the smart city. The man still remains the main actor, because he redesigns his habits, corrects his behaviors, shares ideas and solutions based on continuous feedback from the environment. The areas where there are large urban innovations are the field of mobility and energy and ICT of course. Approaches to intelligent cities implementations change, because they are powered by the aspects related to communication. The dimension of the smart districts appears to be the only convincing module, able to test systems, technologies and processes. The most interesting interface to investigate is the relationship between the new city module---infact the smart district---and the citizen, city-user and actor of all urban transformations/changes; the smart city becomes progressively more closer to people, more human.",

This paper is proposing a smart-home IoT infrastructure for the support and extension of the independent living of older adults in their living environments that responds also to real needs of caregivers and public authorities. The proposed infrastructure seamlessly utilizes health and monitoring devices for the provision of a safe environment for an elderly, the mitigation of frailty and the preservation of quality of life and autonomy. It also provides a mechanism for easy setup and testing of the installed equipment and a decision support system that offers advanced data analytics and visual analytics mechanisms to the formal and informal caregivers of the elderly for the efficient monitoring of their health and activity status.",

abstract="Smart home is a ubiquitous environment that aims to offer Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) to its occupants. The activity modeling framework proposed in this research work skillfully integrates ambient intelligence into the home environment by a collective process of activity recognition, abnormality detection, and decision making. Moreover, the activity modeling strategy employed in this research work efficiently models both the data and domain knowledge for activity recognition. The primary task in designing an activity recognition system involves the construction of activity model that represents occupant's Activities of Daily Living (ADL). To achieve activity recognition and abnormality detection competently, it is essential for the activity modeling strategy to consider the design challenges of uncertainty modeling, contextual modeling, composite modeling, activity diversity, and activity dynamics. The challenges of activity dynamics and data uncertainty are well addressed through data-driven approaches, whereas the challenges of activity granularity, contextual knowledge, and activity diversity are well addressed through knowledge-driven approaches. Therefore, activity recognition frameworks are proposed in this research work, where the first framework represents the activity model as a Markov Logic Network and the second framework represents the activity model as a probabilistic ontology. Each of these approaches offers both uncertainty and contextual modeling for activity recognition by integrating data-driven and knowledge-driven techniques. Moreover, this research proposes an assistive dementia care system through smart home that offers functional assistance to the dement occupant during critical situations without the help of caretaker.",

abstract="When ``Smart City'' is heard, it is most often interpreted as meaning a city that uses sensors, beacons, data, screens, mobile, and other technology tools. Sometimes it is interpreted to include city use of social media, search engines, browsing, and way-finding. It is usually intended as connoting communities that are prosperous, energy efficient, automated, environmentally friendly, and fun. The phrase is, perhaps, most often spoken by those who imagine, design, build, sell, and delight in digital and similar technologies. When some hear ``smart cities,'' however, they interpret it also---or instead---to mean equitable, just, safe, rich in work, education, and cultural opportunities, as well as clean, open, and inclusive of traditional and still relevant characterizations of a desirable city. This chapter discusses some of the challenges Austin, Texas believes it faces in retaining and improving its desirability. It is a sample of what Austin's government, residents, universities, and private sector partners are exploring in design, experimentation, and use of technologies so that Austin will be the kind of cutting-edge Smart City that includes the best of the traditional desirable city.",

There are huge investment opportunities associated with new implementation of climate smart cities in four distinct areas: framework, partnership, financial plan, and implementation arrangements. A platform based on these four elements could provide guidance on how climate smart urban development and infrastructure projects can be integrated into smart city planning processes. It could be built in a way that unlocks the value added of a digitalized urban ecosystem that helps address sources of climate change, impacts, and solution. On the whole, the fusion of information and communication technologies and ubiquitous urban information seems to be key to enhancing the role and value of a platform to build climate smart cities. The platform suggests that cost-effective public--private partnership will be key to the development and promotion of responsible smarter investment models.",

One of the important IoT-based applications is smart homes for healthcare, especially for elders. IoT-based smart homes enable elders' health to be properly monitored and taken care of. However, elders' privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication or other reasons. To demonstrate how serious this issue is, we introduce in this paper a Privacy Mining Approach (PMA) to mine privacy from smart homes by conducting a series of deductions and analyses on sensor datasets generated by smart homes. The experimental results demonstrate that PMA is able to deduce a global sensor topology for a smart home and disclose elders' privacy in terms of their house layouts.",

The assumed userAssumed userof an artefact shapes the affordances and limitations of the artefact; designers and developers strive to create a system that balances their understanding of the needs of the assumed user and the material limitations of the technology itself. Inspired by critical perspectives towards design, development and use of technological artefacts drawn from science and technology studies, this chapter will ask: who is the assumed user in the contemporary smart city? Illustrating this critical framework with examples from contemporary smart cities projects, this chapter will encourage the reader to reflect on the characteristics of the assumed user, and which users may have been unwittingly overlooked during design and development. It poses the question: which citizens' needs are not adequately addressed because they do not constitute the assumed user(s)?

abstract="Although things in the Internet of Things contain considerable amounts of software, developers of such software have no standardized means of maintaining, improving and sharing this software as they can do, e.g., with applications on a smart phone. This limitation can hamper user-driven innovation. In this paper we evaluate the usefulness of the ``app store'' metaphor as a means of sharing and deploying Internet of Things software among makers. We did a set of interviews and a questionnaire-based survey with a sample of makers in various maker communities. We used this data to extract requirements for an application store, using the common ``app store'' metaphor as a starting point. The app store concept was developed as a proof of concept implementation, and evaluated through feasibility evaluation and focus group evaluation methods. Our findings show that although the app store metaphor is familiar and easy to grasp, there are some fundamental challenges when adapting the metaphor: (1) The difficulty of supporting the diversity in the software and hardware vendor market, (2) The tension between context awareness and the need for pre-configuration and pre-packaging, and (3) usability challenges related to the number of devices and apps.",

This paper discusses requirements of the elderly people regarding skills in technologies and actual computer competency. The study, which is presented in this paper, brings findings from the research which was run by the authors on the local scene with a group of elderly people who attended computer courses within the frame of the `Internet for the Senior Citizens' intergeneration project. The project is annually organized by municipality and primary schools to improve computer literacy in the senior attendees. Researchers applied quantitative and qualitative methods. Results relating to the respondents' history in gaining computer skills showed that self-education and assistance from family members represent the main role in this field, nearly one third of attendees marked attendance of computer courses. As for skills, which the elderly would like to gain or practice, work with photography and files dominated. Most attendees were familiar with E-mail; they found learning to use Skype communication application more beneficial. The aim of the paper is to identify computer skills that the seniors attending the free courses would like have or develop in order to be able to participate partially or fully in Smart City without feeling `aside'. Research results were presented at the meeting of the directors and municipality representatives and are being incorporated into a next phase of the project with an updated design and content of the courses in a new learning environment.",

abstract="The increase in life expectancy and the consequent aging of the general population pose, nowadays, major challenges to modern societies. Most elderly people have the usual problems related to old age, like health chronic problems and sensory and cognitive impairments. Besides that, in today's modern societies, where families have less and less time to look after for their old relatives, the isolation of the elderly is a real concern and a very current problem, which is enhanced if the elders live alone. To solve or, at least, mitigate that problem, it was developed a smart home for elders that is presented and described in this paper. The developed assistive home system, which is based on available technology, can ensure the quality of life, safety and well-being of all older adults that want or desire to live in the comfort of their home, near to their friends and in their neighborhood, instead of living in elder care centers. The proposed solution can record and analyze the elders' daily routines in order to alert (e.g., e-mails or text messages) the family members and/or social agents (e.g., doctors and caregivers) whenever an unusual situation occurs or when the elder is in danger, provide real-time audio and video when necessary and some comfort features, such as, automatic lighting and temperature control. The relevant events are recorded and maintained in a cloud database, which can be accessed through a dedicated website or by an Internet of Things (IoT) Application Programming Interface (API). Although this type of solution/service is focused in the elderly population, anybody can use it. The developed solution provides comfort and safety to elders and, at the same time, an easier way of monitoring all important events.",

abstract="According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, Africa accounts for 10{\%} of the global visually impaired persons (VIPs). This visual impairment burden is exacerbated by the shortage of specialist medical human resources, orientation and mobility specialists, and high cost of assessing primary eye care services. These render the majority of VIPs to rely heavily on human-assisted guides and ineffective navigation aids for their daily routines and movements. A viable technological solution that can fill this void and meet these mobility needs is the Internet of Things (IoT). This chapter provides an assessment of smart IoT mobility solutions pertinent to the African context. Furthermore, the barriers to the realization of technology domestication as well as growth catalysts are examined. Lastly, this chapter proffers technical recommendations for sustainable domestication of smart IoT mobility solutions for VIPs in Africa.",

abstract="The technological advances in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have led to the generation of large amounts of data and the production of a large number of IoT platforms for their management. The abundance of raw data necessitates the use of data analytics in order to extract useful patterns for decision making. Current architectures for big data analytics in the IoT domain address the large volume and velocity of the produced data. However, they do not address the semantic heterogeneity in the data models used by diverse IoT platforms, which emerges when large-scale deployments, spanning across multiple deployment sites, are considered. This paper proposes an architecture for big data analytics in the context of large-scale IoT systems consisting of multiple IoT platforms. A Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) handles the interoperability among the data models of the individual platforms, using semantic mappings between them and a unified ontology. Data queries to the SIL and result collection is handled by a cloud-based data management layer, namely the Data Lake, along with storage of metadata needed by data analytics methods. Based on this infrastructure, web-based data analytics and visual analytics methods are used to analyze the collected data, while being agnostic of platform-specific details. The proposed architecture is developed in the context of healthcare provision for older people, although it can be applied to any IoT domain.",

abstract="Air pollution is one of the pressing issues faced not only by human race but also by Earth's vegetation. There are numerous findings regarding the effects of air pollution, for instance air pollutants playing a notorious role in inducing asthma and in formation of acid rain. Apart from regular activities done by government like creating acts, setting standards and regular inspection in industries to provide people with pollution free environment, various mobile apps like Air Quality India, SAFAR Air have been developed and disseminated to create environmental awareness. But even then, air pollution persists due to gases from vehicles on roads, Choloro Fluro Carbon from home appliances, Carbon Monoxide from incomplete combustion of fuels or gas, particulate matters from cigarette smoking, cooking etc. Individuals are affected by these air pollutants which are predominant in the air they breathe in. It is necessary to educate people on how to ameliorate the effects of air pollutants and control air pollution. In this paper, we have presented a framework that utilizes data from social networks and supervised machine learning algorithm, which will facilitate in taking an initial step towards a smart environment in smart cities. A part of our proposed application was tested with a group of people. These experiments showed better accuracy in classifying people according to the place where they spend most of their time in a day, and also received good responses from the people.",

abstract="In the past decade, research in Internet of Things and related technologies such as Ubiquitous Computing has fueled the development of Smart Spaces. Smart space does not just mean interconnection of different devices in our surroundings but an environment where the devices respond to human behavior and needs. To achieve this vision, services that are based on user's intents and their high-level goals should be provided. However, existing works mostly focus on providing context-awareness based services. In the past, smart space developers focused on providing technology-centric solutions but this approach failed to achieve wider market adoption of products as users either did not want the solutions at first place or they just could not understand how it worked. Therefore, researchers and smart space developers have now shifted towards the user-centric approach for developing smart spaces. It is non-trivial to develop user-centric smart spaces as developers have to consider factors such as user requirements, behavior etc. apart from usual technical challenges. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at the challenges in developing user-centric smart spaces for two different smart space scenarios: Smart Home and Smart Shopping. We give four user-centric criteria to compare these two smart spaces. At the end, we also provide some future research directions for developing Smart Spaces.",

abstract="This book chapter presents technological aspects regarding cognitive radio and communication technology for IoT (Internet of Things). In addition, health monitoring by cognitive radio for IoT is a technological challenge for communication because it involves the connection of electronic devices used for medical monitoring. For medical monitoring in the IoT context, it should consider the risks of electromagnetic interference between medical devices and aggregators (4G/5G cellular phone). The cellular phones emit EM radiation during the ringing, sending/receiving data and standby phase. In hospital are used for monitoring sophisticated devices, the inference can occur due to the medical staff and patients who useb cellular phone for personal commutation. Cognitive radio can solve the inference problem for electronic device networks connected by WLAN, through radio links. The IoT requirements, such as cognitive radio and 5G, are integrated parts of the Future Internet. For IoT cognitive radio the requirement is to reduce the channel inference with primary licensed users and alternative spectrum management (e.g. each unlicensed user will sense and access the spectrum when the spectrum is unoccupied by licensed users) to reduce the EMI. The scientific literature shows that there have been numerous concerns to model the cognitive radio using various algorithms, such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, hidden Markov model, genetic algorithms or classification algorithms. In our research we used cognitive radio modelling for medical devices by several algorithms, such as neural network and genetic algorithms.",

abstract="Smart cities is a concept that can be interpreted in many ways. One of them is to consider it as leveraging the wireless and wired Internet to streamline the operation of city-wide infrastructures to maximize their operational efficiencies and offer new services to the citizens. Many existing or ongoing smart city realizations follow this interpretation. Another more futuristic interpretation is to consider it as a large-scale context-sensitive computing infrastructure that hosts heterogeneous programs and enables the programs to interact with each other in a variety of different ways. In this chapter, we pursue such a futuristic interpretation. We are proposing a computing model for smart cities that brings together cloud computing, fogs, and mobiles to support intelligent context-sensitive computing. Our computing model has two components. The first component is a hierarchical abstract machine that spans the cloud, fogs, and devices, which can scale from a single device to many thousands of machines. The second component is an implicit learning module that observes selected data within the abstract machine to learn their characteristics. Because the implicit learning module can provide predictions based on the data in a context-sensitive manner, in certain scenarios applications can get by without explicitly incorporating machine learning into their design. In this chapter, we motivate the need for such an intelligent context-sensitive model, describe the components of the model, and present some early results.",

abstract="The increasing percentage of elderly people in the population (at least in Europe and North America) is part of a demographic change that will have an enormous impact on the society in the next few years. Thus, intelligent solutions that rely on the Internet of Things have been proposed in the literature, with the final goal to give remote support to elderly people at their home. Those solutions aim at monitoring activities and behaviors, and automatically send alarms in case of anomalies, putting in contact the end-user with her/his GP or alerting the emergency center or familiars, according to the specific needs. However, although the great deal of worldwide researches in the area of the Internet of Things and its early applications to healthcare and teleassistance, the technologies to apply it in real-world with the necessary dependability levels are far from being assessed. In this paper, we propose novel software engineering concepts that, by synthesizing existing proposals bringing in the lessons of agent-based computing and agent-oriented software engineering, can effectively support the systematic (and thus more dependable) development of Internet of Things applications.",

abstract="The Greater Pearl River Delta, more recently referred to as the Greater Bay Area (GBA), has and continues to rapidly develop into a significant and influential mega region in China, Southeast Asia and the world. The economic reforms of China and the Open Door Policy in 1978 transformed the primarily rural agricultural region into the highly populated, sprawling and urbanized high-tech value-added manufacturing region it is today. During this period, Hong Kong has played a significant role in the growth and development of the GBA with its more mature economy providing crucial support through its financial institutions, legal and professional services, and developed international trade and logistics hub, allowing businesses in the GBA to scale and reach global markets for their products. This in turn established economic, social, and political connections, collaboration and cooperation between Hong Kong and cities in the GBA such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Macao among others, as well as improvements in infrastructure and transportation networks that have enhanced regional accessibility and integration. Going forward however, Hong Kong's role and competitive advantage in the region is being threatened as other cities in the GBA continue to grow larger than Hong Kong both demographically and economically. As such, Hong Kong is at a time where it must both reposition itself within the region, especially as Hong Kong is gradually becoming more integrated with the rest of the GBA in Mainland China. This chapter will present an overview of the GBA region, assess its current development and regional integration, and review the future spatial development plans and regional cooperation initiatives of the cities in the GBA. Finally, a discussion of how Hong Kong can more effectively integrate itself with the rest of the GBA from economic, social and political levels is presented, and recommendations of key areas to address are suggested in order for Hong Kong and the GBA to further develop into a smarter, more sustainable, and liveable integrated mega region.",

The discussion is initially concerned with exploring the phenomena of Big Data and the Internet of Things. In essence, huge amounts of data are being generated on a daily basis and the issue is how to use this in a financially rewarding manner. An attempt to answer this question is made in the context of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and smart cities. The growth of M2M has been so rapid that, not uncommonly where technological advances are concerned, the various parties involved, and in particular mobile operators, have `gone with the flow' without any clear strategy about how to turn a profit and there is a lengthy analysis as to whether this is, or is not, going to happen. There is also an analysis of the development of smart cities and the role that mobile operators might play in their development.",

Caring for this burgeoning class has become a pressing challenge faced by many developed and emerging countries, including the US (the aging baby boomer) and China (the reverse 4-2-1 family pyramid due to one child policy). Despite failing health, most senior citizens prefer to live independently at home and hence the focus of current healthcare technologies has shifted from traditional clinical care to ``at-home'' care for the senior citizens. We propose to develop SilverLink, a system that is unique in its smart and connected technologies and will offer: (1) affordable and non-invasive home-based mobile health technologies for monitoring health-related motion and daily activities; (2) advanced mobile health analytics algorithms for fall detection, health status progression monitoring, and health anomaly detection and alert; and (3) a comprehensive health activity portal for reporting user activity and health status and for engaging family members.

abstract="The aging of the population in most developed countries has increased the need of proposing and adopting systems to monitor the behaviour of elder people with cognitive impairment. Home monitoring is particularly important for caregivers and relatives, who are in charge of these persons in potentially risky environments (e.g., the kitchen, the bathroom, the stairs, go out alone to the street, etc.), while they perform their household activities. On the other hand, the paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) allows the interconnection of everyday objects to implement sophisticate, yet simple-to-use, computer systems. In this paper, we analyse the existing IoT-based proposals to monitor elder people at home. Moreover, we propose a generic design of an IoT-based home monitoring system that allows caregivers, relatives and/or emergency services to be notified of potentially risky demeanours. Finally, some scenarios or situations are presented in order to better understand the proposal, and to validate its design to cover some common use cases.",

abstract="In the era when the market segment of Internet of Things (IoT) tops the chart in various business reports, it is apparently envisioned that the field of medicine expects to gain a large benefit from the explosion of wearables and internet-connected sensors that surround us to acquire and communicate unprecedented data on symptoms, medication, food intake, and daily-life activities impacting one's health and wellness. However, IoT-driven healthcare would have to overcome many barriers, such as: (1) There is an increasing demand for data storage on cloud servers where the analysis of the medical big data becomes increasingly complex; (2) The data, when communicated, are vulnerable to security and privacy issues; (3) The communication of the continuously collected data is not only costly but also energy hungry; (4) Operating and maintaining the sensors directly from the cloud servers are non-trial tasks. This book chapter defined Fog Computing in the context of medical IoT. Conceptually, Fog Computing is a service-oriented intermediate layer in IoT, providing the interfaces between the sensors and cloud servers for facilitating connectivity, data transfer, and queryable local database. The centerpiece of Fog computing is a low-power, intelligent, wireless, embedded computing node that carries out signal conditioning and data analytics on raw data collected from wearables or other medical sensors and offers efficient means to serve telehealth interventions. We implemented and tested an fog computing system using the Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that allows acquisition, computing, storage and communication of the various medical data such as pathological speech data of individuals with speech disorders, Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal for heart rate estimation, and Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based Q, R, S detection. The book chapter ends with experiments and results showing how fog computing could lessen the obstacles of existing cloud-driven medical IoT solutions and enhance the overall performance of the system in terms of computing intelligence, transmission, storage, configurable, and security. The case studies on various types of physiological data shows that the proposed Fog architecture could be used for signal enhancement, processing and analysis of various types of bio-signals.",

abstract="The high cost of healthcare services, the aging population and the increase of chronic disease are becoming a global concern. Several studies have indicated the need for strategies to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. A promising trend in healthcare is to move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric). Moreover, recent advances in microelectronics, wireless, sensing and information have boosted the advent of a revolutionary model involving systems and communication technology, enabling smarter ways to ``make things happen''. This new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has a broad applicability in several areas, including healthcare. The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of this technology-based healthcare approach, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve the wellness of the patients, as well as a better application of government financial resources. Based on this context, this paper aims to describe a review to comprehend the current state and future trends for healthcare applications based on IoT infrastructure, and also to find areas for further investigations.",

Data analysis shows that smart initiatives do not guarantee any economic growth, especially in a context of economic and financial crisis. A good digital infrastructure can facilitate the circulation of information and offer new opportunities to economy and society, but it is not enough. We have observed that the traditional, local social structure, funded on cooperation, may rather represent a very interesting starting point toward a new peer-to-peer organization of economy and society. Notwithstanding, traditional social structures badly need an infrastructural update in order to effectively enforce new socioeconomic strategies.",

abstract="The proportion of elderly people over 65 years old has rapidly increased, and social costs related to aging population problems have grown globally. The governments want to reduce these social costs through advanced technologies. The physician or medical center evaluates health conditions from the reports of elderly people. However, self-reports are often inaccurate, and sometimes reports by family or caregivers can be more accurate. To solve these problems, an evaluated objective method based on sensor data is needed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven smart home system that uses web technologies for connecting sensors and actuators. The proposed system provides a method of monitoring elderly people's daily activities using commercial sensors to register recognizable activities easily. In addition, it controls actuators in the home by using user-defined rules and shows a summary of elderly people's activities to monitor them.",

abstract="Data sensing and information processing are being fast embedded into the very fabric of the contemporary city in terms of its environments, systems, and processes, while wireless networks are proliferating in ways that are hard to imagine. This has been fueled by the new digital transition in ICT---enabled by an integration of various forms of pervasive computing---and justified by its potential to enhance the city operations, functions, services, and designs. Driving this transition predominantly are big data analytics and context-aware computing and their increasing amalgamation within a number of urban domains, especially when their functionality involves the same core enabling technologies, namely sensing devices, computing infrastructures, data processing platforms, and wireless communication networks. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with this new wave of urban ICT in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and thus ignore its potential in improving sustainability in the realm of smart sustainable cities. This endeavor is a first attempt to address the combination of big data analytics and context-aware computing in the realm of smart sustainable cities with respect to their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. This is an unexplored research area that has brought new and significant challenges for the development of smart sustainable cities. This chapter explores and reviews the real potential of big data analytics and context-aware computing for improving sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities. In doing so, it enumerates, describes, and discusses the state-of-the-art data-centric and context-aware applications pertaining to diverse urban systems and domains, as well as identifies the key challenges involved and sheds light on the open issues stemming from these challenges. We argue that combining big data analytics and context-aware computing could be leveraged in the advancement of urban sustainability, as their effects reinforce one another as to their efforts for transforming the processes operating and organizing urban life in this direction by employing and merging data-centric and context-aware applications to enhance, harness, and integrate urban systems as well as to facilitate collaboration and coupling among diverse urban domains. This study can serve as a benchmark for urban researchers, planners, and policymakers for the development of smart sustainable cities of the future in the context of big data analytics and context-aware computing.",

abstract="With the case of Delhi, the core argument of this chapter is that the Smart Cities Mission appears to present a disjuncture and a severance between the actually existing needs of Indian cities and citizens including the primary goal of creating wealth by embedding advanced technologies in the built environment without first addressing the basic city problems. Acceptance of New Delhi Municipal Council area as one of the selected 20 smart cities for central funding is puzzling because it further highlights the disjuncture between ground actuality and smart city policy utopia. In order to present these fissures, this chapter first presents five challenges of urbanization facing the city of Delhi. These are the challenges of infrastructure with a specific focus on sanitation, the challenge of mobility, the challenge of environment, the challenge of slums, and the challenge of governance. Separately, these challenges have been discussed, but this is the first attempt when urban development challenges are being discussed in the context of the Smart Cities Mission. These challenges are also selected because they form critical elements of the smart cities generally and the Smart Cities Mission in India particularly. Examining these challenges leads us to explore whether the smart cities, as conceived and currently being built by Indian and global corporate builders, could face up to the challenges presented by the Indian urbanization. The case of Delhi is appropriate within the smart city discourse because it is counted among the top performing metropolitan cities of the country. Core argument of the chapter is that narrowing down the disjuncture between experienced city realities and policy perceptions is useful even for economic growth, the prime public policy goal at the present moment.",

abstract="Providing easy and convenient access to government services when and where required is the hallmark of a Smart City. In an age of smartphones and User Experience, this is where the rubber meets the road. Using the right tools, technology and deployment channels to deliver government services and foster civic engagement through mobile devices is becoming a criterion to evaluate the degree of smartness and getting star rated. This is the virtual equivalent of a visitor chair, service desk, counter, suggestion box, officer's face, voice and the warmth of service delivery. Welcome to the era of 24x7 government services anytime, anywhere at your convenience! M-Governance signifies the delivery of services via mobile communication devices, i.e. a tool and method that facilitates communication and transaction between Government to Government (G2G), Government to Employee (G2E), Government to Business (G2B) and Government to Citizen (G2C) with agility and ubiquity. With one in five people having smartphones in the world today and this figure doubling every year, the delivery of services on smartphones is fast becoming a norm. For those smartphone have-nots, M-Governance services have to be extended by engaging middle tire enablers, as has been the case with egovernance services. This chapter aims to describe GPS (Global Positioning System) and NFC (Near Field Communication) technologies that are built-in smartphones and to explore their potential applications in M-Governance. Embedding GPS technology on smartphones has made `Location' easy to know and measure, just how wrist watch has made knowing and measuring `time' easy. Today, GPS technology is used by a common man without even knowing its definition and thanks to web mapping technologies that gives context to a GPS location. The GPS technology section will explore Location centric M-Governance applications that are currently used and explore new applications. NFC Technology is a close sibling of GPS where by `Proof of Presence' Is used to manage mobile work forces of government in offering government services and to monitor contractors adhering to service provisions. The NFC technology section will focus on various NFC applications on Government to Employees and contractors.",

Due to the increasing number of IoT connected devices, the amount of generated data is increasing too. Processing huge amounts of data is complex due to the continuously running situation recognition algorithms. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an approach for optimizing the usage of situation recognition algorithms in Internet of Things domains. The key idea of our approach is to select important data, based on situation recognition purposes, and to execute the situation recognition algorithms after all relevant data have been collected. The main advantage of our approach is that situation recognition algorithms will not be executed each time new data is received, thus allowing the reduction of the situation recognition algorithms execution frequency and saving computational resources.",

However, the security issues arising from the scale of connectivity and heterogeneity of resources in IoT make it a hot target for attackers, where centralized security solutions fall short. The vulnerabilities in providing proper device authentication and data integrity in IoT networks have been shown to introduce devastating effects. This calls for designing a data security architecture for IoT, which can accurately authenticate devices by anyone in the network in a decentralized manner and prevent unauthorized modification of the stored data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach for IoT systems that introduces transparency and tamper-resistance into data storage and retrieval in IoT networks.

abstract="After giving a brief overview of the relevance and value of deploying automatic audio event recognition (AER) in the smart home market, this chapter reviews three aspects of the productization of AER which are important to consider when developing pathways to impact between fundamental research and ``real-world'' applicative outlets. In the first section, it is shown that applications introduce a variety of practical constraints which elicit new research topics in the field: clarifying the definition of sound events, thus suggesting interest for the explicit modeling of temporal patterns and interruption; running and evaluating AER in 24/7 sound detection setups, which suggests to recast the problem as open-set recognition; and running AER applications on consumer devices with limited audio quality and computational power, thus triggering interest for scalability and robustness. The second section explores the definition of user experience for AER. After reporting field observations about the ways in which system errors affect user experience, it is proposed to introduce opinion scoring into AER evaluation methodology. Then, the link between standard AER performance metrics and subjective user experience metrics is being explored, and attention is being drawn to the fact that F-score metrics actually mash up the objective evaluation of acoustic discrimination with the subjective choice of an application-dependent operation point. Solutions to the separation of discrimination and calibration in system evaluation are introduced, thus allowing the more explicit separation of acoustic modeling optimization from that of application-dependent user experience. Finally, the last section analyses the ethical and legal issues involved in deploying AER systems which are ``listening'' at all times into the users' private space. A review of the key notions underpinning European data and privacy protection laws, questioning if and when these apply to audio data, suggests a set of guidelines which summarize into empowering users to consent by fully informing them about the use of their data, as well as taking reasonable information security measures to protect users' personal data.",

However, smart city are a jeopardized phenomenon, and smart cities show heterogeneous profiles. Moreover, also the scientific researches lack of a shared definition of smart city; and smart city and digital city are often confused each other owing the large use of ICT in both of them. In this chapter, the smart city concept is analyzed, considering two main aspects: the strategic vision of a smart city and its benefits. A smart city strategic vision is of paramount importance for effectively driving the local policies in implementing smart initiatives pursuing shared goals. Smart city benefits are often declared, but not measured; to better define smart city performance is indispensable for realizing better outcome for citizens and other stakeholders.",

abstract="This chapter describes the smart city example from the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. Pittsburgh is a typical city in the rust belt of America that faced decline and shrinkage due to de-industrialization and globalization forces. The economic transformation of Pittsburgh into a post-industrial regime has brought its own set of unique challenges and represent a unique perspective of urban and regional planning approaches that met with varying degrees of success. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the smart city approaches in the context of a Shrinking City that have been shaped by forces of industrial decline, population and job loss, abundance of derelict industrial sites, suburban exodus and racial conflicts, along with shared notions of fighting back to comeback and succeed in the New Economy. After witnessing a prolonged state of industrial and economic decline since the 1980s, Pittsburgh had no choice but adopt planning strategies that would restructure its economy, and transform its large-scale abandoned brownfield sites to create places of vibrant economy and community. Pittsburgh's proactive policies to involve local communities in reusing old and vacant lands for economic transformation and urban greening, as well as using green infrastructure for storm water management and improving the quality of its waterways, resulted in many success stories throughout the region. Thus, our study of Smart City strategies in Pittsburgh focuses on the successes and failures of economic transformation, brownfield redevelopment and urban greening. While it is in the process of coming back, the region still faces several challenges, such as a large number of vacant and distressed lands, aging population and infrastructure, which needs to be addressed in the coming decades.",

It uses encrypted QR-tag values to compare them to original values. Three-layers have been proposed for this verification procedure to attain security objectives. The first layer implements a comparison to preserve the system integrated. In the second layer, original values are stored in offline database storage to disable any access caused by threats; to preserve it available. The third one frequently generates an authenticated QR tag using 1-session private key to prevent both information leakage and an unauthorized access if the key was deduced; to keep it confidential. The SVA aims to increase the system privacy. It is evaluated in terms of security factors. Results confirm that it is faster than other competitive techniques. Additionally, results have discussed SVA's robustness against unauthorized access's attempts and brute force attack.",

abstract="Although we have been able to develop a list of indicators that can measure the ``smartness of a city'', the vision for each city must be different. It has to be created in a dialog with the local community, and take into consideration cultural and socio-economic context, including cultural traditions, local definition of well being, and governance style. The future of smart cities depends on whether we can educate a new generation of governmental, corporate, and community leaders who will know how to utilize information technology in implementation of said vision. It is important though to consider the fact that just equipping the schools with advanced technology is not enough. As the parameters for smart learning environment will be different for Beijing then for a small city in rural China, we need to build smart schools, with the model of such a school varying for different locations, is necessary. In this chapter we review some opinions on the role of multicultural perspectives on smart cities and smart learning expressed by scientists, government officials teachers, and students. This brief analysis may allow the reader not only to better understand the specificity of Chinese perspective on these concepts, but also the need of teachers training focused on cultural diversity, sustainable development and the role of ICT in governance of the school and smart city.",

abstract="Indoor air quality parameters are extremely important to create a productive and healthy indoor environment however in many cases the air quality parameters are very different from those defined as healthy values. Considering that we spend about 90{\%} of our lives indoors, it is extremely important to monitor the indoor air quality in real time to detect problems in the quality of air and plan interventions in the building, or in the ventilation systems in order to improve air quality. This paper aims to present a solution for indoor air quality monitoring based in Internet of Things Architecture (IoT). This solution is composed by a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and a web and smartphone compatibility for data consulting. This system, denominated by iAQ Wi-Fi, is based on open-source technologies. It is a totality Wi-Fi system, with several advantages compared to existing systems, such as its modularity, scalability, low cost and easy installation. This system performs real-time data collection that is stored in a ThingSpeak platform. The system has smartphone compatibility which allow easier access to data in real time. In this application, the user can check the latest data collected by the system and access to the history of the air quality parameters in graphical representation. iAQ Wi-Fi uses a open-source Arduino UNO as processing unit, a ESP8266 for Wi-Fi 2.4 GHZ as communication unit and incorporates an temperature and humidity sensor, a CO2 sensor, a dust sensor and a digital light sensor as sensing unit.",

Acceptability of smart homes relies on the users' perceptions towards its benefits and their concerns related to monitoring and data sharing. Within this study, an online survey with 234 participants has been conducted to understand the attitudes and perceptions of future smart home users, followed by detailed analysis of their responses. In general, the users agree that the smart home technology would improve the quality of life to a greater extent and enhance the safety and security of residents. On the contrary, they raise several concerns such as the increased dependence on technology and the monitoring of private activities, which may be seen as perceived drawbacks. The obtained results show that the older adults (ages from 36 to 70 years) are more open to monitoring and sharing data especially if it useful for their doctors and caregivers while the young adults (ages up to 35 years) are somewhat reluctant to share information.",

abstract="The number of internet-connected devices (Internet of Things, IoT) is growing at an unstoppable rate. Many manufacturers have developed specific protocols that are usually closed and do not follow any standard, hindering the interconnection and coordination of devices from different manufactures. This entails a greater effort from users to coordinate some devices and the loss of the benefits provided by this paradigm. Some works are proposing different techniques to reduce this barrier and avoid the vendor lock-in issue. Nevertheless, this interconnection should also depends on the context. IoT devices must adapt their behavior according to the people's preferences around them. In this paper, we propose a system that allows to identify a dynamic interconnection of IoT devices arising from changing situations to help elderly people with their daily tasks and improve their quality of life. Our work allows us to make this interconnection context dependent, creating a collaborative environment between people and devices. Further, in a world with an accelerated population aging, there is an increasing interest on developing solutions for the elderly living assistance through IoT systems.",

By examining a survey where experts rate factors and risks in smart city development, this paper sheds light to an array of vulnerabilities that may be overlooked by public managers and executives and may compromise their smart cities goals. Expanding on literature, findings suggest the most critical smart city development factors are technological (infrastructure development, open data services, availability of information resources), organizational (clear KPIs, coordination procedures, strategic planning, creating business environment, transparency in decision-making) and social ones (preferences in getting e-services, human capital growth). Markedly, experts understood the most serious risks involve technological and social adaption. The results achieved could be of interest for counting risk factors in the emerging smart cities.",

abstract="Senior care has become one of the pressing societal challenges faced by many developed and emerging countries, including the US (the aging baby boomer) and China (the reverse 4-2-1 family pyramid due to one child policy). Despite failing health, most senior citizens prefer to live independently at home and hence the focus of current healthcare technologies have shifted from traditional clinical care to ``at-home'' care for the senior citizens. We propose to develop SilverLink, a system that is unique in its smart and connected technologies and will offer: (1) affordable and non-invasive home-based mobile health technologies for monitoring health-related motion and daily activities; (2) advanced mobile health analytics algorithms for fall detection, health status progression monitoring, and patient health anomaly detection and alert; and (3) a comprehensive patient health activity portal for reporting user activity and health status and for engaging with family members. This system will initially be launched in the US, in China and in Taiwan and will aim to overcome the limitations of existing home-care solutions.",

abstract="Issues for developing Smart City E-Governance in India are unique. Two basic issues are the levels of E-Governance Infrastructure in position, namely information and communication technology (ICT) and relative ability of population subgroups to access the E-Governance infrastructure. There has not been uniform social development of urban and rural population and also population subgroups such as male and female, scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), Muslims and non-Muslims in India. Therefore uniform environment of developing Smart City E-Governance does not exist. These target groups require differing policy set to make their access to Smart E-Governance possible. This partitioning of subgroups into different levels of accessibility to Smart E-Governance is the major issues of Smart E-Governance in India. There has been rapid development in ICT such as telephones, mobiles and Internet in India in absolute terms but when it is converted to percentage figures it gives very negative impression doubting the possibility of Smart City E-Governance in India. Also, E-Government survey conducted by United Nations in 2012 places India in the lowest quartile. However recent development of E-Commerce in India gives considerable hopes for E-Governance. E-Commerce and E-Governance shares the same ecosystem but E-Commerce has shown very rapid development and GDP generated can even surpass health and education sector in India. These developments are mainly generated by potential smart cities in India. This gives positive assurance that carefully selected about 31 mega cities, million pilus cities in India and can be developed for Smart City E-Governance. Other towns from about 8,000 census towns have to wait to overcome their population-related access to Smart City E-Governance. This concluding chapter in the last part highlights the further reaches of E-Governance discussed in all chapters of the book as part of its future.",

abstract="The modern form of urbanization began around early nineteenth century in developed countries. Early cities of world New York, Boston and Philadelphia were the largest in 1790. At this stage only 3{\%} of global population lived in cities. By 2000 the mega cities (cities with 10 million Population) rose to sixteen and the number is expected to reach around 27 by 2025. Massive urbanization creates opportunities on one hand and poses challenges on the other hand. The cities which are magnets for small and medium town population slowly steadily face resource and infrastructure crunch. The scarcity of resources coupled with environmental pollution chokes the urban environment and makes the cities unhealthy and unsustainable. According to Word Urbanisation Prospects, United Nations by 2050, nearly 70{\%} of the world's population would live in cities and there would be many cities with more than 10 million population. India too is experiencing the upsurge of population especially in urban areas. To accommodate and resolve the problems associated with rapid urbanization, the Government of India has planned to build hundred new Smart cities.  Building Smart cities in India is challenging yet imperative solution for managing massive urbanization and optimizing resource availability and distribution processes.",

This paper examines concepts and perceptions of city officials from six ``smart'' cities, Boston, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro. Their ``smart'' efforts, gathered through interviews and secondary sources, are analyzed against four theories of ``smart'' cities; (a) ``smart machines'' and informated organizations, (b) partnerships and collaboration, (c) learning and adaptation, and (d) investing for the future. The findings show that instead of converging toward a single definition of being ``smart'', the cities have taken different approaches in planning and implementation, and adopt different combinations of elements from the theories. The cities' experiences and elements of being ``smart'' are distilled and presented as learning points and pathways for other cities.",

abstract="This chapter proposes a novel strategic framework and computationally intelligent model to measure possible vulnerabilities for security context in e-health. In order to keep track of security of e-health paradigm, the chapter conceives a bio-inspired model comprising the collective intelligence of social insects e.g. ant colony. Ant colony optimization is a computationally intelligent meta-heuristics, which takes care-off the different random and uncertain behavior of different sensors deployed towards e-health measures. The essential input is provided from interconnected wireless sensors under Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and intelligent social insects that could sense the possibility of threats for a patient moving in different physical locations during his medical diagnosis. Social insect ants can sense and communicate through a chemical, known as pheromone, remotely from their nest towards collection of food. The intensity of pheromone measured for different interconnected graphs of e-health could lead to a consolidated algorithm and finally the differences of intensities can infer on the affected or safe path for propagation of medical information. Modelling the pheromone dynamics can be a precise measure to quantify the different e-health security issues like Sinkhole threat or sybil attack under IoT environment. The proposed pheromone alert is presented and compared statistically in terms of precision to identify the classification of possible vulnerabilities.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a hot topic in the research field recently. Smart home, which provides comfortable living environment to users with advanced technologies, is an important application field in IoT. With a large number of people who live remotely from family members, smart homes should provide not only convenient and comfortable services in a single house, but also mutual communication services to enhance interaction between family members. Unlike usual communication methods such as phone call, email, and chatting tools with human intentions, we propose a remote mutual situation-aware model between smart homes to let users contact with other family members in an unintended way. A prototype system has been implemented by detecting entrance and exit behaviors in smart homes. Through a feasibility confirmation evaluation of the system, the system worked well and could correctly reflect the entrance and exit behaviors in a remote smart home.",

In 1900, only 13{\%} of the world's population lived in the city, and by 2008 the proportion reached 50{\%} for the first time. By the end of 2011, the urban population in China reached 691 million, accounting for 51.27{\%} of the total population, and the urbanization rate of China exceeded 50{\%} historically. This indicates that China and the world have officially entered the urban society. Massive urbanization creates opportunities on one hand and poses challenges on the other hand. The extensive development mode coupled with the uneven distribution of resources threatens urban ecosystem and makes the cities unsustainable. Meanwhile, a new revolution of new information communication technologies represented by Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and next generation mobile communication technology has brought new perspectives and technical bases for the solution of traditional urban problems. In November 2008, IBM released the theme report of Smarter Planet: the Next Generation of Leaders Agenda in New York. Since then, the ``smart city'' concept was accepted gradually. The development of intelligent city was considered to help promoting the sustainable development of economy, society and environment, resource coordination in the city, alleviating the ``big city disease'', improving the quality of urbanization, so it quickly became an important fulcrum to meet the challenges of the city in the world.",

This analysis can let us find out strong and weak points of Caceres as a smart city. The methodology of this study is based on a descriptive analysis of initiatives that have been carried out in each of these cities based on eight factors used for an elaboration of the International Data Corporation ranking. The analysis exposes that Caceres, despite standing out due to its project of Jetty Building or Smart Water Caceres, still shows several weak points in other areas, as smart mobility, smart services or smart information and communications technologies. A SWOT analysis has been done to end the study; it shows the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that have helped us to carry out a number of suggestions and recommendations that can help Caceres to progress as a smart city.",

In this evolution, the role and interests of the current and future activities of all sectors---government, public and citizen is undergoing an immense transformation. The transformation is rapid and continuous for many cities of the world and Dubai is one such city which is progressing steadily in the sector of online activities to achieve the greater goals of E-democracy. Innovation has played a major role in the region. With immense support from the ruler and his extremely progressive vision, Dubai residents has shown readiness and activeness that has supported government smart strategies and in return, the government took responsibility by continuously creating jobs for the citizens. This chapter is a presentation of a framework which shows how UAE and Dubai has developed a strategy in many sectors including the field of non- oil sectors where smart technologies and innovations of government and resident's collaborative approach has resulted in the strong bonding between the public and private sector and eventually became responsible in the growth of the country. The chapter illustrates the potential role of government in introducing smart technologies and letting the residents enable the transformation of traditional identities into state of the art-digital identities. Further, the chapter highlights the impact of oil prices and the government's renewable energy initiatives to keep the pace of development unaffected and transform the country into a green country through its effective policies and world class project development by the year 2030 using underline strong bonding of government and its people- setting a unique feature of democracy.",

abstract="Today's societies are facing great challenges in transforming living environments in a way better serving people's demands of the future. A key point in this transformation is reinventing cities as smart cities, where the core services are integrated in a way that ensures a high quality of life while minimizing the usage of resources [Smart cities in Europe. Serie Research Memoranda 0048, VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Econometrics 1]. Setting up smart cities resp. transforming cities to smart cities includes the development of smart transport systems as a main service all other services rely on. Thinking about current mega trends like Individualization of Products (Mass Customization) in so called Industry grid also known as Industry 4.0 [Umsetzungsempfehlungen f{\"u}r das Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4.0 2] (Industrie 4.0 describes the industry in the 4th industrial revolution to customized mass production after mechanization, mass production, digitalization [Map `n' tag. Thinking highways 3]), Personalized Medicine or the need of better support for disabled and older people in an aging society, the interconnection of involved bodies is a premise. In virtual world this means integration of data networks and ICTs in the physical world this means establishing individual and personalized transport services that cover individual mobility and individual distribution of goods. To ensure the best utilization of infrastructure while having less employable people in an aging society a high grade of automation and information integration is needed. We call this a smart transport system as the next step in development of today's intelligent transport systems (ITS) and propose establishing this ITS of the future as an autonomic system to meet all the different requirements and ensure a high reliability of the overall system. Reliability is essential since most other services of the living environment smart city, will rely on transport systems. This chapter gives an overview on state of research based on current literature and recent publications of the authors (see references) and focus on the ICT system needed to manage transportation the autonomic transport management system.",

abstract="The percentage of the world's population aged over 65 is growing at unprecedented rates. Many countries face the challenge of supporting an aging population despite increasing healthcare costs, and an insufficient number of caregivers. Emerging technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), can help. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are a good indicator of healthy aging and provide a baseline for detecting an elder's changes in physical and cognitive state. Monitoring and accurately classifying elders' activities helps prevent and mitigate some common risks faced by elders when they age-in-place. In our study, we partnered with a senior care provider to add sensors to five apartments in an independent living facility and provided the requisite 24/7 monitoring. Ambient sensors were deployed in each of the apartments and collected high-density IoT sensor data for six months for each of the study participants, who were all over the age of 70. While we successfully created a model to classify ADLs through the recognition and observation of patterns based on high-density ambient sensor placement, sensor data and semantics, and characteristics of activities, we discovered challenges in capturing every ADL for each participant. Often, the ADLs captured for each participant offered unique and personalized indicators of healthy aging. This paper explores the challenges of deploying consumer-grade, IoT, sensors, and the application of AI technology to learn and model elders' ADLs. We also share results of our exploration to classify ADLs in the data using manual crowd-sourcing, rule-based reasoning and machine learned analytics.",

Advancements in ubiquitous computing applications in combination with the use of sophisticated intelligent sensor networks may provide a basis for help. Whilst the smart health concept has much potential to support the concept of the emerging P4-medicine (preventive, participatory, predictive, and personalized), such high-tech medicine produces large amounts of high-dimensional, weakly-structured data sets and massive amounts of unstructured information. All these technological approaches along with ``big data'' are turning the medical sciences into a data-intensive science. To keep pace with the growing amounts of complex data, smart hospital approaches are a commandment of the future, necessitating context aware computing along with advanced interaction paradigms in new physical-digital ecosystems. In such a system the medical doctors are supported by their smart mobile medical assistants on managing their floods of data semi-automatically by following the human-in-the-loop concept. At the same time patients are supported by their health assistants to facilitate a healthier life, wellness and wellbeing.",

Successful cities create a peaceful and secure environment for investment and encourage high human capital development through well-educated and healthy citizens; such cities report lower levels of inequalities and poverty. Advances in information and communication technologies in the past few decades have enabled globalization, which is itself associated with urban growth and development. Recent studies have, however, also noted that globalization is making cities vulnerable in new ways, especially by opening them up to destructive networks that undermine security and development. Therefore, smart cities must continuously make efforts to raise the competencies and quality of its citizens and thereby improving its competitiveness, increasing innovations and overcoming other challenges such as unemployment, insecurity and lawlessness. This chapter highlights the enormous efforts that Nairobi city has made in addressing and improving its safety and the social capital of its citizens through investments in technological advancements in health, education and security services as part of its developmental pathway to achieving a smart city status.

abstract="We propose a general framework for systems of the Internet of Things based on ideas of reliability trust, transaction gain, and risk. The major contribution of this work is the integration of the reliability trust estimated at the perception layer and risk estimation based on global control information provided by the cloud layer. We propose establishing a decision-making process on a random variable-based gain-loss model and methods of choice under risk. The proposed approach is general -- it can be used for a wide range of trust-based decisions undertaken in the perception layer, such as routing, sensor selection, data aggregation, intrusion detection, and others.",

abstract="As civilization plunged into software and eventually grew coated over generations, society inevitably ran to the ``every body'' can use age. At that stage of development, software drew closer to mankind. Industries called for software applications to handle their data, leading to an elephantine production of database management systems in the 1970s. Later in the 80s, following the advancement in hardware, software amplified its scope into a network of disciplines such agriculture where it made possible outcome prediction and the medical sector, where software applications monitored medical equipment. Meanwhile software applications engulfed the entertainment market with virtual and augmented reality, the Internet and Mobile applications furnished completeness of services. As of emerging industries involving Space, Scientific Exploration, New energy, Internet of Things and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle areas, software applications provided ways of accelerated explorations and analysis, together with advanced data transformation and interpretation. Currently as we are writing this book, a lot of software simulation and exploration is taking place in the software industry. They are carried out in an attempt to visualize future opportunities. As mankind constantly receives threads from its environment and nature, it has been endlessly seeking for the next station. From these examples of software application, readers will have a better understanding of software culture. This chapter discusses the relationship between software applications and software culture from two aspects: software applications in traditional and emerging industries.",

But now smart home products are still at start-up period of product's development life cycle. What functions can attract consumption and are necessary? What functions are necessary but have no attraction? These function demands of users are not understood thoroughly. So far, there is no much study to differentiate varieties of function demands of smart home. In addition, their preference for requirements of smart home is different as different groups are different in consumption psychology and consumption behavior. For example, the consumption behavior of middle-aged group is rather conservative and youth group is active in thinking and likes to buy some new products and try new life. Therefore how to position the development of relative smart home products according to different target groups is an important subject needed to think.",

Individuals use social networks for sharing materials, photos or videos, communication or posting messages. Very important is also a topic of social isolation that will be discussed in the article. The results of the statistics show that the share of seniors in the Czech Republic has an increasing trend. The utilization of social networks by elderly people has in the Czech Republic also increasing trend except for the second quarter of the 2015 year when a slight decrease was recorded. In comparison with other countries from Visegrad group and the EU 28 the Czech Republic reached lower results in the utilization of social networks. In two evaluated criteria from three the Czech Republic was comparable to Poland. The age groups show that with increasing age there is a declining trend for the use of social networks. 10.1{\%} of the population from 55 to 64 years and 3.3{\%} of the population over 65 use social networks in the second quarter of 2015.

abstract="The challenge of an aging population requires innovative approaches to meet the needs of increasing numbers of older people within society (Sixsmith {\&} Sixsmith, 2008). In particular, there is a need to move from a health and social agenda that emphasizes dependency to one that promotes active aging and creates supportive environments to enable healthy aging in the settings where older people live (Sixsmith et al., 2010). Emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as pervasive computing and ubiquitous computing, have considerable potential for enhancing the lives of many older people throughout the world and helping them to age in place (Sixsmith {\&} Sixsmith, 2008). Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) refers to ICT systems, products, and services that integrate sensors, actuators, smart interfaces, artificial intelligence, and communications networks to provide more supportive environments for frail and disabled older people (Mokhtari, Khalil, Bauchet, Zhang, {\&} Nugent, 2009; van den Broek, Cavallo, {\&} Wehrmann, 2010). AAL has been an important emerging area of research over recent years involving collaboration between domain experts (health sciences, rehabilitation, gerontology, and social sciences) and technical experts (engineering, computing science, robotics). Research and development within AAL has aimed to develop applications and systems to facilitate independence (van den Broek et al., 2010), such as activity monitoring to detect potential emergencies, reminder devices for supporting and encouraging mobility and activities of daily living, monitoring activity patterns as indicators of change in cognitive and physical status, and smart interfaces to help people control their everyday environment. The European research project SOPRANO (Service-oriented Programmable Smart Environments for Older Europeans) developed supportive environments for older people based on the concept of AAL.",

This chapter comprehensively presents the three challenges of urbanization facing Indian cities. These are the challenges of infrastructure with a specific focus on sanitation, the challenges of environment, and the challenges of governance. Separately, these challenges have been discussed but this is the first attempt when urban development challenges are being discussed in the context of the Smart Cities Mission.

abstract="Urban growth in developing and developed countries is changing our lives, and causing explosive growth of data			generation in an interconnected world. Moreover, billions of new relationships between all parts of our environment will			be created. Policy makers will face high complexity and will have to handle these challenges under fast changing and			highly dynamic circumstances. Nowadays, a city can be represented as a ``living body'' with networks as the nervous			system, administrative authorities as the brain, transportation systems as the circulatory system, and further			stakeholders as organs. Socio‐technical aspects of a Smart City should be cultivated and treated in the most efficient			way for a better city development. Rationalization in all areas of urban life is a main driver of			smartness. Investigation of the quality of life in cities is a kind of rational consideration of prevalent living			conditions. Relationships between quality of life, residents' needs and available services are important for			resident‐centered design of a Smart City. City On‐Demand is a new approach that is characterized by reliable and user			friendly Smart Services that probably do not exist before request and occur in real‐time upon receipt of the			request. Citizens' lives will be improved through an efficient use of customized services.

abstract="The surge of smart city technology, thinking, publications and consultancy offerings is significant. This implies there is something seriously developing. But to what extent is this a new development? In this paper the case will be made that urban design has always had to include new technologies and the smart city movement is just another wave of technology that demands inclusion in urban design practice. Nevertheless, city designers and policy makers should make use of the new possibilities on offering. Interactive urban environments could support healthy living, while smart and responsive regulators could minimize our energy use, and anticipative traffic management could help minimising congestion. Further to this, crowd-sensing could smoothen urban mobility and new forms of 3d-printing may re-use and reduce waste. The core of all new technological potential however is still to service people and to make life for urban citizens better. How could people in search for a convenient life be better serviced? Many of them want to have a nice house, a clean, safe and healthy environment, access to resources such as clean water, renewable energy and healthy food, a resilient place that is not vulnerable for all kinds of climate impacts and possibly some room for contemplation. With Maslow's ladder in mind, achieving this not only depends on the availability and use of technology, rather a well-designed and integrated urban plan is asked for. Meeting the needs of contemporary urban citizens must be served by what urban design is supposed to deliver, only now with current available technologies in the back pocket. The paper emphasises how to design the convenient city by making use of the available technology, but it also takes a stand on the relativity of the current hype of smart cities.",

abstract="The Internet of Things is paving the way for the transition into the fourth industrial revolution with the mad rush of connecting physical devices and systems to the internet. IoT is a promising technology to drive the agricultural industry, which is the backbone for sustainable development especially in developing countries like those in Africa that are experiencing rapid population growth, stressed natural resources, reduced agricultural productivity due to climate change, and massive food wastage. In this paper, we assessed challenges in the adoption of IoT in developing countries in agriculture. We propose a cost effective, energy efficient, secure, reliable and heterogeneous (independent of the IoT protocol) three layer architecture for IoT driven agriculture. The first layer consists of IoT devices and it is made up of IoT driven agriculture systems such as smart poultry, smart irrigation, theft detection, pest detection, crop monitoring, food preservation, and food supply chain systems. The IoT devices are connected to the gateways by low power LoRaWAN network. The gateways and local processing servers co-located with the gateways create the second layer. The cloud layer is the third layer, which exploits the open source FIWARE platform to provide a set of public and free-to-use API specifications that come along with open source reference implementations.",

abstract="Urban development initiatives in India are largely shaped by a `patchwork of programmers' launched periodically by the Government of India. Recently, the Indian government has launched multiple urban transformation programmes aiming at smart city development, urban renewal, and heritage development. But, India's urban policy interventions lacks effective mechanisms for measuring the impact of such programmes over time. Indicator systems can provide insight into local urban challenges and issues and offer a basis for measuring urban progress as a result of public investments. Although there are multiple global indicator facilities available for adoption, considerable challenges remain in selecting an appropriate set of indicators for local conditions. With Indian urbanisation intensifying and an accompanying proliferation of urban development programmes, there is an increasing need for a set of indicators suited to local context. A local approach can objectively measure the existing performance of Indian cities vis-a-vis quality of life and sustainability, and can evaluate the outcome and benefits of new local urban development programmes as they are implemented. To address this emerging need, this research aims to provide a bridge between local urban performance and the capacity to meet local and global standards. By the application of factor analysis (Principal Component Analysis) on 59 indicators chosen from various urban sectors, this study attempts to derive the most significant factors to measure the performance of 98 Indian cities and assess their potential to become sustainable smart cities. The study enhances the selection and development of policies by city makers. It also establishes an approach to develop urban typologies for different Indian cities. Such a categorisation makes the bewildering range of Indian cities and their challenges easier to comprehend and address.",

abstract="The global population is moving toward an ageing population. Many countries are improving their technology to create smart cities suitable for the elderly. With the development of smart devices, people can make their life more convenient and can use phone APP to help the older with medical or health management. With the degeneration of their body, their sense of touch decreases, which in turn affects their feelings of haptic feedback for smart devices. Therefore, the study is aim to measure haptic feedback differences between elderly and young people, and to provide the manufacturers of mobile devices development as a basis for elderly have a good haptic feedback experience and improve the quality of use. The study was divided into two phases, a total of 58 participants recruited, of whom 27 people were 18 to 50 years old and 31 people over the age of 50, and through comparing haptic vibration feedback intensity by different vibration frequency and vibration time of mobile devices to explore whether there is any feeling difference between two ages.",

abstract="Throughout human history, cities have been centres of prosperity, ideas and innovation. These days, smart cities are creating a new buzzword across the world. Examples boom in Japan, Europe, UAE and Singapore while several others are shaping up on the drawing board. With the recent announcement of 100 new Smart Cities, the Government of India has strategically responded to both the international call for innovation and transformative sustainability as well as growing domestic pressure in cities. Interestingly, there is neither an internationally accepted definition of a Smart City, nor does India have any national policy on urbanization. Within this science-policy vacuum, there is a fair degree of consensus on what a smart city looks like, but no understanding on what are the inputs and strategies to achieve one. With numerous expectations, inhibitions and euphoria around this theme, this paper attempts to systematically investigate what is a smart city, how it is different from similar prototypes like a sustainable, green and low-carbon city and what are the global best practices. The article addresses some of the ideological, technical, societal, governance and financial challenges that India faces to attain the `100 Smart Cities' goal, and what would be its policy implications. In the process, the research proposes a new idiom for SMART---Sustainability, Metrics, Adaptiveness, Reporting, Technology for Inclusiveness.",

abstract=" Recent data of the European Union reveals that the main chronic pathologies are the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), the main cause of death in Europe, and respiratory diseases, specially the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Each year CVD causes over 4 million deaths in Europe alone and over 1.9 million deaths in the European Union (EU). According to the WHO (World Health Organization), in 2030 COPD will be the third leading cause of death, and the first cause of sanitary costs in Europe, due to the profiles of the expenses in health sector and the long time expenses by age groups and their important associate morbidity. New medical applications based on remote monitoring can help treat those chronic diseases but significantly will increase the volume of health information to manage, including data from medical and biological sensors, being then necessary to process this huge volume of data using techniques from Big Data. In this paper we propose one potential solution for creating those new services, based on Big Data processing and IoT concepts.",

abstract="Over the past century, in the most developed and rapidly developing countries, there has been a continuous increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public health, nutrition, and medicine. However, this is now in parallel with aging population demographics and falling birth rates, which when combined, are expected to significantly burden the socio-economic well-being of many of these countries. In fact, never in human history have we been confronted with such a large aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions their healthcare and social needs, as well as the well-being of the elderly. In this paper, we will describe an ongoing project in Ubiquitous (U)-Healthcare - a smart medical home. In our research work, we are using advances in Information Technology (IT), wireless communication, web-based technologies, and autonomics, to develop new, smart, and cost-effective solutions for the health wellness of the elderly. Such a solution would enable the elderly to lead independent lifestyles in their own homes while being continuously, non-invasively, and non-intrusively monitored for the early detection of symptoms, so diseases can be treated in the early stages; to promote health wellness; as well as to treat chronic illnesses. In this research paper, through a few examples, we will discuss our ongoing work and the challenges we have uncovered, plus some of the research issues we are pursuing. We will particularly focus on the critical role of IT in developing innovative, low-cost, and high impacting solutions to the pending elderly demographic crisis. Several examples will be given to highlight IT for U-Health.",

The United Nations (UN) said repeatedly that in 2050 a 70 {\%} of the world population would live in cities and some of them would have more than ten millions of residents. The purpose of this chapter is to make an approximation to the smart cities concept and to deepen into the application and the results of this kind of models of the urban development. The methodology is based on a theoretical--practical analysis of the smart cities. For this purpose an exhaustive analysis of the most recent economic literature on this topic has been done. Moreover, some of the most important results of this new model of the urban development have been indicated, so they can be applied to the problems that some cities have, and a case study has been done as well.",

To do so, we analysed the texts included in the websites of two major international Conferences on Smart Cities, and we used the Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach to examine a representative sample of 114 publications on Smart Cities. We found that Smart City research was hosted in Architecture and Social Sciences journals in the first place, but since 2007--2008 the interest in this issue boomed among Engineering and Computer Science scholars. Whilst there is a growing number of publications describing many ICT-enabled solutions for enhancing the competitiveness, sustainability and livability of cities, only few studies have addressed the organizational issues implied in such innovations so far. On the other side, our graph describing the interdisciplinary links within the 118 analysed publications shows that management studies occupy a strategic position within the interdisciplinary network of Smart City research. Then, Management and Information Systems scholars are given the opportunity to fill an important gap in an emerging stream of studies.",

abstract="At present, cyber security is increasingly threatened by cyber attacks, crime and privacy disclosure, which are penetrating areas like politics, economy, culture and society. All countries are strengthening their attention to cyber security and have taken a series of actions in accordance with their own situation and the world Internet development to improve their capacity of cyber security assurance. (1) Cyber attacks are becoming more hidden but more destructive. Technically peacocking represented by CIH virus, Melissa and Code Red virus are replaced by purposeful and organized attacks represented by Worm.WhBoy.cw, Stuxnet and Ukraine Power Grid Incident. Governmental intervention is being deepened. (2) Web spoofing, DDoS, Trojan and botnet, and cybercrime are the major threats to cyber security. In 2016, at least 255,100 phishing attacks happened worldwide, an increase of over 10{\%} in comparison with the number (230, 300) in 2015. Actually, the number in 2016 was unprecedentedly high. Every year, about 500 million host computers are attacked by botnets, 18 computers per second, resulting in a loss as high as US{\$}110 billion. (3) Advanced persistent threats are becoming increasingly serious with great power of destruction, imperceptibility, durability and complexity, posing great threat to critical infrastructure of finance, business, communication and transportation, and national defense. (4) The number of ransom software attacks is growing explosively. By the end of 2016, such software had evolved into a family-like development mode, with 44,300 new varieties having been discovered and 114 countries having been affected. RaaS is developed into a black industrial chain. From 2016 to 2017, the market scale of the underground market of ransom software saw an increase of 2502{\%}. (5) Large-scale data breach happens frequently, threatening the security of data from governments, businesses and individuals. From 2008 to 2016, over seven billion pieces of online ID information worldwide was embezzled, which indicates that every person's information is embezzled once. The governmental data of Sweden, Mexico and the Philippines were disclosed, which should arouse the attention of all governmental sectors. (6) With the maturity of IoT and AI, the equipment of IoT and AI may be the major targets of cyber attacks. By the end of 2016, it had been discovered that 2526 control servers had controlled 1.254 million intelligent devices of IoT of the world. Therefore, we should attach equal importance to security and development and take actions in advance to prevent any attack. (7) The United States, Russia, China, Germany and Singapore have launched national cyber security strategies and established special organizations to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure. They also enhance cyber content security supervision and promote the development of cyber security industries. (8) The position of cyber security has been elevated in the overall national security. Some countries have channeled cyber security into military security to enhance its importance. The United Sates has elevated Cyber Command to be the highest United Combatant Command. Germany and Israel have also founded their cyber commands to improve cyber military fighting capacity, which, at the same time, brings about new factors of instability of cyberspace.",

As a support, web services have been released to establish the way how web applications interchange information by using XML, JSON or other plain formats. In this paper, we describe a general Back-End solution to store heterogeneous data collected from different sources. We used the stack named ``MEAN'' to program web services, and JSON as the data model to interchange information.

Since the elderly have different health problems that the rest of the population, we need a deep change in national's health policy to get adapted to population ageing.

abstract="Medication non-adherence in seniors can lead to severe health complications, including morbidity, mortality and decreased quality of life. In view of ageing populations worldwide, there is significant interest among the healthcare sector and researchers to improve medication adherence rates for seniors. However, existing studies in the literature focus primarily on identifying the predictors of medication non-adherence. In this paper, we present our work on technology-enabled medication adherence for 24 community-dwelling seniors over a period of more than 2 years. We leverage Internet of Things (IoT) devices to track inferred medication consumption in the seniors' homes, and provide quasi real-time alerts to community caregivers, who can then intervene in a timely manner. Our study suggests that seniors generally do not consume medication on a regular basis (in both the frequency and time domains). However, technology-based approaches that allow for real-time tracking and appropriate interventions by caregivers can be effective in improving the medication adherence of these seniors.",

abstract="The increasing availability of low-cost smart devices is bringing them to be used more and more in the smart home. However, the development of a smart home environment requires to take into account several aspects. First of all, designers must consider the end user (namely the person that actually uses the smart home), and not only the technology, at the center of any intervention. Another important aspect is the interaction between the smart home and the appliances that are already deployed in the same smart environment. Moreover, most of smart home solutions are static and do not allow end users to customize them according to their real needs and preferences. Finally, not all end users may possess the necessary knowledge and skills to customize a smart home, but someone else, such as an adult child or a caregiver, may be called on to carry out this task for them. In this paper, we analyze all these aspects that can influence the development and evolution of a smart home. We then propose a model supporting developers and software engineers to deploy and evaluate a smart home solution that adopts end-user development techniques. It is based on the International Classification of Functioning scale, which is used to characterize the person that is mainly going to live in the smart home and define a solution suitable to his/her needs.",

abstract="The services provided by smart cities are based on complex information infrastructures composed of a broad range of interdependent but loosely coupled technological, organizational, institutional and legal systems. The development and evolution of information infrastructures enabling smart services provision follows logics and paths that are substantially different from the ones of self-contained technologies or plug and play applications. In this chapter, we argue that the investigation of these phenomena needs to be carried out with a case study approach, which looks not only at development but also at longer-term evolution dynamics. At the same time, a better understanding of information infrastructures logics and paths is highly relevant for policy makers and project managers, in order to be able to govern such initiatives. For the purpose of showing some of the key feature of this infrastructural dimension, this chapter analyses the development of an e-Prescription system in Italy. As many other digital services provided by smart cities, digital prescription service is the result of practices distributed across a network of actors and digital solutions, which work across organizations. In addition, they are at the intersection of multiple logics which aim at the creation of different public values such as economic---through expenditures control and efficient allocation of resources-, legal---through transactions traceability and doctors' accountability-, and service quality---providing the users with better services through a smarter management of the information and resources. Thus, this case provides the occasion to examine the multilevel infrastructural complexity upon which smart cities initiatives are built, showing the mix of local, regional and national layers enabling a smart prescription services provision.",

abstract="In times of the demographic change and the increasing need of novel concepts to meet the requirements of older adults' care in the near future, health care robots could be a potent solution to meet shortcomings in the health care sector. Even though the potential of robotic home care assistance is promising, the question if older persons would accept a robotic assistance at home is still underexplored. Adopting a three-step procedure, older adults' perceptions towards home care robots are empirically explored. In a first step, focus groups were accomplished to understand older persons' perceptions on benefits and barriers. Second, a survey study was applied to determine acceptance criteria, the perceived usefulness and the extent and types of concerns toward a domestic robot in homecare. Finally, in a further survey study, specific care situations in the home care settings had to be evaluated in a third study, thereby comparing preferences for a human care persons vs. a robotic care assistant. Outcomes reveal both, age-sensitive as well as age-insensitive findings. While overall a positive attitude towards home care robots was found, serious concerns in terms of fear of loss of control and connection to family members are prevailing. Outcomes contribute to an understanding of social factors in the development and implementation of accepted home care solutions and might be helpful to develop age-sensitive information and communication concepts.",

abstract="The idea of connecting physical things and cyber components to enable new and richer interactions is a key component in any smart space concept. One of the central challenges in these new smart spaces is the access control of data, services and things. In recent years, Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) like Blockchain Technology (BCT), emerged as the most promising solution for decentralized access management. Using capability-based access control, access to data/services/things is achieved by transferring tokens between the accounts of a distributed ledger. Managing how the access tokens are transferred is, of course, a major challenge. Within the IoT space, smart contracts are at the center of most of the proposals for DLT/BCT networks targeting access control. The main problem in using smart contracts as a means for checking if and what access token can be transferred from one account to another is their immutability and accessibility. Smart contracts and chain code are by design meant to be immutable since they represent a binding contract between parties. In addition, they need to be accessible since they are to be executed on many nodes. This allows an attacker to study them and design the attack in a manner that passes the rules of the smart contract/chain code. This paper focuses on the use of metadata as a more effective means to prevent attackers from gaining access to data/services/things in a smart living space.",

abstract="Kenya intends to transition into a middle-income economy by 2030. According to the 2008 Kenya Vision 2030 strategy, this goal would be achieved by growing the country's gross domestic product (GDP) at an average rate of 10 {\%} per annum between 2012 and 2030. Eight years after enactment of the vision 2030 strategy as the country's long-term growth blueprint, the country's economy is still dragging behind, with an average GDP growth rate that is about half the target rate. Recent reviews by the World Bank indicate that for Kenya to achieve middle-income country status by the end of the planning period, her gross national income per capita needs to triple from the {\$}1290 recorded in 2014 to {\$}4125 by 2030, and her GDP needs to grow at a rate of about 7 {\%} until 2030. In a country where the productive sectors of the economy (manufacturing) are overshadowed by both agriculture and low-technology small-scale enterprises and informal activities, this goal seems far-fetched. Recent investments in infrastructure development, and particularly on information communication technologies (ICTs), have, however, opened a new growth trend, which when properly explored could trigger rapid economic growth and help the country achieve the 2030 goal. Rapid adoption of ICTs in various economic sectors, particularly the growth of e-commerce, e-finance and e-governance, coupled with friendly policies and a rapidly emerging middle class are already causing an economic revolution, particularly in Nairobi---the country's capital city and commercial hub. This chapter explores Nairobi's economic growth trajectory within the framework of Kenya's long- and short-term economic goals. It identifies that an ICT-driven smart economic growth revolution has started in the city, in both the formal and informal sectors, and establishes that there are massive opportunities for sustained growth. These opportunities, which emanate from increasing investment in ICT infrastructure development, ICT education, an innovative population and suitable government policies, will greatly help shape the country's economic growth in the next decade. The chapter also identifies that challenges such as cyber security, a thin manufacturing sector, slow adoption of e-commerce, a hugely informal economy and little research on innovative technologies and their adoption are limiting the city's smart transition.",

In today's global networking scenario where everything is technology driven, the importance of information and communication technology (ICT) cannot be undermined. They offer swift and real-time information and are easily accessible. However, can the cities be labelled as smart just by improvising ICTs or there might be other parameters involved in making a city truly smart? The paper henceforth explores such possibilities of making a city smart by taking case studies of known cities/neighbourhoods who have optimised these standards for success. People's participation in using these technologies and the user experience is one of the important consideration so that they are ready to experience a livable smart and organised city. Smart governance, smart planning, smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment and smart living are also the main highlights of the paper on which the case studies are based to analyse smart cities and provide important basis to emphasise if the proposed 100 smart cites in India can really rise up to the level of smart city parameters and tell a success story.Is it only the ICTs that are responsible for making a city smart or a holistic approach is required?Are we smart enough to embrace a smart city?",

abstract="Power saving is the important issue nowadays, and it is more critical in hostels because of some irresponsible students who leave the room without switching OFF the tubes lights and fans. So, for controlling this wastage of electricity in hostels, we have tried here to develop this system that helps in monitoring and managing the electrical power requirement. In this system, IR sensors sensed the presence of students in the room with the help of counter. When it counts one, it means students enters the room, this counter increases and so on. When the student leaves the room, it decreases the count and when it reaches up to zero, this indicates that no one is present in the room. At this time, after few seconds, the switches will automatically turn OFF, if it is ON, and this information will be sent to the server/cloud where the authorized person can see or watch all the activities in the room. Here, we need only Internet for watching the online process. This will be in the form of notification where it will show the room number, OFF time. The other feature of this system is, when such notifications will be seen on the screen, one SMS will be sent to the student about Rs. 100/- penalty or punishment.

abstract="The general increase in life expectancy and the consequent ageing of the general population impose major challenges to modern societies. Most elderly people experience the typical problems related to old age, such as chronic health problems, as well as sensory and cognitive impairments. In addition, in today's modern societies, where families have less and less time to look after their older relatives, the isolation of the elderly is a real concern and a highly recurrent problem, which is enhanced when they live alone. To solve, or at least minimize, these problems, a smart home monitoring system was developed, as presented and described in this paper. This solution is implemented based on a sensory network which detects anomalous behaviors, immediately triggering a warning to the caregiver or family.",

With the advent of gesture recognition hardware and frameworks, it is now envisioned that most of the household activities that are used on a daily basis, can now be operated using gestures. This will allow people with special to use their natural gestures to interact with different interfaces, whether it be appliances or accessing Internet-based healthcare services. In this article, we present a gesture based natural user interface framework, which supports a set of smart home services through gestures. In order to get feedback from the user interaction, a reverse feedback mechanism is implemented, which keeps track of how many gestures are working correctly. We have developed a mathematical model to represent proposed framework. From the user feedback and analysis of the gathered system testing data, we are optimistic about the deployment of the proposed framework in real life scenarios.",

These will appear in smart homes, as well as in commercial spaces, in automobile vehicles, in personal or business-owned clothing, and even toys. As the electronics become available to industry, smart textiles could be embedded with electronics capable of receiving and transmitting data packets. The implications are that soft furnishings or any surfaces with a textile have the potential capability of connecting to the Cloud.

abstract="This chapter focuses on how ICT can be deployed to assist in the design and delivery of innovative public services in support of sustainable development. In many parts of the world, and especially in developing countries, basic public services like education, health, basic infrastructures, as well as water and sanitation, are often poor and patchy even when available. Such services are reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030, and also address challenges like poverty, food, housing and employment. All of these need innovative public service delivery if targets are to be achieved by 2030. However, the provision of such services is increasingly challenged by the diversity of social needs across different locations and population segments. Mainstream, largely off-the-shelf, ICT has tremendous potential today and in the near future to innovatively address these needs and challenges, and there are already many valuable experiences both from developed and developing countries about how this can make huge differences to public service delivery. The chapter also addresses the governance and policy issues that need to be addressed in this context.",

abstract="The smart cities initiative does not consist of filling our cities with tech gadgets, cameras and sensors for the purpose of monitoring and controlling both citizens and urban environment. The smart cities movement is not a marketplace for companies and businesses to sell their ICT products and services to governments. The smart cities objective is not to target the use of urban technology as an end in itself but as a tool towards more citizen-centric cities. Therefore, smart cities are not a big brother watching citizens but an inclusive and participatory arena for local governments and all interested stakeholders (including citizens) to co-create communities that can offer development opportunities to everyone and quality of live, no matter social group, age, or gender. This is the true objective of smart cities, which sometimes gets lost, forgotten or becomes shadowed by an excess of technology. But, how to achieve such a challenging objective? Fortunately, just recently, a definition on smart cities has been agreed by international standardization bodies which, so far, are the ones paving the way regarding concepts, terminology and general understanding of the smart cities movement. This novel definition builds on the sustainability concept, promotes urban development in good harmony with resilience, and uses technology only as a way for cities to measure their smartness and improve their performance. The author, aware of the big step forward that this internationally acknowledged definition is, takes the opportunity that this new piece of formally structured knowledge offers to elaborate a first-of-a-kind framework to conceptualize, model and simulate sustainability, and its practical implementation while promoting urban development and resilience to achieve higher performance levels of urban smartness.",

abstract="Asia is developing, and its cities are going to play a major role in this endeavour to match developed counterparts. Asian trade, population, geographic size of its cities and contribution to global development will only increase in the years to come. Rural settlements or underdeveloped villages are fast converting themselves to smaller towns; smaller towns are converting themselves into small cities, and existing small cities are forging ahead into becoming megacities. This demographic transformation in the urban landscape will only increase the use of resources like land, water, clean air, sanitation, power, transport network and safety in order to survive and grow. The quantity and quality of investment that Asian cities make today in these resources will help them service and sustain their burgeoning population in the future. It is therefore imperative that urban planning, use of technology, futuristic vision and control techniques that are incorporated, work in collaboration to achieve success. Present-day megacities like Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Manila, Jakarta, Mumbai, Delhi, Karachi, Istanbul, Tehran, Moscow, etc. have their own share of problems; and negotiating their population's ever-growing demands have turned into a herculean task. These cities can boast of a glorious and historic past, but how they mitigate their current issues, envisage future needs and meticulously plan their future are important. The concept of smart cities is not to be misunderstood as only constructing idealistic new cities from the scratch. While this could be constituted in some developed economies in Asia, having existing megacities and their urban sprawl change their style of operation to suit present and future needs could be a smarter and more beneficial solution. Cities are never built in a single day; they always evolve with time and with the evolving cultural fabric of its residents.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) implementation has spread to various fields, including healthcare. Personal healthcare device such as ECG senses very sensitive voltage from heart and stream the data in high speed to the IoT platform. Data from ECG can be used for many disease diagnoses, including Arrhythmia and sleep disorder. In order to obtain the optimum diagnosis result, IoT platform for healthcare should be able to handle very rapid data stream from users or devices simultaneously and keep the successful connections at a high rate. In this paper, an IoT architecture for healthcare implementing asynchronous processing is proposed. Asynchronous process allows the system to process the data outside the main loop of process. The proposed system measures HTTP successful connections and analytics accuracy. By implementing asynchronous processing, the system can increase the successful HTTP connection up to 50{\%} for 100 users testing scenario compared to the benchmark system. The increase of successful connections improves the analytics accuracy to 98.41{\%}.",

abstract="Cyber Physical Social Systems (CPSS) has been rapidly developing in recent years because of the dramatic growth of mobile techniques and Internet-based technologies. As an emerging novel technical paradigm, cloud computing is becoming an efficient mechanism that has been broadly implemented in multiple fields with using Internet-enabled devices. Telehealth system is one of the crucial domains in applications of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), which is also considered an important component in smart city. However, Personalized Cloud-based Telehealth (PCTH) is still facing a great challenge due to restrictions deriving from various perspectives, such as cloud resource allocations and real-time information transfers. This paper concentrates on the issue of optimizing the performance of the resource allocation for achieving smart tele-health with obtaining and analyzing real-time data within the dynamic application environment in cloud computing. The dynamic data environment is mainly associated with social connections generated by physicians or health organizations. Along with this focus, we propose a novel approach, entitled Smart Cloud-based Telehealth Cyber Physical Social Systems (SCT-CPSS), to enable mobile CPSS to offer users a real-time health information service based on the social networking behaviors and inputs. Main algorithms used in this proposed mechanism include Real-Time Matching with Dynamic Programming Algorithm (RTM-DPA) and Monte Carlo-based Real-Time Analysis Algorithm (MC-RTAA). Our experiment examination has evaluated the performance of the proposed paradigm.",

abstract="In the year 2008, the world faced one of the worst economic recessions. At this point in time, the idea of a smart city was floated by IBM which was a part of the smarter planet initiative (Paroutis et al. 2013). As per various definitions, a smart city is an urban development that takes the help of technology to manage its assets like its infrastructure, important buildings, community services, transportation. The concept of smart city was welcomed by China, UAE, Korea and others. There are six indicators of a smart city, namely ``smart economy, smart governance, smart citizen, smart living, smart environment and smart mobility'' (Kumar and Dahiya 2017)---mobility or transportation takes the most important position due to its influence on all the other indicators. Statistics show that millions of dollars are invested in research and development of new sustainable modes of transportation systems all over the globe. There are innumerable examples of sustainable smart transport all over the world like Paris, Boston, Germany, Singapore. Each one of these examples lays emphasis on the fact that a well-designed and efficient transport system contributes to economic growth and helps in refining the quality of life of the people, thereby becoming one of the most important sectors of urban development. Post-studying these examples, one can realize that sustainable transportation system contributes to all the different indicators or aspects of a smart city. It is projected by the United Nations that in the coming 15 years the population of top 100 cities of India will grow by 60{\%}. Also with growth in opportunities and increase in the buying capacity, personal motor-vehicle ownership doubles every decade. Land is a precious resource, and utilizing it for making roads to meet the needs of the motorized vehicles is not a solution. This chapter examines the Indian scenario and smart city dream and various successful models of sustainable transportation addressing issues similar to the existing Indian cities, and makes recommendations for the same.",

abstract="Aging is a natural phenomenon, and maintaining quality of life for elderly people and for people with special needs is a challenge. Many physiological functions tend toward decline, and people suffer from several chronic conditions in later stages of life, which usually lead to high drug consumption. Medication noncompliance remains a common healthcare problem and affects patient health adversely in the developed as well as in the underdeveloped world. Patients with chronic illnesses are often burdened with high medication intake and less awareness of their medical conditions and routine, creating a challenging environment to promote medication compliance. Technological assistance like the emergence of smartphone echoes opportunities for utilization of health services with minimal interaction, portability, and pervasiveness. This paper focuses on an augmented reality/computer vision-based solution for drug compliance for elderly people; with this, patients will be having greater control over medication management easily and flexibly keeping in view the usage/learning constraints of senior citizens via Smart Assist. Smart Assist has expected to fulfill the unrestricted conditions of healthcare applications.",

abstract="Research on smart city projects and applications has been increasing in recent years (Meijer and Bolivar 2015). The smart city concept is mostly considered from a technologyTechnology-oriented perspective that stresses the use of data technologies, big data and ICT to `smarten up' cities. In contrast, attention to soft aspects of the smart city---namely smart governanceGovernance, people and social learningSocial learning---seems to be limited in both academia and practice. Moreover, what seems to be largely missing from the literature is empirical insight into the extent to which different smart city aspects are factually known of and applied in different geographical contexts. This contribution presents a contextual comparison of smart city applications based on a mainly quantitativeQuantitativeempirical analysis. Particular emphasis is put on the knowledge that government practitionersPractitionerin the Netherlands have of smart aspects and the extent to which they are willing and able to implement smart aspects in their specific local and regional contexts. The results of the analysis show that both in the NetherlandsNetherlandsand worldwide there are great aspirations to develop and implement smart city applications, but that to some extent factual activities are lagging behind. The reasons for this are mostly related to a lack of awareness of the possibilities and a lack of financial and political priority. This especially applies to smaller cities in the Netherlands. When this is resolved, actual activities are more likely to live up to the great aspirations regarding the smart city concept.",

abstract="A smart city is viewed as a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous city that promotes a people-centric approach based on three core components and seven dimensions. The three core components are Smart City Foundation, Smart ICT and Smart Institutions and Laws, which in turn are the pillars of the seven dimensions of a smart city: Infrastructure Development, Environmental Sustainability, Social Development, Social Inclusion, Disasters Exposure, Resilience, and Peace and Security. The three components together with the seven dimensions make a Smart Economy. Infrastructure development has several elements across various social, economic and environmental dimensions. Here, our analysis focuses on those connecting people to several categories of services, particularly transport and ICT infrastructures. The first section analyses the classical option of connecting people to services through non-motorized means or motorized means of transport. The interaction between the development of urban spatial patterns and transport is thus a key factor shaping accessibility in cities both in physical and in socioeconomic terms. To access to services such as work, to the health centers, to the school or to the market among several other destinations, the share of motorized means is 40 {\%} (public an private) compared to 60 {\%} for the non-motorized means, mainly by walking. The public transport sector is predominantly informal (95 {\%} against 5 {\%} for the formal sector). Turning informal transport sector challenges to opportunities in the smart city making is a call along with the enhancement of the public sector with the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and other higher efficient means of public transport. In the absence of affordable, reliable public transport, the poor are no choice rather walking to access to services. It is urgent to make streets friendly to pedestrians with sufficient public spaces for social interactions. Today, it is recognized that the information and communication technology (ICT) development is an important enabler of accessing to services and must be integrated in the planning and management of transport systems. For these past 15 years, the Senegalese government has taken various steps to create an environment favorable to the development and use of ICT at all levels. It has created legal institutional framework to support regulatory mechanisms on the development and use of ICT and has also introduced ICT platforms such as E-Governance, E-Education, E-infrastructure and supports education and training on ICT.

abstract="Global demographic trends clearly point out that the world population is aging due to a combination of dropping mortality rates and increasing life expectancy. The global community is seeking solutions to address the pressing societal challenge of providing effective and efficient healthcare to the elderly. It is difficult to achieve satisfactory results merely by relying on scaling up conventional healthcare infrastructures. These techniques will not be sufficient to independently assist the elderly to live alone in a house mainly if they are suffering from chronic diseases, thus require continuous health monitoring. It is imperative to exploit the advances in emerging technologies such as biosensors, mobile devices, and communication networks to provide remote health monitoring services along with the physical infrastructural facilities. Remote and continuous monitoring of patients with chronic diseases is being considered as an efficient and cost-effective solution, which will reduce the burden on the elderly and his/her families, as well as on the health government's expenses. While considerable research and development is being undertaken in this field, most of the current state of the art reflects a lack of a concerted and cohesive approach to develop an integrated remote health monitoring system. This chapter surveys existing pervasive healthcare systems and classifies them as academia based or industrial based, and then it develops a set of criteria to compare these solutions. It discusses some drawbacks of existing solutions and proposes future directions in pervasive healthcare, which are predicted to shape future pervasive healthcare systems. Finally, it proposes a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on an integrated and scalable architecture, which provides flexibility and enables interoperability between myriads of healthcare monitoring devices. The proposed framework relies on the analytics of both evidenced data collected from sensors as well as the massive data collected from social networks. A prototype of the framework has been developed to evaluate the applicability and the efficiency of monitoring and analytics practices.",

Place branding thus suggests that places, cities, regions or countries could be considered as brands, as long as it is perceived so. There are lot much challenges in place branding. Due to the changes in the economical, cultural and social changes in the global landscape, there exists a fierce competition among multiple destinations for resources, business relocation, foreign investment and visitors and even for migrants and residents. Based on the prevailing definition of marketing from American Marketing Association, this chapter attempts to use the basic formwork of creating value, communicating value and delivering value in explaining the marketing process of Calicut as a smart city destination. Four elements that are unique to the cultural and geographic aspects of Calicut are identified, which include Calicut cuisine, Uru (traditional vessel), Kalaripayattu (traditional martial art form) and Calicut trade hub. These elements have different value propositions and thus cater to different target customers refer as stakeholders. Using Aaker's model of brand equity, a detailed study about these elements is conducted and a set of brand elements are identified. Subsequently, other aspects of the brand charter including the brand promise, colour and typology are also identified. Finally, the way of delivering the value to stakeholders through e-marketing and social media platforms is also discussed for all the four elements.",

In this paper, we analyse the main characteristics of these projects and we wonder about the appropriate methodologies and managerial styles to lead them. We argue that these projects are complex in nature, according to the current literature on project complexity and thus, classical project management approaches might be unsuitable for managing them. We suggest some clues to seek for new managerial styles, mainly in the literature concerning innovation and new product development and within the ``Agile'' approach.",

abstract="The essence of intelligent assistive technologies in smart homes can be outlined as their ability to enhance the user experience in many ways. A way to accomplish this goal is to make such systems aware and knowledgeable about user interactions in the context of the given environment. In the context of smart homes, the ability of such intelligent systems to understand and analyze human behavior in the context of Activities of Daily Living is very essential. Modern day software-based solutions for development of such intelligent systems, should not only be able to sense human movements through Internet of Things based technologies but they should also be able to analyze these components of user interactions in a manner that facilitates optimal utilization of system resources, increases software productivity, improves system interoperability, reduces development and maintenance costs and allows both internal and external reusability of the solutions. Therefore, this paper discusses a study on the `Complex Activity Recognition Algorithm' [1] and proposes a systematic approach to improve this algorithm for better performance and system optimization. The improved version of this algorithm has been tested on several activities and the results obtained uphold the relevance for implementation of the same in different real-time environments.",

abstract="Living Labs are places for real-life test and experimentation where users and experts co-create innovative products and services through an ICT-based collaboration. Founded in the context of private firms, LLs evolved into a policy tool implemented to facilitate service innovation also in the public sector. Furthermore, due to their strong focus on user participation, LLs are now increasingly central in the smart-city strategy of various municipalities such as Barcelona, Helsinki, Tallinn and Birmingham. Citizen creativity, in fact, is an integral part of smart cities and the `laboratory dimension' perfectly fits with this new approach to urban development. Namely, the transformation of the city into a living lab is aimed at supporting the process of policy innovation at the municipal level through local empowerment and the promotion of partnership among enterprises, public administration and citizens. In this respect, LLs can be viewed as a new form of co-production that is a process through which citizens participate in the design and creation of products or services that are less expensive and better tailored to citizens' needs. Drawing on data related to 59 LLs listed in the database of the European Network of LLs, the paper is aimed at describing the main characteristics of LLs and at examining their strengths and weaknesses as co-production tools.",

Thirty peer-reviewed research studies published in 2018 were reviewed and compared according to certain parameters, viz., algorithms, IoT sensors, data encryption ability, communication mechanisms, mobile accessibility, protocols, software, and platforms. The results illustrate that transmitting sensitive medical data over the Internet has been identified as a major threat, and solutions such as ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption and Secure Better Portable Graphics (SBPG) architecture have been developed to authenticate and protect data by concurrent encryption and watermarkingWatermarking. Furthermore, the comparison reveals that data encryption is the most frequently used secure data transmission method and 32{\%} of the reviewed studies have focused on this. Regarding the most frequently used technologies, Raspberry Pi3Raspberry Pi3Edge platformEdge platform(with the usage percentage of 60), TCP/IP protocolTCP/IP protocol(with usage of 38{\%}), and ECGECGand temperature sensors (with usage of 20{\%}) have been discussed.

This presents a serious constraint when gait analysis is supposed to drive context aware applications. To this end, this work applies density based clustering algorithms on gait and trajectory IoT data recorded from real senior homes (``on the wild''). The indoor analytics client analyzes high density regions rendered from locations in real senior homes facilitated by IoT technology consisting of events describing the seniors' position. These are collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client taking into account the available processing resources and configuring itself to deliver the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained by analyzing a whole week's data in two seniors' homes. The algorithm performance and accuracy with respect to the number of points included in the analysis are presented and discussed.",

abstract="Proposed in recent years, smart health has gained great attention after its debut. Undoubtedly, wearable devices will bring great convenience to the development of smart health. With the aging trend, increase of empty families and solitary elderly people, and the growth spurt of chronic disease, wearable devices have come to its spring. But due to the lack of standards in the industry, the data collected by wearable devices is unreliable, and is difficult to be accepted by doctors. Besides, there are also some problems concerning with privacy. In this paper, the advantages, disadvantages, opportunities and obstacles of wearable devices are analyzed, and some development suggestions are provided.",

abstract="The tenets of the concept of building smart cities are focused on the technological and social development, which is ultimately expected to enhance the city dwellers' quality of life. Local government units play a key role in this context. The way local government units manage the cities bears on what they look like and determines the dwellers' quality of life. Hence, it is of paramount importance for the municipalities (gmina) and districts (powiat) to take into account and implement the sustainable development concept, which builds i.a. on an open stakeholder dialogue. Actions of this kind contribute to building the social capital in the long run. The paper is aimed at elaborating on the notions related to the smart city idea, as well as the notion of the quality of life in the light of the roles assigned to local government units. The issues in question will be discussed on the basis of results of surveys conducted among the municipalities in Poland.",

abstract="In this chapter, I focus on data-mining and data analytics. It is obvious that without integrated databases set up for collecting, collating, managing and disseminating data derived from various identification, monitoring and surveillance systems, all efforts in this direction would be in vain -- which is why we need to discuss such computerized databases first. But databases are just the beginning: nowadays, computers can tap into the World Wide Web to proactively search all kinds of social media including listen in on phone calls to detect suspicious behaviour, to profile individual terrorists or suspects. This process is known as data mining and acquisition, and similar to what many private companies such as Google or Facebook routinely do ways as well. I argue that currently, the `holy grail' of data-mining and acquisition is to be able to do so in real time, while `it' happens. With a discussion of this current cutting edge of research and the implications for our civil liberties, I conclude this chapter.",

abstract="Although health monitoring systems in smart homes have been revealed as a significant tool to help people ageing in place, the density of data poses a challenge on the information visualization. This review aims to make contributions to find gaps in the field of information visualization regarding smart home monitoring for older people. Three kinds of information needs of older adults and their informal caregivers regarding smart home monitoring are categorized, including physical needs, emotional needs and cognitive needs. The research studies reflect that these needs are mainly used to discuss ideas of, design approaches for, the information visualization from ten aspects in the visceral level, behavioral level and reflective level. Results show that there is still a big gap existing in enabling older people and their informal caregivers to better understand smart home monitoring information. Some existing design recommendations can be improved while at the same time, some needs have not been manifested through information visualization. A wider understanding of older adults, informal caregivers and home living environment in all aspects are necessary.",

Many children with autism are highly interested and motivated by smart devices such as computers and touch screen tablets. These types of assistive technology devices get children with autism to interact, make choices, respond, and tell parents what they want, need, think, and maybe even feel. Out framework uses JXTA-Overlay platform and smartbox device to monitor the children and create P2P communication between children, parents and therapists. Various visual systems, such as objects, photographs, realistic drawings, line drawings, and written words, can be used with assorted modes of technology, as long as the child can readily comprehend the visual representation. Vocabulary skills such as names of common everyday objects, fruits, animals, toys, names of familiar people can be taught through our proposed framework.",

abstract="IoT enabled smart environments typically include large number of simple sensors that are designed to detect specific events. In many environments, however, not one but combinations of sensor events represent activities of interest (such as activities of daily living of a patient in a smarthome). Detecting and monitoring these activities of interest result in both application-specific benefits and operational benefits. However, human activities often overlap, thereby making activity detection from the collected sensor events a challenging problem. In this paper, we first present the various benefits of such materialization of sensor events into activities, and then discuss the challenges in detecting diverse activities taken up by humans. More interestingly, the diversity of human activities and the time-variability of a given activity by the same human, makes reliable detection of activities even harder, and open up interesting avenues for future research.",

abstract="The terms Smart University and Smart Campus reflect the various opportunities provided by universities to achieve better experiences for locals to improve campus efficiency and cut down operating expenses. Both directions try to help their users reach their aims much easier. Several new aspects and technologies have appeared in the last few years and gained greater emphasis in areas such as Big Data, IoT (Internet of Things), Future Internet, and Crowdsourcing. A University is a proper place where all of these fields could be examined and applied continuously as a sustainable evolution. In this paper, we investigate software systems and related aspects of this evolution to introduce an open architecture for easily extensible services. These services are responsible to provide their users value-added information. This will increase the smartness level of the campus. We investigated three directions for this reason: IoT to involve sensing, cloud and ubiquitous computing to make our services available everywhere, and to transform our service consumers to content generators or, in other words, data producers and/or developers for new data source connections. The fourth direction, Big Data, is a forthcoming addition to the previous three for enhanced analytical capabilities to Smart Communities.",

abstract="A population is called ageing when the proportion of aged 60 or 65 years is increasing in total population. This is a dynamics of decline in fertility and mortality which may be modified by migration of young population in a specific geographical region. To understand the condition of the aged, the study relied on different official secondary data sources. National Capital Territory of Delhi is the capital of India and while coping with globalization, the city has experienced large amount of growth in creation of economic opportunities which has attracted a large number of young male migrants. It has provided the region a relatively young age structure with lesser proportion of aged population than the country's average. Elderly sex ratio also, which otherwise favours females is favouring males in this region. Commensurating with previous studies it is observed that even in the capital city, women headship is low when they are in the union and they get headship of the household with increase in age and mostly when they are not in the union. Living arrangement is distressing where nearly 2 {\%} of the households are exclusively all-aged households irrespective of the number of persons in the household. Little less than half (46 {\%}) of the male elderly in 60--69 age group are working as main worker, which is extremely high. This has reduced the number of economically dependents in Delhi. However, it is important to mention that proportion of pensioner is also quite higher in Delhi than country as a whole. High work participation may be linked with the lesser morbidity of the Delhi's elderly where both the incidence and rate of hospitalization are substantially low. However, surveys have observed that crime against the elderly is much higher in Delhi than it is in many other urban centres in India. Delhi Government has shown its concern in this and taken initiative to address the same. However, a comprehensive database focusing on elderly is required for Delhi as it is experiencing fast change.",

abstract="The aging of the world population has a strong impact on the world wide health care expenditure and is especially significant for countries providing free health care services to their population. One of the consequences is the increase in semi-autonomous persons requiring to be placed in specialized long term care centers. These kinds of facilities are very costly and often not appreciated by their residents. The idea of ``aging in place'' or living in one's home independently is a key solution to counter the impact of institutionalization. It can decrease the costs for the institutions while maximizing the quality of life of the individuals. However, these semi-autonomous persons require assistance during their daily life activities that professionals cannot hope to completely fill. Many envision the use of the smart home concept, a home equipped with distributed sensors and effectors, to add an assistance layer for these semi-autonomous populations. Still, despite years of research, there are several challenges to overcome in order to implement the smart home dream. This chapter positions itself as an easy to read introduction for readers unfamiliar with the challenges faced by computer science researchers regarding this difficult endeavor. It aims to walk the reader through the cornerstones of smart home research for health care.",

Recognizing the significance of cities in its future, the Government of India (GoI), in June 2015, launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM), which focuses on the sustainable and inclusive development of Indian cities. This research aims to assess and analyse the synchronisation achieved between the two global treaties namely Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) and New Urban Agenda (NUA) and SCM, twenty months post the commencement of SCM. The research analyses secondary data from existing SCM statements and guidelines and assesses them with respect to SDG 11 and NUA. Subsequently, it focuses on top nineteen cities under SCM.

In contrast to traditional wireless sensor networks (WSN), the provided content may include video and audio streams and still images in addition to traditional scalar data such as temperature, humidity or light intensity. One of the core requirements for WSNs is energy efficiency: for maintenance reasons, the battery life must be long enough to provide feasible maintenance interval, rather months or years than days or weeks. The requirement is elaborated in WMSNs where video and audio capturing nodes inherently consume more energy than traditional scalar sensor nodes while the battery life requirements remain high. However, current technology base of video and audio surveillance does not enable sufficient energy-saving features to support ultra-low-energy multimedia sensor networking. In this chapter, we present a set of optimization methods to make WMSNs more energy efficient. The methods include energy-efficient hardware architectures combined with energy-optimized network topology management, lightweight virtualization and lightweight security solutions. The optimization methods are evaluated using real-life prototype implementations. The results provide an insight into effective methods for implementing energy-efficient WMSN.",

abstract="Tracking indoor locations of residents is a prerequisite of accurate monitoring and advanced understanding of human activities in smart homes. Without using any indoor video surveillance devices in terms of preserving privacy and security, majority of existing approaches often utilise wearable BLE/RFID sensor tags to track locations of residents through analysing variations of received signal strength and angle of sensor tags. In a multi-residential environment, these tags can also be used as unique identifiers to help distinguish individuals. However, the extra burdens of remembering and wearing sensor tags all day along restrict them to be widely accepted by senior communities, let alone by people with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we propose a novel indoor tracking technique for smart homes with multiple residents, through relying only on non-wearable, environmentally deployed sensors such as passive infrared motion sensors. We design a multi-tracker system that uses multiple, independent probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes and hidden Markov model, to track different residents' movements separately. We evaluate our tracking technique on real sensor data acquired from a dual-occupancy smart home in our clinical trials. The experiment results, through comparing with location details acquired by wearable tags, demonstrate that our proposed technique is a simple yet feasible solution to tracking multi-residents' indoor movements.",

The first case study is exemplified on two systems, namely Servei d'Ocupaci{\'o} de Catalunya (SOC) and Borsa Lavoro Lombardia (BLL), two web portals implementing active policies to prevent unemployment. The discussion claims that both systems have been developed in a co-production style, although this was not explicitly stated. The second case study is discussed using the Attiv@bili project of Regione Lombardia, where we developed the technological platform supporting integrated services for various actors: patients and their families, public administrations involved in care, cooperatives, medical doctors, and others. Finally, we present an overview of recent ICT methods and tools and their use to improve and facilitate co-production with examples for the use cases.",

abstract="Healthcare awareness is being increased due to an advancement made on technology and medical science field for providing consciousness about nutrition, environmental, and personal hygiene. Aging population increase life expectancy globally and cause danger to socio-economic structure in terms of cost related to wellbeing and healthcare of elderly people. Migration of people to cities and urban areas affects healthcare services in great extent. Nowadays, cities present in the world invest heavily in digital transformation for providing healthy environment to elderly people. Healthcare application is merely based on activity, social interactions, and physiological signs of elderly people for the recommendation system. Measurement of physiological signs may include wearable or ambient sensors to gather information related to elderly people health conditions. Better recommendations can be provided to elderly people merely based on three terms. First, recommendations through personal details of elderly people collected in day-to-day life. Second, measure of health conditions such as pulse rate, blood pressure and heart beat. Third, social interactions based stress of elderly people in social media is determined by collecting elderly people posts and updates. Depending on the unruffled information recommendations are generated.",

The aim of this research is to explore examples of such devices and applications used to provide smart home technologies and their benefits and challenges to users. Interviews were administered to 18 users of Smart Home technologies. The participants were selected randomly by purposive sampling on the basis of having and using a smart home technology, and with the goal of ascertaining which type of the technologies are being used, their modus operandi, and their benefits and any implementation issues. This was complemented by exploring the systems through watching and observing online videos of people using them. The findings reveal a varied number of Smart Home systems being used for automating household operations. The primary reasons for using them are their efficiency and simplicity of operation in spite of being challenged by their high costs. In relative order, the greatest perceived benefits of a smart home system for the participants were convenience, energy savings, the security it can provide, and simplicity of control. The greatest challenges were cost, design aspects, technical challenges and lacking in meeting special user needs.",

The new idea of the bathroom is shaped within the context of a changing population profile, which is impacting on the number of people requiring health care. The demands on health-friendly aspects in the bathroom environment are increasing along with health awareness and increasing interest for wellbeing. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a bathroom of various purposes and different characteristics. The integration of smart home technology to support health of users turns out to be necessary to achieve this goal. The purpose of this study is to present the bathroom as a place for healthcare by applying intelligent technology systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, in a bathroom space. For this reason, it is necessary to define the concept of intelligent bathroom and to demonstrate its potential for smart technology. An important issue in the study is the recognition of the current needs of users in terms of health and well-being manifested in the interest in using IoT technology in the bathroom space.",

abstract="With the implementation of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), comes the opportunity to gain valuable insights into an individual's daily habits, patterns and routines. A vital part of the AMI is the smart meter. It enables the monitoring of a consumer's electricity usage with a high degree of accuracy. Each device reports and records a consumer's energy usage readings at regular intervals. This facilitates the identification of emerging abnormal behaviours and trends, which can provide operative monitoring for people living alone with various health conditions. Through profiling, the detection of sudden changes in behaviour is made possible, based on the daily activities a patient is expected to undertake during a 24-h period. As such, this paper presents the development of a system which detects accurately the granular differences in energy usage which are the result of a change in an individual's health state. Such a process provides accurate monitoring for people living with self-limiting conditions and enables an early intervention practice (EIP) when a patient's condition is deteriorating. The results in this paper focus on one particular behavioural trend, the detection of sleep disturbances; which is related to various illnesses, such as depression and Alzheimer's. The results demonstrate that it is possible to detect sleep pattern changes to an accuracy of 95.96 {\%} with 0.943 for sensitivity, 0.975 for specificity and an overall error of 0.040 when using the VPC Neural Network classifier. This type of behavioral detection can be used to provide a partial assessment of a patient's wellbeing.",

Managing of these devices and their resources is a task for the underlying Fog technology that enables building of smart and efficient applications. Currently, the Fog is not implemented to the extent that we can submit application requirements to a Fog provider, select returned resources and deploy an application on them. A widely adopted workaround is to deploy Cloud applications that exploit the functionality of IoT and Fog devices. Although Clouds provide virtually unlimited computation power, they could present a bottleneck and unnecessary communication overhead when a huge number of devices needs to be controlled, read or written to. Therefore, it is reasonable to formulate use cases that will exploit the Edge and Fog functionality and define a set of basic requirements for Fog providers.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming one of hottest research topics. Elderly care is one of important applications in IoT, to grasp the situations around the elder people and then corresponding information can be sent to the care-givers to support the elder people. Abnormal activity detection is a particularly important task in the field, since the services should be immediately provided in such cases. Otherwise the elder people may be in danger. The existing approaches to this problem use some basic living patterns of the elder people, e.g. mobility per day, to detect abnormal activities. However, the detail abnormal activities in various specific situations cannot be detected, e.g., whether there is some abnormal activity when the elder people go to toilet, sleeps or eats something. To solve the above problem, in the paper, we propose a situation-aware abnormality detection system based on SVDD for the elder people. An experiment has been performed focusing on feasibility of the method and accuracy of the system to detect situations and abnormities from real sensors.",

Facilitating the control of household appliances and the home environment through various devices that encompass multimodal and ambient interfaces seems a way to achieve this. In this paper, we lay out the theoretical principles relating to the accommodation of technology for use in the home among older people, followed by a report supporting these principles based on experiments we have carried out. Three modalities of output -- audio, visual and multimodal -- were tested using two different devices -- palmtop and laptop -- as realistic prototypes of household appliance controllers. Through experimental design, the applicability of using icons and musical earcons as a medium to transmit information to the user and its suitability to the home was investigated. The use of musical earcons allowed the potential for an ambient interface to be compared with a traditional visual interface for older people. Results showed participants performed markedly better using the multimodal and visual interfaces than with the audio interface. In addition, both groups performed better using the palmtop as compared to the laptop.",

abstract="The focus of this paper is to determine whether, and to what extent, a relation exists between a kid-friendly urban space, social inclusiveness, and smart city paradigm. In fact, the practicability for vulnerable city users, such as children, acquires an intrinsic meaning of inclusion and equality, as a necessary condition to be considered and planned in a smart city. Over the years the city is based on the logic of separation and specialization of spaces and functions, so as to further differentiate the different social categories (adults, children, elderly and disabled people). In particular, children play and learn through urban space, developing and consolidating skills and competences. Children use urban space, expressing intents, idiorhythms and, therefore, specific needs. This paper proposes a phenomenological study, developed in the form of a laboratory of Cagliari's explorations, aimed at identifying the spatial, morphological and functional characters and elements of urban materials that determine children's perception and experience of places. The results of this research are a starting point for further studies aimed at integrating, with the parameters identified, the variables already considered in the existing tool for the measurement of the walkability of urban spaces.",

The chapter studies the global metropolitan cities development and shows how metro cities, megacities and meta-cities are emerging across the world in Asia, Africa, Europe and America. Metropolitan cities are continuously exposed to external economic stimuli and requires intermediate range strategies as responses to face it. These periodic challenges of cities call for differing and flexible spatial and economic strategies to intervene in emerging global situation. By and large such strategy making dynamics is rare to be found and it is an important gap which this book address. To face these emerging metropolitan challenges, there is a need to design economic and spatial strategies at the intermediate time horizon. Therefore, this chapter concludes with a critical analysis of economic and spatial design strategies of 17 metropolises in their official plans which of course is long range plans.",

Moreover, the potential of analytics methods for discovering activity recognition in such environment has been investigated. CASE easily allows to implement Smart Home applications exploiting a distributed multi-agent system and the cloud technology. The work is mainly focused on activity recognition albeit CASE architecture permits an easy integration of other kinds of smart home applications such as home automation and energy optimization.

New devices were developed to help the subjects with limitation in the activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), enhanced activities of daily living (EADL), and memory functions and health monitoring to remove the caregiver burden. To provide these requirements, we can use the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). We can improve the smart homes, the mobile devices, the wearable sensors, the smart fabrics, and the assistive robotics. Rehabilitation robotics (RR) and the assistive robotics (AA) are branches of robotics, which focus on devices or machines that can be developed to help people with disability to recover or to provide support in severe disability or physical trauma. These devices can be classified as exoskeleton, end effector, and wearable. All these robots are designed around the function and shape of the human body. Numerous robotic devices for the upper and lower limb with various levels of complexity and functionality have been developed. Prominent goals in this field include developing implementable technologies that can be easily used by patients, therapists, and clinicians, enhancing the efficacy of clinician's therapies, and increasing the ease of activities in the daily lives of patients. The development of robot-aided tools for geriatric rehabilitation is a very stimulating prospective when considering their highly rehabilitative and assistive potentials.",

abstract="Cognitive and physical functions gradually decline because of aging. To support healthy and safe living of elderly individuals, a system that can monitor their activities of daily living is needed. This paper proposes a handrail-shaped sensor as a new Internet of Things (IoT)-type sensing system for long-term monitoring of the mobility of elderly people. The handrail-shaped sensor detects changes in mobility using information on movement velocity and the degree of dependence on the handrail. To evaluate the effectiveness of the sensor, we first assessed the accuracy of estimating the position of the load applied to the handrail in our laboratory. We then field-tested the handrail sensor in the home of an 88-year-old woman. The experimental results show that the handrail sensor can estimate the walking speed as well as the grasping position of an elderly person in an actual daily living environment.",

abstract="Older patients, frequently suffering from multiple chronic diseases, tend to have difficulty in using injectables, patches, eye droppers, nebulizers, inhalers and more complex devices, since such administration devices often require challenging preparatory, administration and disposal steps. Preventing user error is important, especially in the case of critical errors affecting the outcome of the treatment. Prescribers can employ the therapeutic trinity tool to discuss and select the optimal administration option for their older patients; depending upon the choice, prescribers may need to test the older patients for cognitive and physical ability to properly handle the device.

Strict adherence to regulatory requirements for the development of drug/device combination products, such as applying design control and risk management under a suitable quality management system, is essential for obtaining a finished administration device with acceptable safety and the desired performance in older patients. This includes usabilityUsabilityand human factorsHuman factorsstudies of both prototype and finalized device designs, performed in environments simulating those of home and domiciliary care.

Far from being able to gaze that far ahead in the future, it's clear from the past hundred years that some things may stay the same but be experienced differently. The idea of the home as a private space has been complicated by a variety of ``always on'' appliances, selling us services instead of products. Middle class and wealthy households in the West might miss the days of in-house servants and emulate their presence by using voice assistants and on-demand services supported by the so-called ``gig economy.'' Culturesare also looking to new technologies to create a collectively agreeable view of what ``good'' home living entails. We are always trying to get a peek through the curtains and understand how we compare to others when it comes to the ways we live, and new technologies will continue to support home owners in that quest to ``keep up with the Jones'.''

abstract="The elderly population is steadily increasing in most countries due to a decline in birth and mortality rate. The population of independently living senior citizens has also become significant. This has led to an active research focus in geriatric wellness. Apart from the usual physical and cognitive decline that proceeds with age, there are much softer aspects like dignity and ability to live independently (age-in-place). If we monitor the subject all the time by instrumenting them heavily, technology can possibly predict and prevent many abnormal situations. However, this curbs the idea of independent living. Hence, while instrumenting and monitoring is an important paradigm in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), the need for the underlying technology to be non-intrusive or as natural as possible is also pressing. For example, passive infrared (PIR) sensors are quite effective and ubiquitous in detecting presence and movement. In this paper we investigate the opportunities in this sliding balance of intrusiveness versus wellness. We explore ubiquitous and pervasive monitoring to make useful inferences in the subject's activities of daily living (ADL). To this end, we evaluate different type of commercially available sensors such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect{\$}{\$}^{\backslash}mathrm{\{}TM{\}}{\$}{\$}TM, video cameras and smart watches, which will augment the PIR sensors at home. Each sensor will allow the elderly to be monitored for specific wellness parameters. We propose a generic framework with algorithms developed in-house, highlighting the use of the Kinect for computing fall-risk through single limb stand (SLS) and postural stability, smart watches to detect multiple activities in an energy efficient manner using in-built sensors, and, finally, computer-vision based methods using video cameras to detect the liveliness of human beings by computing the micro motions of the body during sleep. These findings can be used for both early risk assessment and cognitive training of an individual. Our framework is also extensible to allow the integration of various sensors and algorithms in addition to being customizable for the context in question. A key challenge in building such a generic wellness care framework to support multiple sensor measurements, is handling the trade-off between cost, intrusiveness, and precision.",

The three core components are Smart City Foundation, Smart ICT and Smart Institutions and Laws, which in turn are the pillars of the seven dimensions of a smart city: Infrastructure Development, Environmental Sustainability, Social Development, Social Inclusion, Disasters Exposure, Resilience and Peace and Security. The three components together with the seven dimensions make a Smart Economy. This chapter focuses on one of the dimensions of smart cities, the Social Development which is composed of elements of education, health, social inclusion, social capital, population dynamics and other variables. The first section of this chapter is on Education, which is critical to meeting the challenges of smart city, as it connects people to new approaches, solutions and technologies that enable them to identify, clarify and tackle local and global problems. The second section on health considering that healthy population is critical to realizing economic growth through increased productivity. Healthy workers are more productive, bringing greater income to families and higher levels of economic growth for nations, and then enhance. When education and health are combined, they contribute significantly to human development. In both dimensions, the agglomeration has Dakar as the rest of Senegal has made significant progress during these past twenty years. With the decline in fertility and mortality rates, the population of Dakar is marked by a massive youth population (with a median age of 23.2 years) that constitute a potential urban demographic dividend which is the focus of the third section. However, due to high unemployment rates, this demographic dividend has not been fully utilized; most young people are still depend to their parents, thanks to the high social capital in Dakar as in the rest of Senegal.

Thus, monitoring important daily activities through the observation of everyday object usages is one way to let medical personnel know about the activities of the elderly, and, if there is a problem, a nurse or doctor can adequately respond in a timely fashion. The elderly people can be monitored continuously in their own home with the set-up of an AAL environment.

This remote patient's monitoring is becoming more feasible as specialized sensors can be placed inside homes. In fact, wireless sensor network are used to collect medical data such as vital signs and personal data to transmit it to the caregiver. Therefore, the preserving security and privacy of this sensitive information is very crucial. This is particularly challenging because of the specific characteristics of WSN (e.g. limited resources: energy, storage, computation, communication) and the specific smart home environment.

Yet, the local set-up and configuration still is overly complex, especially for non-technical users. In this paper, we present a remote management platform that focuses on ease of configuration and installation. It allows monitoring, configuration, diagnostics and service provisioning without manual intervention of a technical person. The platform reacts on local changes such as the installation of a new device or state changes of discovered services.

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is opening a large set of opportunities for things to make part of the processes that monitor our industries, support our decisions and control our lives. For that kind of power things must be reliable, i.e., they have to be able to handle on their own, without human interaction, means to still deliver when faults are detected. This work presents an approach that aims to increase the reliability and trust of constrained IoT devices in the effort of pushing the technology further and increase its usability in the application scenarios that IoT is supposed for. It will also be integrated in European Union's Horizon 2020 C2NET project, as an essential key in the monitoring of pilots production lines.",

abstract="Effective implementation and evaluation of development projects depends on access to accurate, complete, and timely information about the outcomes of project implementation. We explore the proposition that next-generation ICTs offer solutions for development actors operating in decentralised and extremely low-power environments to improve data collection, monitoring, and project feedback. This paper describes the potential integration of novel distributed monitoring technologies and techniques within the health sector in developing countries, and in particular the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for monitoring widely distributed projects in areas with little or no infrastructure. We discuss the application of an emerging low-power wide area networking technology, LoRa, which is ideally suited to resource-limited contexts due to its low cost, low power usage, and long range. We describe our experiences in implementing a pilot project carried out in Kikwit, DR Congo to develop a LoRa-based wireless network to track the temperature of blood products, ensuring their security and viability through a decentralised, low-power, and low-cost monitoring system.",

Healthcare moves into people's homes and merges medical devices with services hereby enlarging the current contrast between medical device cleanliness and the often cozier and textile-rich home environment. These developments bring important design challenges that will be addressed in this chapter, thereby raising important questions for the implementation of a new design perspective on healthcare.",

Wireless short-range personal area networks based on IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) or IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) standards are used in wearable body networks for communication. Moreover, the antennas using in wireless body area network (WBAN) must take in consideration the specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions on human body for electronic devices. For our research, we have chosen the star topology with a main board---central node and other sensors placed at a distance of different radii (owing to the need to be in correspondence with the anatomical region to be measured). The Wireless Bluetooth technology based on mesh network will enable the IoT because it allows for data transfer between biomedical sensors and the gateway.",

Currently the ability to supply the industry with engineering graduates and staff that have an up-to-date and relevant competences might be considered as a challenge for the society. In this paper an education approach is presented where academia - industry - research institutes cooperate around the development and implementation of master level courses. The methods applied to reach the educational goals, concerning expert competence within remote diagnostics, have been on site and remote lectures given by engineering, medical and metrology experts. The pedagogical approach utilized has been flipped classroom. The main results show that academic courses developed in cooperation with industry requires flexibility, time and effort from the involved partners. The evaluation interviews indicate that student are satisfied with the courses and pedagogical approach but suggests more reconciliation meetings for course development. Labs early in the course was considered good, and division of labs at the system and the component level. However further long-term studies of evaluation of impact is necessary.",

abstract="The aging of population in recent years and the increase in life expectancy is raising challenges for finding new ways to guarantee healthy and controlled activities for the elderly. Most of them prefer living in their houses than in a community center, even if they live alone or isolated from their family; at home, their normal routine activities and comfort makes them feel well. In this paper, an Active and Assisted Living (AAL) solution to detect irregular situations in everyday life of the elderly living alone is presented. By using low-cost sensors in an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture we aim to gather data in specific areas of an elderly's house in order to give the system enough input to detect abnormal behavior. These sensors are non-intrusive to the elderly, do not disturb them, and do not force them to wear a device at all times. These sensors can also send information to edge computing devices that analyze the data in real time using machine learning algorithms and alert family or caretakers when an unusual situation arises. The proposed solution provides a system that monitors the main activities performed by the elderly and creates patterns based on that activity to achieve its results and is scalable in terms of sensors and data input.",

We set out to write this paper, and try to answer these questions by using the Internet of Postal Things as case study. Our focus is the smart mailbox, a general purpose mailbox, that can be shared, monitored, and monetized using Internet of Things and blockchain technologies. Blockchain technologies provide a distributed shared ledger in a heterogeneous environment and thus the link in the Internet of Things technology stack for proof and trust. However, blockchain technologies are not to render existing database and security solutions irrelevant.

These parameters can range from status of their education and employment possibilities, available utilities for citizens, transportation information, energy consumption information, health-related issues, water and air quality monitoring, waste management, and other relevant information that potentially benefit the community. Smart city is regarded as the future direction of urban development. Some applications of smart city are as follows: (1) Make public service to become more intelligent. (2) Make urban traffic to become more convenient. (3) Ensure Internet security. The key technologies of smart city include city-level smart operation framework, city-wide sensing infrastructure, M2M telecommunication, and city open data. These technologies will promote the development and evolution of smart city. Therefore, mining mobile data and understanding the underlying mobile Internet lifestyle are applications of smart city and also provide direction for the development of smart city.",

abstract="The SUMMIT project funded by the Italian MISE under the PON2020 Action, aims to the development a IoT (Internet of Things) platform which should be flexible and adaptive to easily embed several smart objects such as sensors, multi-sensor architectures and mobile terminals. The main idea is to lunch an open and dynamic eco-system to support the development of IoT based services both for the private and public sectors. The concept of ``pattern'' will lead the overall development of the SUMMIT platform which represents each element to be integrated in the SUMMIT framework by assuring security, privacy and dependability properties. Above patterns will be also self-evolving on the basis of their behavioral analysis to be performed during the system operation. The three main cases of study addressed by the project will be smart energy, smart health and smart cities. Among patterns addressed by the project the development of a smart inertial platform is considered. Such platform will find application in several contexts with a strong priority in the Smart Living framework. As an example, the architecture developed can be adopted for the sake of Activity of Daily Living monitoring (including Falls), postural instability detection, aided navigation, physical activity assessment, just to cite mostly addressed needs. Actually, above application contexts represent serious needs to be addressed to enable Active Ageing and Well Being. The Smart Inertial Pattern (SIP) is based on an embedded architecture equipped with sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass) and communication facilities. In this paper the use of the SIP device for the implementation of a ADL classifier exploiting an event correlated approach is presented.",

abstract="With the increased success of Internet of Things (IoT), the conventional centralized cloud computing is encountering severe challenges (e.g., high latency, non-adaptive machine type of communication), that proved insufficient to meet the stringent requirements of IoT applications. Besides requiring fast response time, increased security and privacy, they lack computational resources at the edge of the network. Motivated to solve these challenges, new technologies are driving a trend that distributes the computational resources and shifts the function of centralized cloud computing to the edge. Several edge computing technologies, edge and fog paradigms, originating from different backgrounds have been emerging to overweight these challenges. However, to fully utilize these limited devices, we need advanced resource management techniques. In this paper, we present a novel distributed resource allocation algorithm with the purpose of enabling seamless integration and deployment of different applications in an IoT infrastructure. The algorithm decides: (i) the mapping of an IoT application at the edge of the network; (ii) dynamic migration of parts of the application, such that Service Level Agreement (SLA) is satisfied. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss our approach and the potential to minimize the latency of different IoT applications.",

We describe the considerations that were made towards a first prototype from a technical perspective. An interaction model was developed, a requirements analysis performed and several design and development considerations made. An architecture shows the information flow between sensors, actuators, and the Internet of Things.

Innovative technologies such as three-dimensional printing (3DP), have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in medicine design, manufacture and use. Instead of using conventional large batch processes, customised printlets (3D printed tablets) with a tailored dose, shape, size and release characteristics could be produced on-demand. Arguably, never before has the pharmaceutical industry experienced such a transformative technology in medicines manufacture. Indeed, this technology could be utilised throughout the drug development process, ranging from pre-clinical development and first-in-human clinical trials through to front-line medical care (personalized medicines).

Key data and findings are collected from own questionnaire investigation and interviews with the municipality, directors of elementary schools, teachers, pupils and attendees which were conducted during computer courses for elderly people. Results and recommendations will be used for the next run of courses that are organized twice a year by municipality in cooperation with primary schools. The biggest ratio of participants can use the Internet followed by email and Skype. MS Excel and Instagram represent the smallest ratio of applications that pupils can use. All other followed applications are used by more than 85{\%}.

abstract="This chapter addresses placemaking as a technique for developing civic pluralism. Municipal authorities face increased governance challenges when diverse groups flow into cities with established populations. The new groups, treated as `other', may not be seen as part of the unfolding heritage in the life of a city. Physical segmentation and alienation can cause differences to be violently expressed on the grounds of religion, ethnicity, and perceptions of the right of possession. The Internet of Things (IoT) can create enriched experiences of urban heritage through its capacity to connect people and material objects in multiple, interactive ways. The chapter argues through illustrations, and an account of the design of research, that open, purposeful and technologically-enabled placemaking can facilitate a civic pluralism which is experiential, interactive and free from authoritatively monocultural majoritarianism in both assumptions and values. Designing pluralist heritage informatics and civic memorialization practices means re-purposing existing in situ heritage experiences, creating new ones available for self-curation, and collective production through free municipal wifi and high mobile connectivity. The IoT, in connecting unique urban waypoints and access to public resources, can contribute to multi-layered, individuated narratives of the city, which are designed to assist in the governance of differences.",

abstract="In this research we examine the generation specific acceptance motives of eHealth technologies in order to assess the likelihood of success for these new technologies. 280 participants (14 - 92 years of age) volunteered to participate in a survey, in which using motives and barriers toward smart home technologies were explored. The scenario envisaged was the use of a medical stent implemented into the body, which monitors automatically the health status and which is able to remotely communicate with the doctor. Participants were asked to evaluate the pros and cons of the usage of this technology, their acceptance motives and potential utilization barriers. In order to understand the complex nature of acceptance, personal variables (age, technical expertise, health status), individual's cognitive concepts toward ageing as well as perceived usefulness were related. Outcomes show that trust, believe in the reliability of technology, privacy and security as well as intimacy facets are essential for acceptance and should be considered in order to proactively design a successful rollout of smart home technologies.",

abstract="An organised and efficient e-land management ensures full participation of citizen and various governmental agencies in the activity of urban land management and can play a large role in making a smart economy. Umami is a `smart city' created within Kozhikode with a smart economy that markets the foods of Kozhikode. The spatial location of Umami mainly comprises of a food processing zone and allied living areas. The idea of e-land management is practiced and found successful in many cities worldwide, but such an idea is conceptualised for the first time in Kerala through this chapter. Little management beyond acquisitions and few not so successful land pooling and readjustment are seen in Kozhikode. Master planning approach and lack of transparency and hence inefficiency and corruption are the cause of failed land management in the city. The Kerala Town and Country Planning Act 2016 is a welcome gesture to the unused potential of land markets in Kozhikode. Recognising the strengths of urban land, it welcomes a variety of land management practices found successful in other states of India, yet to be applied in Kerala. It is realised through the successful and failed land management cases in the history of the state that public participation and transparency are two buzzwords for a success story. E-land management through a website opens up the land market for the participation of citizen and ensures transparency in the process. Opening up of the land market implies that a website provides information and opportunity to all citizens to financially benefit by opting land management of their holdings. This is illustrated in this chapter by an exploratory study of the smart city of Umami in Kozhikode. Firstly, a zonal plan is prepared for Umami considering the principles and needs of a smart city. E-land management is the method to achieve that zonal plan. The various land management tools permitted in Kerala are identified and studied. Depending on the tools, areas are identified for each tool. The opportunity for public participation is created through the website. Monetary benefit of taking part in e-land management is informed to the public, hence giving them the freedom to decide, but also in a way moulding public decision to the interest of the zonal plan. This ensures that no decision is forced on the public, but what public decides for them happens in a way the zonal plan expects and hence direct towards a smart economy. The objective of this chapter is to showcase the e-land management website which makes land management market-driven and successful, hence a process in a `smart economy'.",

Energy is one of the city domains where learning and cognitive systems are needed. This chapter reviews Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based energy management solutions developed to improve city energy efficiency, sustainability and resilience. The review focuses on learning and cognitive solutions that improve energy sustainability and resilience through Semantic Web technologies. In addition, these solutions are evaluated from level of acceptance and use of semantics perspectives. The evaluation highlights that the Cognitive City approach is in the early stages in the energy domain and demonstrates the need for a standard energy ontology.",

abstract="In recent years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have attracted a considerable attention from both academia and industry. There is a number of possible applications and great expectations, but at the same time there are some serious issues and challenges related to Wireless Sensor Networks. One of the areas of WSN applications is healthcare and there are a number of health related issues that WSN aims to address. Amongst the main such issues are: the aging population that causes a growing pressure on economy and the healthcare system supported by a declining number of working-age people as well as an increase in chronic diseases, which includes obesity frequently attributed to a lack of fitness and weight management due to busy lifestyles. Staying physically and mentally healthy is of the greatest importance to every individual and to the society. There is a growing interest in a new approaches to the support of the overstressed healthcare system. The fundamental concept is to shift some of the responsibilities from the clinicians, health centres and hospitals of the traditional system to the patients and their home environment. People themselves are able and should play a greater role in monitoring and maintaining their own health, provided that they are supported by an adequate technology and have a proper knowledge of how to use it. There are already a number of applications of computing and communication technologies related to healthcare including (but not limited to) the pervasive health monitoring, mobile telemedicine applications, the intelligent emergency management services, health aware mobile devices, the medical inventory management, the pervasive access to health information and the lifestyle management . In this chapter, we discuss a several of new generation of services and applications in the area of pervasive and ubiquitous healthcare that are enabled by sensor networks. We shall provide an overview of the new trends and introduce innovative ideas around the self-adapting ambient intelligence combined with specialised system requirements.",

abstract="Growing popularity of wireless sensor network (WSN) applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication has recently led to emergence of a new class of network traffic. The communication between things introduces network traffic characteristics very different from traditional human-centric communication. As more WSN and M2M services are expected to use mobile network as a backhaul, it is important to understand the impact that their traffic will have on the radio access network. WCDMA radio access networks are dimensioned using traffic models containing traffic characteristics for a number of services offered by the operators and their networks today. In this chapter, the potential capacity impact of several selected sensor-based applications on the WCDMA radio access network, both dedicated and common channels, is presented. The results thus far have shown that currently 3G mobile networks can successfully cope with the new WSN traffic. With the increase of WSN traffic, optimizations of protocols and solutions will be required and radio bearer mapping can be a deciding factor in determining the size of the radio access network and the required resources.",

Therefore, the modelling and simulation of a LiDAR sensor networks is also included in this chapter that is structured as follows. First, a brief description of the theoretical modelling of the mathematical principle of operation is outlined. Subsequently, a review of the state-of-the-art of computational intelligence techniques in sensor system simulations is explained. Likewise, a use case of applying computational intelligence techniques to LiDAR sensor networks in a Cyber-Physical System environment is presented. In this use case, a model library with four specific artificial intelligence-based methods is also designed based on sensory information database provided by the LiDAR simulation. Some of them are multi-layer perceptron neural network, a self-organization map, a support vector machine, and a k-nearest neighbour. The results demonstrate the suitability of using computational intelligence methods to increase the reliability of sensor networks when addressing the key challenges of safety and security in automotive applications.",

This paper describes the combination of the smartwatch-based Happimeter with City4Age data capture technology. Through measuring the mood of the wearer of the smartwatch, a signal is transmitted to the Philips Hue platform, enabling mood-controlled lighting. Philips Hue allows the wireless remote control of energy-efficient LED light bulbs. Thus, measuring the mood through the Happimeter, the living environment for elderly people can be dynamically adapted. We anticipate that by changing colors and brightness of light bulbs using the Philips Hue platform, their quality of life can be improved.

abstract="The last two decades show that population is continuously and gradually aging; in Italy, the percentage of over-sixties has increased since 1980 by more than 50 {\%} while the over-eighties by more than 150 {\%}. Aging causes a consequent psycho-physical decline which in many cases requires specific care and precautions by relatives. However, as can be easily inferable from the percentage of elderly just shown, today the national health-care systems are not able to manage and take charge of all these elders. More and more seniors are choosing to live alone, with all the problems related to emergencies and urgencies cases that can occur due to poor health status related to aging (falls, cardiovascular events, neurological events). In this case, providing health-care initiates to have its new challenges. One of the worst possible case of emergency in elderly living alone is bad injury within the home without the possibility for seeking a help. This paper presents a work related to this issue; project SMARTA, focused on biomedical and environmental monitoring for the active aging. The project is based on the use of biomedical sensors and sensorized garments for health status and cardio-monitoring, and accelerometers fixed on the floor for activity and fall detection. All this sensors are integrated in a system that is used for monitoring elderly both indoor and outdoor during their daily life thanks also to the connection over the Internet.",

abstract="Enabling technologies for the Internet of Things are well understood, and open standards exist that define how to use the Internet Protocol, Version 6, (IPv6) to interconnect smart objects with each other and to the public Internet. As these devices typically are quite limited in their hardware resources, security is often considered too expensive and is sacrificed for a marginal extension of battery lifetime. Missing security not only exposes the application logic to evildoers but also affects management functions. In this paper, we discuss potential threats to machine-to-machine communication and provide a detailed example how protection requirements can be inferred from a given application scenario.",

abstract="The key to any smart city begins with a focused planning process. This effort, if conducted properly, has only a single purpose. This is to define on a collective basis the current situation of a city and where it wants to go in the near, medium and longer term. Personal experience with smart city planning has indicated that cities do not change overnight. It takes hard and dedicated work and continuity of purpose. The Danish city of Copenhagen began planning to become free of dependence on petroleum and energy resilient in the 1970s when a severe oil shortage drove planning in this direction. They now expect to fully reach their goal of a zero-carbon footprint as of 2025, but it has taken some five decades of effort to reach this objective.",

abstract="In the framework of Ambient Assisted Living, home automation may be a solution for helping elderly people living alone at home. This study is part of the Sweet-Home project which aims at developing a new home automation system based on voice command to improve support and well-being of people in loss of autonomy. The goal of the study is vocal order recognition with a focus on two aspects: distance speech recognition and sentence spotting. Several ASR techniques were evaluated on a realistic corpus acquired in a 4-room flat equipped with microphones set in the ceiling. This distant speech French corpus was recorded with 21 speakers who acted scenarios of activities of daily living. Techniques acting at the decoding stage, such as our novel approach called Driven Decoding Algorithm (DDA), gave better speech recognition results than the baseline and other approaches. This solution which uses the two best SNR channels and a priori knowledge (voice commands and distress sentences) has demonstrated an increase in recognition rate without introducing false alarms. Generally speaking, a short overview allows then to outline the research challenges that speech technologies must take up for Ambient Assisted Living and Augmentative and Alternative Communication, and the current reseach avenues in this domain.",

In this paper, the PLC-utilized remote power metering and monitoring and control of power usages of respective power supplies have been implemented for the system. In addition, In-home headcount monitoring algorithm is proposed in an attempt to achieve efficient power usage management. It is expected that the proposed foundation technology will eventually become a foundation technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). We also anticipate that the technology could be useful for the establishment of an adequate power saving scheme with continuous power usage monitoring and will provide better user-convenience by controlling the power remotely and efficiently. Furthermore, since it provides relatively easy addition or removal of devices within the household, the system will have wider scalability.",

abstract="The ability to efficiently predict the elderly's future situations and make the right decision accordingly is a necessity in developing smart homes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and dynamic predictive model which utilizes higher order Markov models integrated with a situation ranking technique. More specifically, we employ a revised version of PageRank algorithm to take the properties of the situation-graph (structure and semantics) into account and dynamically rank the situations considering the user's mental state. Then we apply rankings as prior probabilities in order to build the corresponding Markov model. Also, we utilize rankings to identify milestone situations and transitions in order to compress the representation model. Experiments show that the predictions obtained by this approach are more efficient and effective than the ones produced from the pure predictive graphical model-based approaches.",

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) enabled in a smart home requires, the design of an activity recognition system. Generally, supervised machine learning strategies or knowledge engineering strategies are employed in the process of activity modeling. Supervised machine learning approaches incur overheads in annotating the dataset, while the knowledge modeling approaches incur overhead by being dependent on the domain expert for occupant specific knowledge. The proposed approach on the other hand, employs an unsupervised machine learning strategy to readily extract knowledge from unlabelled data and subsequently represents it as ontology activity model. The novelty in the proposed design is in the usage of Contextual Pattern Clustering (CPC) for activity modeling. The competence of the weighted Jaro Winkler similarity measure introduced in CPC lies in the utilization of contextual attributes for the composition of varied event patterns of an activity. Hierarchical strategy employed in CPC offers structured knowledge on activities and sub activities within a specific location. Additionally, the event organizer and habitual event generator subsystem introduced in the proposed framework derives knowledge related to event ordering and contextual description of an activity. The attained knowledge is later represented as a probabilistic ontology activity model to enable probabilistic reasoning over domain knowledge. An experimental analysis with a smart home dataset demonstrates the proficiency of the proposed unsupervised approach in activity modeling and recognition in comparison with that of the existing modeling strategies.",

abstract="Historically, Kozhikode was a port city and a global trading hub connecting Europe and South Asia. The subsequent political and social fabric prevalent during the post---independence period resulted in the city losing its erstwhile economic significance. Industrial and economic activity is now limited to few medium and small scale industries that are neither a major source of revenue nor employment. Economic decline, high growth of unemployment and increasing migration rates has made it important to reconsider economic strategies to transform Kozhikode. For the purpose of this study, the Kozhikode Metropolitan Region has been delineated to ensure that the area is unified by economic activities, labour markets and firms within a single administrative boundary. In this chapter we aim to study the existing economic and spatial structure of the place and propose economic and spatial strategies that can be adapted to revive the economy for a delineated metropolitan region within the district. The economic and subsequent spatial strategies for the region have been formulated based on the principles of the Third Industrial Revolution and Zero Marginal Cost Society, proposed by Jeremy Rifkin all within the framework of the sharing economy system. The fundamental principle of trust---which is the basis of sharing economy---has been integrated to further integrate the community of the metropolitan region for the implementation of the various strategies. In line with this, faith based models, which were practiced by the various communities in Kozhikode since centuries for community and social development, have also been explored for the benefit of the community.",

abstract="The smart fridge has often been considered a prototypical example of applications of the Internet of Things for the home. However, very little research has been conducted on functions desired by prospective users, and how users will eventually use the fridge. A simulation of a smart fridge was developed and tested within a controlled laboratory between-subjects experiment with 105 participants. Four different assistance functions were tested. It was found that generally a smart fridge is evaluated as moderately useful, easy to use and people would tend to buy it, if it was already available. Emotional responses differed between the assistance functions. Displaying information on durability of products, as well as giving feedback on nutrition health and economics are the most appreciated applications. Structurally, overall usefulness ratings of the device are the strongest predictors for the intention to use a smart fridge, but the emotional response to the product was also an important explanatory variable. Results are not influenced by technical competence, gender, or sense of presence in the simulation. Regression models confirmed that the simulation-based results explained 20{\%} more variance in product acceptance than written scenarios. An outlook is given on future questions to be answered using the simulation.",

abstract="Rapid technological advances and new models of aging highlight the potential of smart homes to support older adults and promote independence. A ``smart home'' is a residential setting with embedded technological features that enable passive monitoring of the well-being and activities of their residents aiming to improve primarily overall quality of life, to detect or even prevent emergencies and ultimately increase independence for the involved residents. Efforts to design, implement and evaluate such systems have been underway for several years now, targeting specifically older adults or people with disabilities or the general population. This chapter reviews existing smart home initiatives for healthy aging that utilize diverse sets of technologies (e.g., cameras, motion sensors, radio frequency identifiers) and serve various goals (e.g., monitor mobility, detect emergencies). We discuss ethical and practical considerations and outline the gaps in current scientific evidence and future trends.",

The present study evaluated preferences for different video-based medical monitoring scenarios, which comprised the attributes medical safety (improved detection of medical emergencies), privacy (handling of video information), type and location of camera in a conjoint analysis. Medical safety was identified as key driver for preferences. Acceptance for video-based medical monitoring systems in public places was comparably high, given that privacy was protected. In contrast, acceptance for video-based monitoring in smart home environments was rather low due to privacy concerns. Based on the findings, recommendation for AAL system design and implementation were derived.",

abstract="Medical treatment, lost work or productivity, and health care costs are significant burdens to the economy, families, and businesses. Preventive healthcare encourages health and averts disease or injuries by addressing factors that lead to the inception of a disease, and by detecting dormant conditions to reduce or cessation their progression. Preventive healthcare reduces the significant economic burden of disease in addition to improving the length and quality of outpatients' lives. Machine Learning (ML) Infused Preventive Healthcare goes one step ahead by application of algorithms for collection of multi-scale clinical, biomedical, contextual, and environmental data about each outpatient (e.g., in Electronic Health Record (EHR)s, personal health records - PHR, etc.), unified and extensibility of metadata standards, and decision support tools to facilitate optimized patient-centered, evidence-based decisions. Through interweaving data, importantly, from traditional healthcare data sources such as outpatient Electronic Health Records (EHR) and revolutionary data sources such as mobile, voice and sensor generated outpatient contextual and lifestyle data, the machine learning (ML) infused preventive health care breeds new clinical pathways that are not only beneficial to the individual outpatients but can also improve overall population safety and health outcomes. In this research paper, we propose machine learning infused preventive health care and aims to solve one of the most important issues in the outpatient elderly healthcare ``prevention of injuries and outpatient caring''. Finally, the paper presents a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.",

In this chapter, we describe motivations and opportunities for applying case-based reasoning (CBR) to a human-centered approach to the capture, sharing, and revision of knowledge for smart homes. Starting from the CBR cognitive model of reasoning and learning, we illustrate how CBR could provide useful capabilities for problem detection and response, provide a basis for personalization and learning, and provide a paradigm for home-human communication to cooperatively guide performance improvement. After sketching how these capabilities could be served by case-based reasoning, we discuss some design issues for applying CBR within smart homes and case-based reasoning research challenges for realizing the vision.",

abstract="It goes without saying that the developed world is facing significant challenges in dealing with the increasing demands of an ageing population, especially around health and care. It is also easy to understand why technology is seen as a key enabler for meeting this challenge. Application areas such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and telecare are receiving increasing governmental, industry and research attention, taking advantage of maturing and increasingly ubiquitous wireless, mobile and sensor-based technologies. However, to date, many of these advances have been largely driven by technology-utopian visions without real understanding for how such technologies come to be situated in everyday life and healthcare practice and what their potential is for enhancing new ways of living into older age. Further, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness to date, and the problems with adoption from the patients' perspectives suggest it is timely to reflect on these experiences and reimagine new ways of approaching AAL/telecare from a broader socio-technical perspective. To this end, we propose AAL/telecare as modular infrastructures for the home that can be adapted and repurposed, starting with personal `quality of life' and social needs (supporting peer care) and progressing to monitoring, physical and medical needs (supporting formal care) as relevant for a person and as needs evolve. This extends the adoption path to supporting healthy ageing, taking notions of agency, adaptivity and social reciprocity as core principles. We illustrate this with some examples and identify some of the associated technical and methodological challenges.",

Both cities have made significant investments in libraries over the last decade, and both have linked these investments to city-led digital and smart city strategies. Through interviews with professional library staff, and a review of the policy documents, marketing material and media reporting on these developments, we draw out different visions of how libraries are understood to contribute to the smart city. This situated, ethnographic account provides a glimpse of the embodied realities behind the rhetoric of libraries in the smart city, revealing some of the tensions and opportunities this strategy represents. Our fieldwork reveals how ideals of the library as free, inviting spaces---the heart of their communities---sit sometimes uncomfortably alongside ambitions that they will be engines of innovation in the knowledge economy.",

Mobility has a considerable impact on cities and the regions which contain them. ``Smart cities'' are expected to promote denser city centres where not only private car needs are taken into account. Decision-making is crucial for boosting social cohesion and inclusiveness through the right social appropriation of technological progress. The Spanish region of Navarra and its capital city Pamplona are currently experiencing profound transformations which aim at integrating ``smart city''-related innovations. In spite of the central relevance of the automobile industry for its economy, Pamplona is making efforts for consolidating alternatives to its private car-centred mobility. Intermodal transportation options offer a more sustainable and socially inclusive mobility-paradigm. This paper incorporates an analysis of the narratives and discourses of some of the key stakeholders in play, such as politicians, transportation experts and engineers. Their main viewpoints are examined from a sociological approach as they could predict new collective trends valid not only for this mid-size city but also for many analogous cases.",

abstract="The phenomenon of ageing population is raising substantial pressure to the national health and welfare systems of many countries in the world, and can be a potential threat to social stability and economic development. IoT wearable medical technologies have the potential to aid this struggle, but anecdotal evidence showed that large-scale deployment of IoT wearable devices among the ageing population could be fraught with challenges, which have not been well reported in academic literature. Therefore, this paper aims to address this knowledge gap by reporting on an exploratory study that firstly investigated older people's user requirements towards wearable medical devices and secondly explored potential challenges and difficulties for large-scale deployment of such devices. Five focus groups were conducted to collect insights and opinions respectively from five families (i.e. each contained 1--2 elderly members, accompanied with 2--4 family members who held caring responsibilities). The data collected was analyzed by using a thematic analysis approach. The results showed that elderly people have complicated and diverse user requirements towards IoT wearable medical devices, and that a range of challenges related to hardware providers, caregivers, legal regulations and technical features can affect large-scale deployment of such devices. The paper concluded that these identified user requirements and challenges should be carefully considered by wearable hardware designers, system developers, and service providers if they want their innovative products and services to be accepted and deployed among the ageing population globally.",

By using the smart home/assistant robot as sensing equipment for health monitoring, we mask the functionality of the sensors rather than the sensors themselves.

abstract="Many wonderful technological developments in recent years have opened up the possibility of using smart or intelligent homes for a number of important applications. Typical applications range from overall lifestyle improvement to helping people with special needs such as the elderly and the disabled to improve their independence, safety and security at home. Research in the area has looked into ways of making the home environment automatic and automated devices have been designed to help the disabled people. Also, possibilities of automated health monitoring systems and usage of automatic controlled devices to replace caregiver and housekeeper have received significant attention. Most of the models require acquisition of useful information from the environment, identification of the significant features and finally usage of some sort of machine learning techniques for decision making and planning for the next action to be undertaken. This chapter specifically focuses on neural networks applications in building a smart home environment.",

abstract="The paper presents the outline and the preliminary developments of NINFA (iNtelligent Integrated Network For Aged people), a project for the well-being of the elderly people at home. This architecture is based on a service platform suited for elder people called the Virtual Village Network, whose user interface allows to deliver different services at home, namely: user supervision, communication and interaction among users for social inclusion, exergame delivering, monitoring of the wellness status. After the discussion of some results of the investigation on the acceptability issues of the ICT technologies related to the project, the User Interface (UI) and the novel Human Computer Interface (HCI) have been developed. The HCI is particularly suited for elderly people and motor impaired patients because the interaction is managed only by finger/hand gestures and by vocal control through simple commands. A set of preliminary exergames developed for the user training and monitoring are presented. During the exergame execution, the user interface allows the real-time acquisition of a set of motor, linguistic and cognitive parameters related to the user performance. The analysis of the verbal production of each subject is used to observe its language evolution and to detect the onset of any cognitive deficit. The relationship between some parameters and the neurological/wellness status of the user is discussed.",

abstract="Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. One of the problems of interest is this of monitoring the activities of daily living (ADLs) of the elderly aiming at their protection and well-being. In this work, we present our initial efforts to automatically recognize ADLs using multimodal input from audio-visual sensors. For this purpose, and as part of Integrated Project Netcarity, far-field microphones and cameras have been installed inside an apartment and used to collect a corpus of ADLs, acted by multiple subjects. The resulting data streams are processed to generate perception-based acoustic features, as well as human location coordinates that are employed as visual features. The extracted features are then presented to Gaussian mixture models for their classification into a set of predefined ADLs. Our experimental results show that both acoustic and visual features are useful in ADL classification, but performance of the latter deteriorates when subject tracking becomes inaccurate. Furthermore, joint audio-visual classification by simple concatenative feature fusion significantly outperforms both unimodal classifiers.",

abstract="This chapter, written from a public health and technology perspective, addresses limited or impaired mobility, which is common in adults---particularly older adults---and adversely associated with health, well-being, and function. Little attention has been given to problems with community wayfinding, including both individual characteristics (such as reduced lower-body strength, vision impairment, and cognitive deficits) and environmental characteristics (such as broken sidewalks, poor lighting, and heavy automobile traffic) and their potential impact on older adult mobility. Given that improving mobility is a key foundation block for any comprehensive program to enhance the health and well-being of older adults, the chapter explores the potential of current and emerging personal wayfinding technologies to improve wayfinding and enhance mobility. It identifies the relative lack of---and need to build---an evidence base that includes public health outcomes. The RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework, widely employed in public health to foster effective translation of research to practice, is proposed as a means to assess personal wayfinding technologies. First, questions underlying RE-AIM components are explored for utility in assessing the current status of a given technology. Second, the framework is applied in a manner closer to its original intent to examine the translation and dissemination of a specific technology. Finally, the chapter explores some future directions in this rapidly expanding field.",

It takes a historical perspective to describe different types of smart home automation and their co-evolution with the performance of everyday practices.

Smart cares by type of elderly and situation were elderly-friendly smart home, smart care for management of chronic diseases in the elderly, and smart care for the elderly living alone. Smart care is needed to be implemented actively not only to reduce medical costs and improve the quality of medical services but also to ensure safety and quality of life for the elderly. However, multi-faceted efforts need to be made to help overcome the difficulties arising from degraded cognitive function of the elderly, considering the basic orientation of smart care such as mobile, smart, cloud computing, IoT, etc. For that, it would be necessary to develop elderly-friendly devices suited for characteristics of the elderly group and to actively deploy professional manpower, in parallel with active support from related organizations, who can provide instant support to the elderly encountering difficulty with the use, so as to stimulate the smart care service in the period ahead. Furthermore, as health information and privacy information generated in connection with individuals are sensitive data, it would be the most important to ensure that strict security is maintained for safe data transmission and that only necessary part of information is shared selectively.",

abstract="Research into assistive technologies for the elderly has been increasingly driven by the rapidly expanding population of older adults in many developed countries. One area of particular interest is technologies that enable aging-in-place, which allows older adults to remain in their own homes and live an independent life. Our work in this space is based on using a network of motion detectors in a smart home to extract patterns of behavior and classify them as either typical or atypical. Knowledge of these patterns can help caregivers and medical professionals in the study of any behavioral changes and enable better planning of care for their patients. Once we define and extract these patterns, we can construct behavioral feature vectors that will be the basis of our behavioral change detection system. These feature vectors can be further refined through traditional machine learning approaches such as K-means to extract any structure and reduce the dimensionality of the data. We can then use these behavioral features to identify significant variations across time, which could indicate atypical behavior. We validated our approach against features generated from human labeled activity annotations, and found that patterns derived from raw motion sensor data can be used as proxies for these higher level annotations. We observed that our machine learning-based feature vectors show a high correlation with the feature vectors derived from the higher level activity annotations and show a high classification accuracy in detecting potentially atypical behavior.",

By mid-century, Asia is projected to see its urban population increase by another 1.8 billion. This urban population explosion in Asia, mainly in developing countries, has posed severe challenges for town planners as well as researchers. Growing urban food requirements, increased city waste and effluent production, and environmental degradation are some of those challenges. The size of a city should at least closely match the supply of food it is able to procure.

abstract="Smart home is a home that has a set of electrical appliances connected to a network can be remotely controlled, accessed and monitored. Smart home normally is used to fine-tune human's daily life. However, the main problem is when different devices such as sensors and electrical appliances produced by different manufacturers being used in a smart home. Each device produced by different manufacturer might come with their own set of communication protocol. Therefore, it is important to have a standardized communication protocol for interconnecting and remotely controlling those devices to ensure data can be transmitted to each other. This project aims to present the Smart Home using MEMS Sensor and Ambient Intelligence (SAHOMASI) where in this paper, a standardized communication protocol is proposed to overcome the above problem. The features of the system includes monitoring elderly's activities, detect fall and sending email to caregiver upon abnormal activity or fall detected.",

abstract="As India becomes more and more urban, sustainability will become an issue of increasing importance. But what constitutes sustainability and how it should be pursued as a policy goal is contested and shows considerable variation both in theory and practice. In the first part of this paper, different conceptual perspectives on urban sustainability are examined, namely, sustainability as understood from the Brundtland Commission's Report, sustainable urban form as defined by planners, and the political economy approach of structuralist and post-structuralist scholars such as David Harvey. In the second part of the paper, urban sustainability is examined as policy in the Indian context, from the period before economic liberalization to the present and changes in policy are discussed. The current thrust on smart cities and gigantic urban-industrial corridors indicate that the scale of thinking about the urban has changed. The final section turns to the implications of the proposed policies in the context of land availability and sustainability.",

abstract="This paper proposes using a commodity-based smartwatch paired with a smartphone for developing a fall detection IoT application which is non-invasive and privacy preserving. The majority of current fall detection applications require specially designed hardware and software which make them expensive and inaccessible to the general public. We demonstrated that by collecting accelerometer data from a smartwatch and processing those data in a paired smartphone, it is possible to reliability detect (93.8{\%} accuracy) whether a person has encountered a fall in real-time. By wearing a smartwatch as a piece of jewelry, the well-being of a person can be monitored in real-time at anytime and anywhere as contrasted to being confined in a particular facility installed with special sensors and cameras. Using simulated fall data acquired from volunteers, we trained a fall detection model off-line that can be composed with a data collection accessor to continuously analyze accelerometer data gathered from a smartwatch to detect minor or serious fall at anytime and anywhere. The accessor-based architecture allows easy composition of the fall-detection IoT application tailored to heterogeneity of devices and variation of user's need.",

This observation gave the involved partners the chance to explore difference technological and design approaches in order to yield the optimum implementation. At the same time, it highlighted the need to follow a structured, multifaceted approach in order to tackle efficiently all requirements. Based on this process, the main objective of this chapter is to present the most important lessons learned as well as emphasize on the key aspects where enhancements and novel contributions were achieved in RADIO. Therefore, in the first section, after the conceptual communication architecture defined in RADIO is presented, critical communication requirements of the RADIO platform are identified focusing on local area ultra-low powerUltra-low power wireless networkscommunication technologies deployed in the home premises as well as efficient cloud infrastructure utilized. Then the second section highlights the actual state-of-the-art communication technologies explored, deployed, and integrated in the context of RADIO platform emphasizing on bridging and coexistence critical challenges encountered and addressed. Focusing on the integration problem the RADIO Gateway entity represented one of the most important cornerstones for the overall RADIO platform performance effectively comprising a highly complex compound entity, adequately analyzed in Sect. 5.3. Then in Sect. 5.4 important research activities based on BLEBluetooth Low Energy (BLE)communication technology are presented, enabling, on one hand, accurate indoor localizationLocalizationand, on the other hand, extended coverage area capabilities through multi-hop communicationMulti-hop communication. Finally, Sect. 5.5 presents all development and integration effort devoted by RADIO partners to the backend infrastructure.

abstract="Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a very active topic of research that is gaining more and more attention because of its characteristics, transparency and intelligence. Older people is one of the collectives that can take advantage of the use of AmI systems because, thanks to these characteristics, AmI systems can focus on older adults' real needs so that they satisfy one of their main motivations to adapt technological innovations: perceived benefits.And, perhaps, everything related to healthcare and home care is perceived by them as both valuable and beneficial. In this paper, it is presented the Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) of a healthcare AmI system to treat older people' motor impairment problems by using specific devices to control the patient's movements. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is being widely exploited. AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. One of the main differences of our system is that it provides therapist with support to design new therapies, to adapt them to each specific person and to control their execution instead of using a fixed set of exercises.",

abstract="Thread 5 addresses domestic design and technology, from the dwelling machines of modernist functionalism to the smart homes of the present, as exemplified by Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye (1931) and Apple's Home application (2016). In this technological and architectonic domain, the performative staples of efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness are traced in projects of functional transparency, from the Corbusian `machine for living in' to the `ubiquitous' but more invisible technologies of late. Conversely, the theatrical resides in the dramatic, the aesthetic, the sensuous: in synoptic networks that help control and understand the technological meshwork, but also enable a distinctly antitechnological variant of the good old antitheatrical prejudice---beginning from the modernist distrust of `ornament' in Le Corbusier's time. The chapter concludes on `ecological' notions of extended and enactive cognition that not only bear some affinity with theatricality and performativity, but also neatly define `textures of thought' in which dwellings and inhabitants are equally interwoven.",

abstract="In the course of demographic change, an increasing proportion of older people in need of care pose enormous burdens for the care sectors of today's society, which could dramatically aggravate in the next decades. Developing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies is one approach to support older people and people in need of care to live as long as possible independently at their own home. Besides technical opportunities and functions, future users' acceptance is decisive for the success and long-term usage of innovative technologies. Thus, for AAL technologies it has to be explored which factors are crucial for acceptance and to what extent those factors differ with regard to diverse user groups. Referring to existing technology acceptance models (in particular the UTAUT2-model), it is questionable whether such models can be adapted and are appropriately usable for the context of AAL technologies. In this paper, we therefore investigate potential users' attitudes towards AAL systems as well as the importance and relationships of technology-related and user-specific characteristics in a scenario-based online questionnaire study using an adapted and extended version of the UTAUT2-model. The undertaken adaption led to a better understanding of influencing factors for AAL acceptance: privacy concerns need to be addressed as an additional predictor.

abstract="Thermal Comfort Control for indoor environment is an important issue in smart city since it is benefit to people's health and helps to maximize their working productivity and provide a livable environment. In this paper, we present an IOT (Internet of Things) based personal thermal comfort model with automatic regulation. This model employs some environment sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, etc., to continuously obtain the general environmental measurements. Specially, video cameras are also integrated into the IOT network of sensors to capture the individual's activity and dressing condition, which are important factors affecting one's thermal sensation. The individual's condition image can be mapped into different metabolic rates and different clothing insulations by machine learning classification algorithm. Then, all the captured or converted data are fed into a PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model to learn the individual's thermal comfort level. In the prediction stage, we introduce the cuckoo search algorithm to solve the air temperature and air velocity with the learnt thermal comfort level, which is convergent rapidly. Our experiments demonstrate that the metabolic rates and clothing insulation have great effect on personal thermal comfort, and our model with video capture helps to obtain the variant values regularly, thus maintains the individual's thermal comfort balance in spite of the variation of activity or clothing.",

abstract="As people live longer, the increasing average age of the population places additional strains on our health and social services. There are widely recognised benefits to both the individual and society from supporting people to live independently for longer in their own homes. However, falls in particular have been found to be a leading cause of the elderly moving into care, and yet surprisingly preventative approaches are not in place; fall detection and rehabilitation are too late. In this paper we present FITsense, which is building a Smart Home environment to identify increased risk of falls for residents, and so allow timely interventions before falls occurs. An ambient sensor network, installed in the Smart Home, identifies low level events taking place which is analysed to generate a resident's profile of activities of daily living (ADLs). These ADL profiles are compared to both the resident's typical profile and to known ``risky'' profiles to allow evidence-driven intervention recommendations. Human activity recognition to identify ADLs from sensor data is a key challenge. Here we compare a windowing-based and a sequence-based event representation on four existing datasets. We find that windowing works well, giving consistent performance but may lack sufficient granularity for more complex multi-part activities.",

abstract="Healthcare informatics is undergoing a revolution because of the availability of safe, wearable sensors at low cost. Smart hospitals have exploited the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to create Remote Patients monitoring (RPM) models that observe patients at their homes. RPM is one of the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications. The long-term monitoring of patients using the AALs generates big data. Therefore, AALs must adopt cloud-based architectures to store, process and analyze big data. The usage of big data analytics for handling and analyzing the massive amount of big medical data will make a big shift in the healthcare field. Advanced software frameworks such as Hadoop will promote the success of medical assistive applications because it allows the storage of data in its native form not only in the form of electronic medical records that can be stored in data warehouses. Also, Spark and its machine learning libraries accelerate the analysis of big medical data ten times faster than MapReduce. The advanced cloud technologies that are capable of handling big data give great hope for developing smart healthcare systems that can provide innovative medical services. Building smart Remote patient monitoring models using cloud-based technologies will preserve the lives of patients, especially the elderly who live alone. A case study for monitoring patients suffering from chronic diseases (blood pressure disorders) for 24 h with a reading every 15 min using a cloud-based monitoring model shows its effectiveness in predicting the health status of the patients.",

abstract="An adaptive Electronic Patient Record (EPR) hiding system utilizing medical images as cover media has been presented in this chapter. The proposed system is based on embedding the EPR information in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Cover medical image is divided into 8{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}8 non-overlapping blocks and DCT is applied on each block. The two predefined coefficients of each 8{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}8 DCT block are used for embedding the EPR information. The proposed system uses an adaptive embedding factor based on mean of a selected block unlike the conventional way of predefining an embedding factor. In order to add an additional layer of security to the EPR, it has been encrypted before embedding it. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated using various image quality matrices like Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Normalized Cross Co-relation (NCC). The experimental investigations reveal that the proposed scheme is capable of providing better quality watermarked medical images compared to the conventional embedding scheme while maintaining good robustness thus it can be a better option for utilization in a typical e-health care communication system.",

Such systems and devices (here termed embedded systems) are aiming at improving human beings' quality of life. To do so, they typically acquire users' data to adjust themselves to different needs and environments in an adequate fashion. Consequently, they are connected to data networks to share this information and find elements that allow them to make the appropriate decisions. Then, for practical usage, their computational capabilities should be optimized to avoid issues such as: resources saturation (mainly memory and battery). In this line, machine learning offers a wide range of techniques and tools to incorporate ``intelligence'' into embedded systems, enabling them to make decisions by themselves. This paper reviews different data storage techniques along with machine learning algorithms for embedded systems. Its main focus is on techniques and applications (with special interest in Internet of Things) reported in literature about data analysis criteria to make decisions.",

The purpose of this study is to show that problems with smart home technology can be partially ascribed to differences in perception of the stakeholders involved. The perceptual worlds of caregivers, care receivers, and designers vary due to differences in background and experiences. To decrease the perceptual differences between the stakeholders, we propose an analysis of the expected and experienced effects of smart home technology for each group. For designers the effects will involve effective goals, caregivers are mainly interested in effects on workload and quality of care, while care receivers are influenced by usability effects. Making each stakeholder aware of the experienced and expected effects of the other stakeholders may broaden their perspectives and may lead to more successful implementations of smart home technology, and technology in general.",

Many Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods are data-driven, where the quality of collected data can significantly affect the accuracy of results. However, data collection for FDD of buildings is a challenging task as needed data is not typically readily available. In this paper we focus on the data collection for FDD of smart buildings.

abstract="As a new area of science and technology (S{\&}T), big data science and analytics embodies an unprecedentedly transformative power---manifested not only in the form of revolutionizing science and transforming knowledge, but also in advancing social practices, producing new discourses, catalyzing major shifts, and fostering societal transitions. Of particular relevance, it is instigating a massive change in the way both smart cities and sustainable cities are studied and understood, and in how they are planned, designed, operated, managed, and governed in the face of urbanization. This relates to what has been dubbed data-driven smart sustainable urbanism, an emerging approach which is based on a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logical and algorithmic rules and procedures and that employs new scientific methods and principles, while also harnessing urban big data to provide a more holistic and integrated view or synoptic intelligence of the city. This is underpinned by epistemological realism and instrumental rationality, which sustain and are shaped by urban science. However, all knowledge is socially constructed and historically situated, so too are research methods and applied research as related to S{\&}T and as historically produced social formations and practices that circumscribe and produce culturally specific forms of knowledge and reality. This chapter examines the unprecedented paradigmatic, scientific, scholarly, epistemic, and discursive shifts the field of smart sustainable urbanism is undergoing in light of big data science and analytics and the underlying advanced technologies, as well as discusses how these shifts intertwine with and affect one another, and their sociocultural specificity and historical situatedness. I argue that data-intensive science as a new paradigmatic shift is fundamentally changing the scientific and practical foundations of urban sustainability. In specific terms, the new urban science---as underpinned by sustainability science---is increasingly making cities more sustainable, resilient, efficient, livable, and equitable by rendering them more measurable, knowable, and tractable in terms of their operational functioning, management, planning, design, and development.",

abstract="Due to protocols such as 6LoWPAN and CoAP, wireless sensor nodes have become an integral part of the Internet. While this makes their data available on the Internet, it still remains a strictly devicecentric approach. However, one is usually interested in the phenomena observed by one or more devices and not in the sensors themselves. To bridge this gap, we introduce and evaluate the concept of Service-Level Semantic Entities (SLSE). They support the automatic semantic annotation of real-world objects based on networked sensor devices. SLSE continuously collect observations of sensors attached to some objects, and aggregates them to descriptions of the objects themselves. It then makes this augmented object data available as (semantic) linked data. This removes several layers of indirection in the semantic data, and allows to directly access properties of real-world objects.",

abstract="Transport is often neglected in ageing discourse, yet it is a vital component in the ecosystem of policy on ageing. This chapter looks at potential policy challenges and opportunities in designing and implementing transport and mobility solutions for future ageing populations. Potential challenges are first identified, including the heterogeneity of the ageing population and the diversity of their mobility and transport needs, the consideration of the wider social and environmental contexts, and the need for effective infrastructure systems. The chapter highlights existing policy programmes and initiatives in relation to their consideration of transport and mobility for an ageing population. Drawing on this evidence, the chapter concludes by outlining future policy changes and strategic directions which could improve transport and mobility solutions for an ageing population.",

abstract="The economist Fritz Schumacher observed in his 1970s' global bestseller Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered that we must look holistically at the world. Long before environmental and political awareness of issues such as global warming and protecting ecosystems had become mainstream, he pioneered the concept of natural capital in a world of finite resources. His ideas proved to be prescient, since the book was published in 1973, the year of the global oil crisis. Schumacher understood that our relationship with the planet was a challenge and believed that helping people to help themselves by making better choices should develop through our inner wisdom, not as a result of intervention from state, science or technology. In Schumacher's ideal vision of the world, the economy was underpinned by small, autonomous businesses, committed to ecology and peace or, as he termed it, ``Buddhist economics.''1",

Elderly people use the Internet the least from all age groups. The partial aim of this paper is to analyse whether, since 2009, there has been a constant increase in Internet users in the elderly age group in the Czech Republic and also the EU. The second scientific issue deals with the confirmation that the number of Internet users in the 65+ age group is similar to the EU-28 and V4. The analysis showed that the number of 65+ users has been steadily increasing since 2009. In the Czech Republic only 28.4{\%} elderly people used internet in 2015 and 26.7{\%} in 2014. According to Eurostat methodology the Internet is used in the 65--74 years age group by 33{\%} of users.

This chapter describes one such effort which distinguishes itself from the rest by considering and describing a system with true commercial potential and thus significant social impact. Promising efforts in investigating and identifying the requirements for a system of smart monitoring and adaptive lifestyle pattern detection and analysis are described. An initial proposal for a system relying on remote monitoring using persistent communications technology and a centralized data gathering, analysis and decision making is presented. During the initial development stage requirements for sensor placements, efficient sensor data formats and transmission protocols became apparent; unit testing and system validation demanded generation of large amounts of suitable sensor data. Here we also describe a simulator we developed in order to support these requirements; the rationale behind the simulator, its main functions and usage and the positive contribution it has made during the initial stages and the prototyping phases of the above system are explained. Finally a prototype developed in facilitating initial investigations is described and the vision for future developments is articulated.",

The pervasiveness of the so-called ``Smart Objects'', related to the Internet of Things technologies, is boosting this in many ways. The support for old people to take the daily tablets through an automatic device is an example. This work presents the prototype of a modular pill dispenser customized by end users according to their specific therapy needs. The prototype is a physical and modular set of pillboxes each containing the pills to be assumed in a therapy. The presented scenario at a specific time, set by the user, one or more pillboxes blink to alert the patient that is pill time. If for a given time interval the patient do not take the pill a sound notification is activated and plays for a given duration. If still nothing happens then a notification is sent to the caregiver's smartphone. The behavior of the pill dispenser is defined by the end user and can be modified any time. One peculiarity of the pill dispenser is that the number of physical boxes are decided by the user and can change any time to best fit the specific therapy. The final goal of this work is to push not professional users, in particular older people, to take advantages of new technologies to improve their life.",

abstract="This paper has two main objectives. The first objective is to present a set of design projects of interior design students focused on distributed, ambient and ubiquitous interactions. In this context, student works are analyzed under a theoretical framework. The second objective is to introduce the field of interior design as one of the forthcoming parties in smart technology implications. Interior design is a multi-faceted profession in which creative and technical solutions are applied to achieve a built interior environment. These solutions involve functionality, enhancement of the quality of life and the culture of the occupants and aesthetics. Interior design includes a scope of services to protect and enhance the health, life safety and welfare of the public. The paper analyzes and discusses nine design projects of the Topics Studio at the Interior Design Program, College of Architecture, University of Texas at San Antonio. In the 2012 Spring Semester, interior design students have applied an intense research pairing healthcare design strategies and smart technologies to two self-directed design thesis projects: A residence for Alzheimer's Disease patient, and a healthcare clinic for medical professionals who treat patients including Alzheimer's Disease. Projects are designed through the research and hypothetical application of remote control technologies, automation technologies, monitoring technologies, prompting / reminding technologies and prediction technologies. Physical and cognitive impairments, ADL limitations of older adults and patients, difficulties faced by family members and caregivers and clinical interventions in community health are considered not only from the interior design standpoint but also through technological advances. Results of this paper discuss how advanced technology is used as a design element by interior design students and merged with patient, caregiver and physician needs triad of healthcare projects. Perspectives on the studio experience are emphasized for future integrated design and practices of smart technology and interior design.",

Today, in fact, the silver economy comprises products and services in very diverse and by no means only ``social'' market segments.

These elements and structures influence the behavior of the organization and are part of the subconscious mind of the organization. The new technologies and tools like sensors, internet of things, augmented reality, social media, Big Data, etc. are attached and settled in this infrastructure---they are becoming part of it---and they change the perception of the organization. But they also change the possibilities for interaction both internally and externally. They change the ``cognitive processes'' of the organization and thus the subconscious mind of the organization. New concepts, such as social collaboration and realtime enterprise accelerate the interaction and business processes and open up new paradigms like the paradigm of sharing---the ``shareconomy''. Decisions are increasingly being supported by IT (Decision Support) or even automated. Systems and algorithms with learning abilities and Artificial Intelligence emerge or are moving in. How can the organizational and entrepreneurial governance be secured in such disruptive phase shifts? How can the foundations and frameworks of the organization be kept appropriate and stable? How can the subconscious mind of the organization---required as a basis for the fast and efficient action---be formed and shaped in a safe way. How to make it ``resilient''? This requires not only communication but also the right algorithms for the self-control of complex systems.

abstract="In today's world, to find a parking space for a vehicle is troublesome and tiring. Various methods can be opted to find an optimal solution for the parking problem. These methods incorporate the use of various types of sensors such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), image sensors, Infrared sensors (IR), ultrasonic sensors etc. A few of these systems also fuse the concept of Internet Of Things (IoT) and cloud database and collaborate with hardware to provide a better interface to the user. They also try to make their applications more user friendly by merging them with visual and vocal instructions and fusing them with an Android-based system. Some systems help the user by locating their parked vehicle and some help by finding the shortest route to their vehicle in a pool of cars. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief idea about the various techniques that have come up to sort these routine problems of parking and flaws which follow.",

abstract="In the context of twenty-first century, diabetes is one of the most lethal diseases from which millions of people of different age levels are suffering. It is imperative for a diabetes patient to maintain the blood glucose level all times as there is no stable solution for this disease. However, the infants and the elderly, suffering from diabetes might not have the notion of maintaining the level of sugar in their blood. So, constant monitoring of the patient has become the most feasible `solution'. But the traditional method for measuring blood glucose level is not a viable option for constant blood glucose monitoring. Even if this invasive method is more accurate, it is painful and also there is a risk of infection, although minimal. That is why the non-invasive method seems to be a reasonable option for the ongoing monitoring of blood glucose. For constant remote collection and monitoring of the data obtained from the diabetes patient, an IoT-based non-invasive monitoring system has been proposed in this research that can be a great aid, besides the invasive method for constant monitoring purposes.",

Losing their everyday independence is a major concern for the elderly, partly because they fear this could lead to an involuntary move to an assisted living facility instead of living independently. Since 2015, the Dutch government encourages their citizens to age-in-place, but at the same time struggles with how to implement new healthcare regulations. To support both government and citizens, we propose a digital platform to match supply and demand in the health and wellbeing domain. Such a platform should not only enable end-users to enhance self-management, but also support them to find solutions for everyday problems related to aging-in-place. To illustrate our Action Design Research we established a Living Lab in a metropolitan area in the Netherlands, and developed a prototype of the proposed platform in a real-life setting.",

For a deeper insight into this topic the second study was conducted in order to analyze gendered acceptance on specific health-related device. As results showed people's general attitude towards medical technology and their willingness to use such medical assisting devices is throughout positive.

The chapter starts with a definition and distinction of several synonymously used terms in the field of building automation and control systems (BACS) and a general architectural design. Section 2 introduces a classification of health related applications using BACS while Sect. 3 gives selected examples for each class to give an overview about possibilities, limits and efforts on the creation of building environments with positive health effects using building control systems. Those example applications will range from adaptive lighting control for health treatment (e.g. in dementia, or depression) to smart home automation networks for activity recognition. Each mentioned system is aiming to create an improved environment, support healthy living, or to detect emergencies and to react adequately. Finally, the achievements of recent scientific works are summarized and recommendations for the development of even more adaptive and healthier building environments through distributed building system technologies are discussed.",

abstract="The popular concept of SmartHome means that the appliances such as lighting, heating and door locks are controllable remotely through for example remote controls or mobile phones. The concept is becoming more and more realizable due to recent advancements in Internet-enabled technologies. SmartHomes can become even more intelligent and automated by exploiting such intelligent and affordable Internet-enabled technologies. However, this necessitates a context-aware system that provides services to respond to the context changes to enable such SmartHome automation at the edge of today's context-centric networks. To this end, this paper designs and develops a context-aware reasoning service for home automation which provides a novel way to connect SmartHomes through the use of a distributed context exchange network overlay. It enables mobility service application to communicate with and control SmartHomes remotely.",

abstract="This book chapter presents the importance of mobile solutions based on body sensor network (BSN) architecture for health monitoring in case of motor-impaired people. In this work, we present a noninvasive system based on mobile technology that allows biomedical signal monitoring by wearable electrodes. The concept of brain--computer interfaces (BCIs) is the ultimate trend for the entertainment industry (gaming), but this technology has potential by providing signal alerts to motor-impaired people (epilepsy or to enable communication). The mobile technologies allow developing the private cloud for tracking data from biomedical sensors and temporary data storage. Motor impairment is total or partial loss of function of a body part that can be translated to muscle weakness, lack of muscle control, or total paralysis. In case of people with motor impairments, monitoring at home involves a monitoring system based on body sensor network (BSN), Internet of Things (IoT), and feedback from doctors. Such a system may lead to reduced costs of hospitalization.",

abstract="Smart Cities with their mobility system are assumed to be based on smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration, assigning citizens significant roles. While some argue that ICT will enhance democratic debate and empower citizens, others concern about the development of Smart Cities ``without critical discussions and politics''. Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched its Smart City project in 2010, setting specific criteria to ensure the ``participation of all the stakeholders''; however, drawing on analysis of official documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart Communities' stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of these experiments would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services.",

abstract="Sustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism. Undoubtedly, sustainable development has significantly positively influenced city planning and development since the early 1990s. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and, thus, the enormous benefits that have been realized from the planning and development of sustainable urban forms as an instance of sustainable cities. However, the existing models of such forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities, are associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how such forms should be monitored, understood, and analyzed to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and hence to overcome the kind of wicked problems, intractable issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the great potential of advanced ICT for, and also its proven role in, supporting sustainable cities in improving their performance under what is labeled `smart sustainable cities.' This integrated approach to urbanism takes multiple forms of combining the strengths of sustainable cities and smart cities based on how the concept of smart sustainable cities can be conceptualized and operationalized. In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for cities across the globe to be smarter and thus more sustainable by particularly utilizing big data technology and its applications in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. Having a twofold aim, this chapter firstly provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the domain of sustainable urbanism, with a focus on compact cities and eco-cities as models of sustainable urban forms and thus instances of sustainable cities, in terms of research issues and debates, knowledge gaps, challenges, opportunities, benefits, and emerging practices. It secondly highlights and substantiates the real, yet untapped, potential of big data technology and its novel applications for advancing sustainable cities. In so doing, it identifies, synthesizes, distills, and enumerates the key practical and analytical applications of big data technology for multiple urban domains. This study shows that sustainable urban forms involve limitations, inadequacies, difficulties, fallacies, and uncertainties in the context of sustainability, in spite of what has been realized over the past three decades or so within sustainable urbanism. Nevertheless, as also revealed by this study, tremendous opportunities are available for exploiting big data technology and its novel applications to smarten up sustainable urban forms in ways that can improve, advance, and sustain their contribution to the goals of sustainable development by optimizing and enhancing their operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies across multiple urban domains, as well as by finding answers to challenging analytical questions and transforming the way knowledge can be developed and applied.",

To better understand older adult perceptions and attitudes to adoption of such systems, we describe a 3 week field trial of an application and view the results through the lens of protection motivation theory. Our participants identified a number of threats including not being able to live independently, fear of getting lost, being stigmatised and lack of privacy. Usability, accessibility, reliability, costs and usefulness all negatively impacted coping appraisal that would result in non-adoption, despite their stated intention to adopt the technology in the future.",

At present, there are a number of smart home applications being developed with a raft of technologies that provide fragments of the necessary functionality. Nevertheless, there is currently a major gap between these endeavours and the vision of smart homes in which there are adaptive, personalised and context-aware assistance capabilities. To bridge this divide between practice and aspiration, this Chapter introduces semantic smart homes -- a novel concept whose aim is to move from the current state-of-the-art of smart home technologies to the future infrastructure that is needed to support the full richness of the smart home vision. We present a conceptual system architecture for semantic smart homes and elaborate functions and explore the interplay of constituent components. The Chapter focuses predominantly on the methodology of semantic modelling, content generation and management. We illustrate the potential of the semantic smart homes metaphor through a number of use scenarios.",

pages="69--93",
abstract="The concept of resilience is central to understanding how technology might have a role to play in reducing the disproportionate vulnerability of older adults in natural and human-made disasters. Resilience has been defined in various ways by different theorists and researchers, but the common thread is the idea of adaptive capacity and the ability to recover from adversity (Norris, Stevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche, {\&} Pfefferbaum, 2008). Resilience is not simply a personality style or a characteristic of individuals but a product of the interplay among various determinants of population health: income and social status, social support, education, employment, social and physical environments, health practices and coping skills, developmental factors, biological and genetic endowment, health services, gender, and culture (Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC], 2003). Disasters are large-scale disturbances or sources of adversity that tax the resilience not only of individuals but of whole communities and broader societies. All members of a population can be at risk depending on the nature of the crisis (InterInter-Agency Standing Committee [IASC], 2006). As would be expected given the multiple interacting determinants that come into play, the pathways from risk vulnerability to disaster resilience are complex (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [IFRC], 2004). Similar to other population health challenges, the availability of appropriate resources, effectively implemented, is likely to contribute to more desirable outcomes for individuals and groups who are responding to and attempting to recover from disasters (Lindsay, 2003). Disaster resilience is increasingly in the public eye as the number of catastrophic natural and human-made events continues to rise. This chapter examines the potential for technology to promote disaster resilience among older adults. They are a population subgroup with increased vulnerability in emergencies not because of age per se, but because they are more likely to live with a constellation of risk factors for increased vulnerability, including health problems, dependence on healthcare and social services, lower socioeconomic status, and restricted social networks. In addition, with increasing age, higher proportions of older adults are women, a population subgroup with heightened vulnerability across the life course (Powell, 2009).",

abstract="This chapter outlines the concept of `big data driven business modelBusiness model' and utilizes it to describe a set of businesses that rely on big data to achieve their key value proposition and to substantially augment their value proposition to differentiate themselves in order to gain competitive advantage. It describes the impact of big data on each of the elements as identified in the Business model canvas. Also the chapter discusses the potential of big data for mass customization and personalization of product and services, as a value proposition in its own right, on B2B and B2C logistics as well as for customer relationship management and customer service. It also touches upon how big data has facilitated a shift in our conceptions of utility as opposed to resources as the basis for socio-economic value creation. Also, the chapter explores this issue a bit further by understanding the implications of big data on partnerships, monetization, and the opportunities and challenges it raises for accounting, budgeting and performance metrics. In conclusion, the chapter acknowledges the synergistic potential with other emerging technologies such as 3D printing, Robots, Drones, self-driving cars, and the like.",

abstract="A smart home specifically for the elder people has been plannedto be developed using wireless sensors. The design intricacies andimplementation details of a novel Wireless Sensors systems has been targetedto achieve that. The system is designed to support people who wish to livealone but, because of old age, ill health or disability, there is some riskin this, which worries their family or friends. The system works on theprinciple of using sensor units (SU) to monitor the appliance throughout ahouse and detect when certain desired electrical equipments are turned on.Rules are defined for appliances to turn on in certain time intervals. Therules are flexible and can be user-defined based on the daily activities ofa person. Several levels of alarm conditions have been created based oncombination of rules that are violated. Any number of sensor units may beinstalled in a house, one each to monitor an electrical appliance. A centralcontroller unit (CCU) queries the sensor units and logs the data into a PCat a pre-defined rate. Communication between the SUs and the controller isusing radio-frequency wireless media. The rules inference engine runs on thePC and whenever the situation requires, sends a text message to thecare-givers or relatives. Since no vision sensors (camera or infra-red) areused, the system is non-invasive, respects privacy and has found wideacceptance. The system is completely customizable, allowing the user toselect which appliances to monitor and define exactly what is classified asunusual behavior. Some other sensors such as bed sensors, gas sensor etc.,are considered to make the system a complete system suitable to define adigital home.",

abstract="Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems rely on the use of environmental information to seamlessly assist users in their daily lives. As the development of AmI architectures is involving a larger amount of users and devices information, the potential occurrence of conflicts derived from the use of this information becomes higher. These conflicts are usually represented as inconsistencies between different pieces of information. As a result, the AmI systems need a mechanism to decide upon these conflicting situations in order to still give an appropriate response. In this chapter we propose the use of Argumentation as a methodology for automatically detecting and solving these conflicting situations. More specifically, we describe a smart TV service which combines different information about viewers' presence and preferences and TV programs data to elaborate a list of recommending programs. Several arguments for and against recommending a same program are presented to the AmI system. Then, by means of argumentative techniques and several meta-decision criteria, the system is able to assist through mediation in the context of conflicting preferences or needs.",

We examine three broad challenges. First, we argue there is a gap between the new expectations imposed on libraries and the way they are measured and evaluated by government organisations, with measurement frameworks that fail to account for their newly expanded role. Second, we argue for a renewed approach to the governance of libraries, calling for planners and policymakers to recognise their more complex, multifarious, and dispersed contribution to the life of the communities they serve. Lastly, we argue that reinvigorated investment in libraries has been highly uneven, with libraries in urban locations attracting considerable high-profile investment at the expense of regional and outer-urban libraries.",

abstract="Activity recognition is an important step towards automatically measuring the functional health of individuals in smart home settings. Since the inherent nature of human activities is characterized by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty, it poses a great challenge to build a robust activity recognition model. This study aims to exploit deep learning techniques to learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminant latent patterns inherent in the low-level features. Specifically, we first adopt a stacked autoencoder to extract high-level features, and then integrate feature extraction and classifier training into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. We use three benchmark datasets to evaluate our method, and investigate two different original sensor data representations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition rate and generalizes better across different original feature representations compared with other four competing methods.",

This is a major health risk, especially among the elderly; thus, the early detection of fall motion is of great significance. A smart home care system is needed to monitor abnormal events. This paper first conducts a survey of existing smart systems and techniques in detecting fall motion in human movement, including the emergence of new natural user interface (NUI) devices and systems in the consumer market. Secondly, the paper categorizes smart technologies for fall motion detection into three main technological groups: acoustic and ambient sensor-based, kinematic sensor-based, and lastly the computer vision and NUI. An insightful discussion of each category's advantages and disadvantages is provided. The findings show a promising research direction of integrating the computer vision with the novel consumer-grade NUI device, such as Kinect, in achieving of an affordable and practical smart home fall motion detection system.",

Childhood obesity and malnutrition are one of the major healthcare problems regarding children. Such a crisis can cause several diseases and death in the long run. We have strongly felt the need for an infallible system to safeguard our children users. To establish our idea, we proposed a framework by implementing the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT), where a child's mental and physical health state can be tracked and necessary steps can be taken with the help of parents and health tutors. In our system, we set up a communication medium among children, health tutors, and parents. Various features like activity tracking, geolocation, and fitness programs are installed within the system.

Most older adults prefer to age in place in their home environment. Assistive ICT can support older adults in staying independent, connected, and healthy and provide help in emergency situations. However, older adults represent a special group regarding the use of ICT: they are still often less experienced and cautious in adapting new technologies. Correspondingly, acceptance poses the greatest barrier for the success of assistive ICT. Older adults are not a homogeneous group, they differ in their experience with technologies, attitudes towards aging, and ideas for quality of life. In a questionnaire approach, N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}166 participants' attitudes towards aging and evaluation of two examples of ICT are assessed. The analysis shows, that technology generations differ in their opinions about aging as well as their assessment of assistive ICT.

abstract="Water management has become a key issue in the 21st century, with increasing population, economic growth and climatic variability. Water is a stressed resource in India. Annual per capita water availability is expected to decline to 1140 m3 by 2050, from 1545 m3 in 2011 (Government of India in Water management, [1]). With 45{\%} of population living in urban areas by 2050 (Shukla in How India earns, spends and saves: unmasking the real India. Sage Publications, India, [2]), the availability of water will become a paramount issue. The availability of water is fundamental element to human life, economy and political stability and hence, sustainable water management is critical for existence. Government of India has launched a Smart City Mission for building 100 Smart Cities, in which 24 {\texttimes} 7 availability of water is one of the major emphasis. Traditionally water allocation decisions have been the exclusive domain of technical experts, public officials or political interests, but now there is a shift towards participative involvement of other stakeholders, namely citizens. Adequate water being the essential input in Smart City, calls for an inclusive and participatory management of this resource which extends beyond the city limits. Smart Water management in cities seeks to address challenges in the urban water management through integration of ICT and eDemocracy. Hydro-Informatic approache that is data driven and is technology  based can form the basis of analyzing the complexities in water management, particularly in water scarce areas. This chapter looks into inclusive and eDemocratic measures for planning of water smart cities. The need is to develop eDemocracy based collaborative planning efforts to tackle pervading water issues.",

Such systems must collect and analyze data in the home to recognize unusual activities and alert care givers and/or family members in emergency situations. To address this challenge we developed a flexible and scalable multi-agent system for sensor data collection, integration, processing, and alert management.

The DBGroup designed and developed the MOMIS data integration system, giving raise to a successful innovative enterprise DataRiver (www.datariver.it), distributing MOMIS as open source. MOMIS provides an integrated access to structured and semistructured data sources and allows a user to pose a single query and to receive a single unified answer. Description Logics, Automatic Annotation of schemata plus clustering techniques constitute the theoretical framework. In the context of data integration, the ISGroup addressed problems related to the management and querying of heterogeneous data sources in large-scale and dynamic scenarios. The reference architectures are the Peer Data Management Systems and its evolutions toward dataspaces. In these contexts, the ISGroup proposed and evaluated effective and efficient mechanisms for network creation with limited information loss and solutions for mapping management query reformulation and processing and query routing. The main issues of data integration have been faced: automatic annotation, mapping discovery, global query processing, provenance, multidimensional Information integration, keyword search, within European and national projects. With the incoming new requirements of integrating open linked data, textual and multimedia data in a big data scenario, the research has been devoted to the Big Data Integration Research Area. In particular, the most relevant achieved research results are: a scalable entity resolution method, a scalable join operator and a tool, LODEX, for automatically extracting metadata from Linked Open Data (LOD) resources and for visual querying formulation on LOD resources. Moreover, in collaboration with DATARIVER, Data Integration was successfully applied to smart e-health.",

With this increasing proportion of elderly people, we will encounter many problems like a degenerative disease, the depletion of welfare money like public medical insurance and the lowering growth rate of nation, and so on. In this research, at first every possible expected issue related to aging population was drawn through literature review and expert interview. Then products and service need to tackle aging population issues was drawn. The last step is to draw key technologies to realize these products and services. Among such technologies, we studied which technology belongs to the HCI technology, and carried out survey of the impact of each technology economically or socially. Based on these results, we presented a R{\&}D strategy of the Korean government for the HCI technology development in response to the future aging society.",

Eco-responsible cities care much about the distribution of sustainable wealth across urban actors, space, and time. Interactions among diverse people and activities are invaluable assets for cities, schools for respecting difference and living harmoniously together. This chapter focusses on the social capital of sustainable cities and their capacity for intergenerational and intercultural equity, public health, safety, and solidarity, including in relationship to surrounding seas. Cities are themselves important direct and indirect sources of investment, education, and employment, the first factor of social integration, followed by housing. They can give the impulse for local to global initiatives on land and in the sea. As migration rises on the global horizon, reinforcing inclusiveness is of increasing importance in cities that feel part of a universal community. Nobody should be left outside or behind; all citizens should have access to the conditions to enjoy a healthy, meaningful, and rewarding life, in balance with the blue planet.",

A problem often encountered in assisted living settings is activity recognition. Although activity recognition has been vastly studied by many researchers, the temporal features that constitute an activity usually have been ignored by researchers. Temporal features can provide useful insights for building predictive activity models and for recognizing activities. In this paper, we explore the use of temporal features for activity recognition in assisted living settings. We discover temporal relations such as order of activities, as well as their corresponding start time and duration features. To validate our method, we used four months of real data collected from a smart home.",

Our solution is standalone and user centric as it is portable, cost efficient, user friendly, privacy preserving, and requires only technologies which exists in cellphones. In addition, Gradient is light weight which makes it device friendly since cellphones are constrained by energy and memory limitations. Our work is based on accelerometer sensor data and the data derived from gravity sensors, a recently available inbuilt sensor in smartphones. Through experimentation, we demonstrate that Gradient exhibits superior accuracy among other fall detection solutions.",

To address the communication needs of the IoT, research is being done to develop new networking architectures and to extend existing architectures. An area that lacks attention in these efforts is the emphasis on utilisation of omnipresent local data. There are a number of issues (e.g., underutilisation of local resources and dependence on cloud based data) that need to be addressed to exploit the benefits of utilising local data. We present a novel data dissemination model, called the Organic Data Dissemination (ODD) model to utilise the omni-present data around us, where devices deployed with the ODD model are able to operate even without the existence of networking infrastructure. The realisation of the ODD model requires innovations in many different area including the areas of opportunistic communications, naming of information, direct peer-to-peer communications and reinforcement learning. This paper focuses on highlighting the usage of the ODD model in real application scenarios and the details of the architectural components.",

However, human knowledge about the world has not been fully used on the current Web which focuses on social communication; the prospect of interacting with things other than people on the future Web is very exciting. The purpose of Web services for ``things'' is to provide a tunnel for people to interact with things in the physical world from anywhere through the Internet. Extending the service targets from people to anything challenges the existing techniques of Web services from three aspects: first, an unified interface should be provided for people to describe the needs of things; then basic components should be designed in a Web service for things; finally, implementation of a Web service for things should be optimized when mashing up multiple sub Web services.",

In the pursuit of independence and sustainable care for the elderly, emerging technological solutions based on ICT and robotics are expected to be essential. However, the integration of advanced assistive technologies into care services or the daily lives of elderly people is not straightforward. Moreover, the aging issue is a global one, and the solutions could be global as well. This raises the question how can we apply technological care solutions under different lifestyles, work cultures, and welfare policies in various countries and regions? In this chapter, we present the findings and remarks from a comparative study of Japanese and Finnish elderly care service systems, which was conducted as part of an international collaborative project called METESE (Meaningful Technologies for Seniors: Safety, Comfort and Joy). This study aimed to clarify the requirements and integration process of technologies in elderly care in these countries. We applied a mixed method approach, focusing on three types of stakeholders: the elderly, care personnel, and managers of care services. By combining and analyzing this data, we illustrate characteristics of elderly care and expectations for technologies in Japan and Finland from multiple perspectives. This analysis provides insights on how to integrate and harmonize technologies in different types of elderly care service systems.",

abstract="Nutrition plays a key role in both the prevention of several critical diseases and lead an healthier life in the modern society. In order to analyse household's eating habits in the Italian scenario, authors propose the design of an innovative system called ``Smart Shelve''. This system consists in a robotic structure integrable with various appliances, such as refrigerators, which allows to receive and deliver several types of foods in order to control their daily consumption. Smart Shelve is equipped with external optical sensors for food recognition, while inside it is composed of several food compartments in which load cells measure the weight of each type of food. The system is capable to warn the users who have recently conducted an incorrect style. The system is also able to send the acquired food consumption information to the cloud in order to provide statistical services regarding the nutrition style of clusters of users localized in a specific geographical area (e.g. district or region).",

abstract="This paper describes the findings arising from ongoing qualitative usability evaluation studies on mobile companion robotics in smart home environments from two research projects focused on socio-technical innovation to support independent living (CompanionAble and Mobiserv). Key findings are described, and it is stated that the robotic companion, the smart home environment, and external services need to be seamlessly integrated to create a truly supportive and trusted system. The idea of robot personas is introduced, and based on our empirical observations, it is argued that the robot persona, rather than the physical embodiment, is the most important determinant of the degree of users' acceptance in terms of users' perceived trustability and responsiveness of the robot and therefore their sense of enhanced usability and satisfaction with such personal assistive systems.",

Lisbon Strategy [1] and ``Leipzig Charter [2] on Sustainable European Cities'' both recognize that cities are ``centers of knowledge and sources of growth and innovation''. Developing intelligent and innovative solutions, using responsible and sustainable resources, many cities are implementing strategies for transforming themselves into a ``knowledge city'', but the results still have little significance, particularly because it is necessary to identify and manage the intangible assets, recognized as intellectual capital. This paper proposes an approach to audit this knowledge using the same concept of intellectual capital that is applied to companies.

abstract="San Francisco, in 2016, is currently enjoying what AOL founder Steven Case calls the `third Internet wave', a phenomenon that is dramatically reinventing `the City', as local residents affectionately call it. This latest boom is attracting tens of thousands of `digital gold miners' from around the world --- entrepreneurs, start-ups, investors, corporate ventures and regional development agencies --- who are tapping this lucrative mother lode to `strike it rich'. However, this instant wealth has not come without serious problems. The influx of tens of thousands of entrepreneurs and billions of dollars of venture funding from around the world has led to skyrocketing rents, urban gentrification, evictions, overloaded transit systems, an exodus of teachers, police and other public service workers, local grassroots opposition to development and growing income disparities. Fundamental issues are being raised by San Francisco's current `Gold Rush': whether economic growth can continue without adequate housing, schools and public services; how cities will be affected by global warming; whether these trends be reversed or if they are inevitable; what policies would be required to address poverty and climate change. How these issues could be addressed is considered here.",

Given the much increased buying power of the elderly, the increased heterogeneity of consumption wishes and needs corresponding to the differentiation of old age, as well as the empirical evidence for an age-specific change in consumption requirements, it stands to reason to look for inherent impulses for economic growth and employment by dint of new ``age-sensitive'' product ranges and services and to promote their development and expansion. Today, in fact, the silver economy comprises products and services in very diverse and by no means only ``social'' market segments. In addition to the health economy, the silver economy affects such diverse sectors as mobility and IT. The following contribution provides an insight into the development of the silver economy in Germany and its future prospects.",

Our hypothesis is that the addition of a structural representation and transitional features will improve performance for the corresponding prediction tasks of different networks. We apply our graphical feature-based approach on smart phone GPS sensor data to predict activities performed by phone users. We represent the location category corresponding to each GPS value as a node and movement of users from one GPS location to another as an edge in graph. Then we extract graphical features such as existence of nodes and edges from the graph representation and add them to basic sensor data features coming from the smart phone. We find that using this augmented feature set improves activity recognition accuracy by 7.27{\%} compared to using only basic non-graphical features with feature set augmented with existence of nodes performing the best.",

abstract="Coping with contemporary urban challenges and smart city developments actually implies a conscious effort to engage a range of actors of local ecosystems and transform ways of implementing things in a significant, fundamental and structural rather than incremental manner, which results in more qualitative outcomes and cooperative, highly inclusive, decision-making processes that affect current and future quality of local communities' living perspectives. Citizens and stakeholders' participation in such an effort is growing in importance, in alignment with the currently prevailing shift from a top-down to a bottom-up planning paradigm. Along these lines, the focus of this paper is on smartening up local communities, considered as the heart of smart cities' development. More specifically, the paper targets citizens and stakeholders' empowerment and engagement in a specific cultural planning exercise in a less privileged suburb of Athens metropolitan area, the Municipality of Korydallos. This is accomplished by the development of an innovative stepwise participatory planning framework, effectively combining classical and Web-based participatory tools for establishing face-to-face and online interaction at the different steps of the participatory process; and broadening substantial participation of various citizens and stakeholders' groups in this exercise.",

abstract="The chapter contributes to the development of service science by offering an integrated view of human systems and technical systems in a practice-based approach. Existing ways of doing, knowing, and connecting are changing, and new practices are emerging due to the IoE. Social and material reality fundamentally consists of practices which are produced and reproduced through everyday actions. Moving innovation into the practice realm means going from the outcome or objects to the very process---that is, innovating as a verb, in reference to the emergent process. The Healthcare ecosystem provides evidence on how humans and machines together compose complex adaptive service systems that affect and are affected by new sociomaterial practices. In such context innovating is framed as a texture of practices such that the set of practices rests on other practices performed by actors who integrate material and social resources (e.g., knowledge, tools, languages, artefacts) to improve service provision and actors' well-being. Multiple sociomaterial connections across actions arise at the cross-points of actors' interactions and resource integration, revealing a broader picture that can depict service innovation complexity more accurately.",

abstract="Strengthening capacity of urban systems and their constituents in order to effectively tackle contemporary challenges and risks in a rapidly evolving, complex and uncertain global environment; and produce value for local communities in a sustainable and inclusive way, brings to the forefront the concept of smart governance. Tracking paths to smart governance, being the focus of this work, implies the need to conceptualize smartness and governance; and shed light on key organizational attributes that can pave the way for the transition from government to smart governance. Having identified these attributes by literature review, the paper highlights institutional, organizational, societal etc. developments in a Greek city, Korydallos Municipality, in order barriers and gaps in its trajectory to smart governance to be illuminated, both before and during the economic recession and austerity stress, faced by the Greek economy. Experiences gained by this pilot example, representing a rather typical small and medium-sized city in the Mediterranean context, provide useful inferences and evidence-based results for similar cities that strive to ride the smart governance wave.",

abstract="The collaboration between wireless sensor networks and the distributed robotics has prompted the making of mobile sensor networks. However, there has been a growing enthusiasm in developing mobile sensor networks, which are the favoured family of wireless sensor networks in which autonomous movement assumes a key part in implementing its application. By introducing mobility to nodes in wireless sensor networks, the capability and flexibility of mobile sensor networks can be enhanced to support multiple mansions, and to address the previously stated issues. The reduction in costs of mobile sensor networks and their expanding capacities makes mobile sensor networks conceivable and useful. Today, many types of research are focused on the making of mobile wireless sensor networks due to their favourable advantage and applications. Allowing the sensors to be mobile will boost the utilization of mobile wireless sensor networks beyond that of static wireless sensor networks. Sensors can be mounted on, or implanted in animals to monitor their movements for examinations, but they can also be deployed in unmanned airborne vehicles for surveillance or environmental mapping. Mobile wireless sensor networks and robotics play a crucial role if it integrated with static nodes to become a Mobile Robot, which can enhance the capabilities, and enables their new applications. Mobile robots provide a means of exploring and interacting with the environment in more dynamic and decentralised ways. In addition, this new system of networked sensors and robots allowed the development of fresh solutions to classical problems such as localization and navigation beyond that. This article presents an overview of mobile sensor network issues, sensor networks in robotics and the application of robotic sensor networks.",

abstract="Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are very useful for fully automatic extraction of discriminative features from raw sensor data. This is an important problem in activity recognition, which is of enormous interest in ambient sensor environments due to its universality on various applications. Activity recognition in smart homes uses large amounts of time-series sensor data to infer daily living activities and to extract effective features from those activities, which is a challenging task. In this paper we demonstrate the use of the CNN and a comparison of results, which has been performed with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), recurrent neural networks and other machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models, Hidden Semi-Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields. The experimental results on publicly available smart home datasets demonstrate that the performance of 1D-CNN is similar to LSTM and better than the other probabilistic models.",

We proposed a system for automatic control of appliances as well as power reduction module. When the user enters into the room, the light and fan will turn ON automatically, and while the user exits, it will turn OFF automatically using PIR sensor. Based on the presence of the user, the power reduction module switches the appliances in the span. It also controls the speed of fan based on room temperature with LM-35 sensor. By using ACS712 Current Sense Module, we control the current flow. And also we can control the appliances through mobile when the user is not at home.

In an effort to alleviate these challenges, the current study proposes a goal oriented top-down approach to assistive living which offers a paradigm shift from a sensor centric view to a goal oriented view. The basic concept of the approach is that if a user's goal can be identified, then assistance can be provided proactively through pre-defined or dynamically constructed activity related instructions. The paper first introduces the system architecture for the proposed approach. It then describes an ontological goal model to serve as the basis for such an approach. The utility of the approach is illustrated in a use scenario focused on assisting a user with their activities of daily living.",

Technological navigation aids for blind must provide accurate information about the environment and select the best path to reach a chosen destination. Urban barriers represent dangers for the blind users. The dynamism of smart cities promotes a constant change of these dangers and therefore a potentially ``dangerous territory'' for these users. Previous work demonstrated that redundant solutions in smart environments complemented by human computation could provide a reliable and trustful data source for a new generation of blind navigation systems. We propose and discuss a modular architecture, which interacts with environmental sensors to gather information and process the acquired data with advanced algorithms empowered by human computation. The gathered metadata should enable the creation of ``happy maps'' that are delivered to blind users through a previously developed navigation system.",

abstract="Against the background of demographic change, today's society is getting increasingly older. In order to handle growing care needs and shortages of skilled workers, ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies provide prevention and rehabilitation measures which facilitate aging in place and relieve caregivers. In this context, ultrasonic whistles could represent an innovative assistance system for home automation, safety prevention, positioning, and motion analysis. However, the acceptance of AAL-technologies is challenging due to perceived restrictions, e.g., on privacy and autonomy, and depends on individual attitudes, demands, and concerns. As health impairments and care dependency increase with age, research focus is set on age-related user factors. We examined user-specific concepts of aging in relation to the assessment of ultrasonic whistles in home care. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews and a scenario-based ground plan interaction were conducted. Results indicate that particularly positive or negative associations with aging affect AAL-acceptance, strongly related to issues of quality of life, active aging, social integration, dealing with change, health, and care dependency. Regarding trade-offs between perceived benefits and barriers, users with positive concepts of aging consider AAL as relief to maintain autonomy, ensure safety prevention, and facilitate everyday life whereas users with negative concepts of aging express concerns about dependency on technology, loss of control, restrictions on privacy, and data security. The findings contribute to an understanding of -aging concepts and their relation to care assistance that can be used for age-specific communication concepts.",

abstract="Ageing-in-place, the ability to age holistically in the community, is increasingly gaining recognition as a solution to address resource limitations in the elderly care sector. Effective elderly care models require a personalised and all-encompassing approach to caregiving. In this regard, sensor technologies have gained attention as an effective means to monitor the wellbeing of elderly living alone. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of non-intrusive sensor systems to detect socially isolated community dwelling elderly. Using a mixed method approach, our results showed that sensor-derived features such as going-out behavior, daytime napping and time spent in the living room are associated with different social isolation dimensions. The average time spent outside home is associated with the social loneliness level, social network score and the overall social isolation level of the elderly and the time spent in the living room is positively associated with the emotional loneliness level. Further, elderly who perceived themselves as socially lonely tend to take more naps during the day time. The findings of this study provide implications on how a non-intrusive sensor-based monitoring system comprising of motion-sensors and a door contact sensor can be utilized to detect elderly who are at risk of social isolation.",

Finally, the analysis focuses on the strategies deployed in the construction and dissemination of expert discourse about big data by observing the processes of reconceptualisation and recontextualisation of knowledge that are activated in its argumentation.",

abstract="One of the main issues regarding the monitoring of persons in a smart home environment is the accuracy of the daily control of the person, the health prevention and the timely prediction of abnormal situations. To tackle this problem, this work proposes the use of an improved version of the Elman Neural Network (Elman-NN). In order to minimize the error between inputs and desired outputs, we optimize some criteria of the network to gain good results. We propose to use the Differential Evolution algorithm in the learning step of the Elman-NN to evolve the error performance. Our proposed model is responsible to predict the activities of the monitored elderly and to detect any state changes. This hybridization will help to optimize the weight and the bias of the network to achieve our objective function and to obtain a good network. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model is satisfactory for elderly person's movement prediction.",

abstract="Nowadays, we live in environments where smart products enable new processes of human and non-human interaction. Smart concepts push functions beyond traditional levels of expectation. It is widely appraised that smart concepts enhance products to make them respond to human needs and expectations. However, regardless of the level of complexity and intelligence of those products (regardless of scale, from home environment to an object), if the environment is non-user-friendly, users will reject them and eventually abandon them. Conceptualizing intelligent solutions is more often centered on the requirements of functions and overlooks the profile of users, a critical aspect to outline the experience. Present-day interaction between users and smart products should be enabled by their physical model, finishing, interface features and functional capabilities. The quality of experience is not only grounded on the type and efficiency of the task performed. The quality of the experience depends on: the physical experience (dimension, height, shape, finishing); the sensorial experience (how does the artifact stimulate the sensorial human system); the cognitive experience (how easy it is to interact with technology) and the emotional experience (is this a pleasant experience? Would we repeat it?) Moreover, outlining the users' demands and expectations from environments, products and technology is also critical to reach qualified and appealing solutions. The aim of this paper is to establish the need of taking a different approach when conceptualizing smart environments and products, arguing that users can only understand inherent intelligence if the parameters that sponsor an emotional appealing experience are considered throughout the design process.",

When a city reaches one million or more of population size, it becomes more complex for its planning, design and management compared to a small city. For instance, when a city reaches one million inhabitants, its accessibility will be largely determined by elements of its urban form and structure as well as elements of transport infrastructures and, recently, elements of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This accessibility determines in large the interaction between economic and spatial design strategies. After the introduction, this study is divided in five sections. The first section presents the ``Conceptual framework of the Smart Metropolitan Regional Development'' of the study; The second section presents ``Urbanization of the Conakry Peninsula in Time and Space''; The third section focuses on the ``Urban Accessibility and Mobility''; The fourth section presents ``Urbanization, Economic Growth and Metropolitan Regional Development'' including economic growth, human development and sustainability, inclusion, resilience and prosperity; The fifth section presents ``Towards a Smart Metropolitan Regional Development'' including human development, environmental sustainability and city prosperity; The sixth section, based on the development of the previous sections, presents the ``Spatial and Economic Design Strategies for a Smart Conakry Metropolitan Regional Development''.",

abstract="Hong Kong is a unique city state that, partly due to its strategic location in South-east Asia, has grown into one of the top-ranked global cities in terms of per capita GDP. Its mountainous terrain and limited supply of buildable land resulted early on in urban areas with extreme population densities. The compact urban form was further stimulated by using mass transit as the backbone of urban development. Different urban rail systems were integrated, and smart technology was introduced early on to stimulate its use. Today, Hong Kong has one of the highest public transport modal splits in the world. Hong Kong has developed high-density transit-oriented developments, but these TODs are not always well integrated into their urban contexts, creating barriers for pedestrians. Hong Kong also has a relatively high rate of telecommunication connectivity, which has facilitated the growth of the economy and enabled the population and businesses to be fully connected to the global economy.",

abstract="Eco-responsible cities have to ensure access for all, at all times, to clean, secure, and affordable energy. Investments in energy efficiency and sustainably managed renewable energy resources can only have beneficial effects. Renewables, the central pillar of the energy transition, have conquered most cities of the world. In 2015, renewables globally surpassed coal to represent the largest source of installed power capacity: they then continuously broke records. Still, this is not sufficient to cap temperature increase to 43{\textdegree}, less than 2 {\textdegree}C. Global emissions from energy reached their peak also in 2015. The world has inexorably entered an era of lower energy intensity. Offshore wind energy generation and ocean blue--green energy, including tidal and wave energy, can far extend possibilities on the scene of the future. Sustainable mobility and accessibility are fundamental for an equitable society and for linking the first and the last mile of all urban journeys to terrestrial and maritime networks and the broader world through integrated, smarter, and cleaner transport. This chapter offers an insight into evolving energy production and consumption patterns, and the concerted efforts to raise the bar of sustainability excellence and overcome national and supranational energy targets. Intelligent mobility and connected and automated driving will be essential for the shift towards post-carbon cities, making the most of digital technologies and speeding up the deployment of zero-emission alternatives. Automated eco-ships may also be a reality in the near future.",

abstract="City planning is drastically changing with regard to the way urban systems can function and be managed and developed in line with the goals of sustainable development. Marking and fueling this change predominately is the increasing use and application of big data and data-driven decision-making in urban analytics and planning to advance the contribution of cities to sustainability. This unprecedented shift has been instigated by the recent advances in data science and its becoming a more accessible tool to advocacy groups, more extensive data and their new sources being able to potentially allow key stakeholders to see and respond to various urban factors (mobility, transport, energy, environment, public health care, education, etc.) in real time, coupled with citizens emitting rich spatiotemporal data to an increasing extent through the use of various technologies. We refer to big data with respect to their humongous size and wide variety but pay particular attention to urban data, i.e., data invariably tagged with spatial and temporal labels; largely streamed from diverse sensory sources and stored in databases; generated routinely, automatically, and sporadically; and merged and coalesced in data warehouses for use at the citywide scale. This epitomizes a sea change in the data that we generate about urban systems as to what happens and where, when, how, and why in the urban environment. This is opening entirely new windows of opportunity for the application of analytical solutions and data-driven decision-making approaches into urban planning in terms of improving the performance of, and contribution to, the goals of sustainable development under what is termed smart sustainable cities. This chapter explores the real potential of big data and data-driven decision-making for revolutionizing or transforming the process of planning for the purpose of achieving the goals of sustainable development in the context of smart sustainable cities, focusing on different dimensions and functions of planning as well as their synergy and integration. We argue that the increasing proliferation and availability of urban data, coupled with the continuous integration of new and more extensive sources of such data as well as the evolving development of big data technologies, are increasingly enabling novel analytical solutions for, or sophisticated engineering approaches into, advancing the process of sustainable urban development, in addition to seamlessly integrating long-term strategic planning with short-term thinking about how cities can function and be managed in the context of sustainability. In addition, we believe that big data innovations entail how new data-driven transformations are facilitated and applied as well as diffused throughout urban systems, rather than simply denoting a significant growth in volume and variety of urban data.",

In the meantime, the basic and important health information related to the elder will be sent together with that request. Thus, the emergency service center can base on the elder's information to dispatch an available ambulance that takes the necessary medicines and equipment to the elder's house.",

abstract="Multiple kinds of sensors in smart homes have been used successfully and widely on various pattern recognition tasks. In order to detect user's activities of daily living (ADLs), an array of sensors have to be installed in many places in a smart home or armed upon a user's body. Here, we present an approach for collecting and detecting activities data only via a smart phone, which largely reduces the cost of setup in a smart home and energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents a pioneering work where a single-point smart phone is used to capture ADLs. The ADLs indoor are recognized by analyzing the data combination of sound, orientation, and Wi-Fi signals. This study engages real-life data collection, and the results from four test environments show that all of the ADL recognition rates are above 90 {\%}.",

abstract="With ever more of the world's population living in urban areas, cities face immense challenges ranging from providing basic human needs, to adapting to the impact of climate change, to improving the quality of life for its citizens. Addressing these issues, cities increasingly turn towards technology as the solution. Advancement in information communication technologies allows the collection of data from urban infrastructure systems relating to people's consumption patterns, therefore enabling resource optimization and more informed decision making. The adoption of technology however also brings many challenges. Taking leads from the academic literature on smart and---more recently---cognitive cities as well as the authors' own experience in implementing technology infrastructure, the chapter explores the role of technology in helping to create successful cities, analyses the challenges that technological solutions carry, and provides a roadmap to the adoption of technology. The chapter concludes that technology is simply one part of city systems. To create truly livable cities, city administrators need to develop a vision, engage the community and stakeholders, and undertake their due diligence in adopting technology.",

Relevant metrics and standards in AAL design are highlighted. A comparative prospective of these metrics and how they are applied in recent studies and systems are also discussed. The paper presents a categorization of those technologies based on their selection of the spatial information to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationship between spatial modeling and the accuracy of these technologies.

So, that's the threat model I'm primarily aiming at. Last year I was working for a large software company. They had an insurance company as their client. They were trying to get data on people out of the on-board diagnostics. Not only the speed, et cetera, to do pay-as-you-drive insurance, but also the location information from the on-board diagnostics. This is similar to the government U-turn on health privacy that we heard about from Ross. And most of the times, the software that lies in my car (or in my toaster) I do not own or control. It's owned by the company who manufactured it. Like, the Jeeps that John Deere manufactures, they say that the software is owned by them. The user has no access, no control, nothing to do with it. But forensics is a important concern. If my car (or my toaster) happens to kill me, then the investigator should be able to find out exactly what happened when I was murdered.",

The framework we present connects gesture recognition results with control commands for appliances in a smart home that are accessed through a middleware based on the ISO 24752 standard URC (Universal Remote Console). Gesture recognition is realized by applying three dimensional acceleration sensor information of the WiiMote from Nintendo. This information is trained to a toolkit for gesture recognition that implements machine learning algorithms well known from speech recognition. Our study focuses on two interaction concepts with the aim to exploit the context and special home scenarios. This serves to reduce the number of gestures while in parallel retaining the control complexity on a high level. A user test, also with older persons, compares both concepts and evaluates their efficiency by observing the response times and the subjective impressions of the test persons.",

Logic is seen, on the one hand, as carrier of information, and, on the other hand, as including mechanisms for inference as underlying decision-making. The ontology and logic for the framework is based on a non-classical typing system where uncertainty is canonically developed in a category theory framework involving term monads both composed with other monads, and as viewed over other categories than just the category of sets. The main question is where uncertainty actually resides, so that they are canonically retrieved rather than amalgamated in ad hoc approaches.",

abstract="The population of older adults is increasing across the globe; this growth is predicted to continue into the future. Most older adults prefer to live in their own home, but many live alone without immediate support. Living longer is often coupled with health and social problems and difficulty managing daily activities. Therefore, some level of care is required, but this is costly. Technological solutions may help to mitigate these problems by recognising subtle changes early and intervening before problems become unmanageable. Understanding a person's usual behaviour when carrying out Activities of Daily Living (ADL) makes it possible to detect and respond to anomalies. However, current commercial and research monitoring systems do not offer an analysis of ADL and are unable to detect subtle changes. To address this gap, we propose the STRETCH (Socio-Technical Resilience for Enhancing Targeted Community Healthcare) sensor platform that is comprised of non-invasive sensors and machine learning techniques to recognise changes and allow early interventions. The paper discusses design principles, modalities, system architecture, and sensor network architecture.",

A common symptom of old age is cognitive impairment, which can in some cases lead to the inability of self-navigation. Numerous indoor navigation systems have proposed to solve such problems. However, previous developers have only to a minor extent included elderly in the design process, despite the user group's complex needs. The solution presented in this paper is based on using recognizable aids and abstractions to ensure that the new proposed system is something elderly users can relate to and feel comfortable with. Other solutions often require wearable modules, or constant interaction, whereas this system does not require any of the two. In addition to our solution we present five implications when designing an indoor navigation system for elderly people.",

Besides aspects of technical development and implementation, user acceptance of diverse stakeholders plays a major role for a successful rollout and sustainable adoption of those technologies. So far, user acceptance research in this context has concentrated mostly on age-related issues. In contrast, disabilities and related care needs have hardly been researched yet. The current study focused on persons having different experiences with disabilities and care needs. In a qualitative interview pre-study (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}9) and a follow-up quantitative online questionnaire study (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}279) perceived benefits and barriers, use conditions, and acceptance of AAL technologies were contrasted. Four user groups were under study: disabled participants, relatives of disabled persons, professional caregivers, and, as a control group, persons without experience with disabilities. Results indicate that disabled and care-needy people show a higher acceptance and intention to use an AAL system than not-experienced people and especially professional caregivers. The motives for acceptance and rejection differ strongly regarding user diversity as well. The results contribute to a better understanding of user-specific acceptance of smart home and AAL technologies and show that the integration of diverse user groups into the technologies' design and evaluation process is necessary.",

On the other hand, the service robots forecast should take into account aspects that influence adjacent markets such as the economic crisis in the construction industry. In addition, demographic factors, the lack of skilled workers and rising life expectancy are aspects to bear in mind in the forecast. Therefore, the scientific community must propose a roadmap to settle the technological challenges that are appearing in an unstructured and dynamic environment such as the home.",

The interest and biomedical research in the modern society is intensively directed on disease prevention, early diagnostic and life quality improvement as well as on development of personalized healthcare especially for those chronically ill, disabled and for the aging population. The aim of the new approach in healthcare is not only to monitor and improve health of individuals, but also to increase their independence, mobility, safety and social contact through increased communication, inclusion and participation using available technologies. A large number of new medical devices for health monitoring, home care, wellness promotion, gerontotechnology, etc. have to be designed, tested and adopted to meet the special needs and demands of different population groups. These new devices for telemonitoring and telediagnostics create large amount of health related information, in most cases from sensors organized into body sensor networks. The information has to be processed, transmitted from the point of care to the healthcare system in a safe way and after managing the information in an appropriate and intelligent manner, decisions related to the persons health are to be made. This paper brings an overview of some solutions presented in literature as well as our own development of intelligent mobile monitoring devices.",

One strategy to meet these challenges is an increased focus on self-care via use of broader social networks and seamless integration of applications with lifestyle activities, particularly for people with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. There has also been a rapid increase in a range of technologies for connecting different components of the health system and delivering services through smartphones and connected devices.

The focus of this paper is on the contribution of fine scale datasets in policy making by use of Spatial Micro Level Analysis of building-structures data. This approach enables the exploration of the spatial pattern in finer scale, setting the ground for a better insight in micro level dynamics. The proposed approach was applied in an insular area---Samos, Greece---in an effort to study two defining issues of islands' territory development in the Aegean Sea nowadays, namely informal settlements' expansion as well as spatial distribution of fire events, which are closely linked to pressures exerted on such areas by current development patterns as well as climate change impacts. The scope of this work is to illuminate underlying mechanisms of attraction/repulsion of informal housing; and identify the relationship between points of fire ignition and populated areas. Output of such an approach can feed decision-making processes and support more ``smart'' policy directions for coping with challenges of both island territory development and fire-related risks.",

Today, about 98 percent of micro processors are embedded, connected with the outside world through sensors and actuators. They are increasingly connected with one another and the internet. The physical world and the virtual world --- or cyberspace --- are merging. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being developed that are part of a globally networked future world, in which products, equipment and objects interact with embedded hardware and software beyond the limits of single applications. With the help of sensors, these systems process data from the physical world and make it available for network-based services, which in turn can have a direct effect on processes in the physical world using actuators.

abstract="Online Social Networking has become one of the biggest successes of the Internet. Facebook is the most popular service with over 1.23 billion users. Online Social Networks have the potential to combat feelings of social isolation amongst the aging population. Nevertheless, many older people do not use online social networks given the barriers resulting from a lack of understanding and perceived usefulness. This paper presents the findings from a ten week training course were participants were trained in the use of Facebook and EasiSocial, a newly introduced web application which displays Facebook in a manner which is more suitable for older people. An evaluation study was undertaken of both applications in an effort to gain insight into the reasons why older people (50--80 years old) do not use social media. Findings demonstrated that EasiSocial was statistically easier to learn and easier to use than Facebook and therefore potentially helpful to increase the adoption of Social Media technologies.",

On the one hand, perceived safety can be supported by adequate surveillance technologies (e.g., cameras), however, the systematic use of surveillance technologies undermines individual privacy needs on the other hand. In this empirical study, we explore users' perceptions on safety and privacy in the context of surveillance systems. In order to understand if the acceptance of surveillance depends on usage contexts, surveillance technologies in the urban were compared to the medical context. Using an online survey, 119 users were requested to indicate their acceptance regarding different types of surveillance contexts and technologies, differentiating perceived benefits and barriers as well as safety and privacy needs. We investigate acceptance differences towards surveillance technologies at various locations (private and public) as well. In this paper, we especially explore the impact of different surveillance contexts, locations and individual perceived crime threat on the acceptance of surveillance technologies and on the needs for privacy and safety.",

A set of examples as practical demonstrations of real computer usage by elderly people illustrates the issue on the national scene. The research was run to explore the computer literacy in elderly people from three perspectives, roughly corresponding to three kinds of elderly people reflecting their physical and mental state. Findings from the surveys which were conducted with a group of elderly respondents in the senior homes and findings from the interview with a young lector teaching old generation show the issue in the local city environment. A question on benefits of organized course for the elderly from the questionnaire explores the survey from four perspectives and brings enriching findings. Findings from literature review correspond to findings gained from the research.

Security systems have been designed for remote exploration and control, however, these still lack the simplicity needed by elderly and disabled. The majority of elderly people find the control of such systems laborious. This highlights the need for usable designs that take into consideration the cognitive limitations of this category of people. This paper contributes towards this problem through the introduction of a novel vehicular Remote Exploration Surveillance Robot (RESBot), capable of monitoring in real time the environment in response to events. The interaction with the system is achieved through natural language commands and hence, provides improved usability over traditional approaches. Results from the experimental usability evaluation of the RESBot system revealed considerable improvement over conventional home security systems.",

abstract="Rising care needs, higher proportions of older, diseased, or disabled people, and an increasing deficiency of qualified care staff due to demographic changes are major challenges in western societies. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies represent one approach to face these challenges. Besides technological developments and implementations, focusing on user acceptance (including diverse stakeholder perspectives) is important for a successful rollout. As the most previous studies focus on age-related issues, this paper emphasizes especially on people with care needs due to a disability. In particular the acceptance of an AAL system is investigated considering the trade-off between perceived benefits (e.g., increasing autonomy) and perceived barriers (e.g., invasion in privacy, to ``abandon'' data security). Using a quantitative online questionnaire, decisive use conditions are identified, and the trade-offs and AAL-acceptance are evaluated comparing four user groups: ``healthy people'' without experiences with disabilities, disabled people, family members, and professional care givers. Results indicate that experience with disabilities influence the acceptance and relevant use conditions of AAL systems as well as the trade-offs between benefits and barriers. The results demonstrate the relevance to include diverse user groups (age, diseases, disabilities) and their specific needs and wishes into the design and evaluation process of AAL technologies.",

abstract="The main objective of Ambient Assisted LivingAmbient Assisted Living(AALAAL) is to offer high performance and easier ways of personalized services, such as health monitoring, mobility training devices, and socially assistive technologiessocially Assistive Technologies(ATs). Nowadays, the ageing population, the high costs for the individual treatment in nursing homes, and the importance that the individuals increasingly necessary to be self-supporting all motivate development of intelligent hardware (i.e. ATs) for safe and independent living. However, AAL related to ambient intelligence (AmIAmI), together with the wide spectrum of ATs, is too heterogeneous and hence difficult to handle. In this context, managing the adaptable embedded software development has become more important, which provides guidance for the organization of a software system including the set of significant decisions, the selection of the structural elements, their relationships to each other, and composition of these elements into progressively larger subsystems, etc. In this chapter, we centre our attention from the perspective of computer science, particularly, we focus on the proposal of software reference architecture (SRASRA) for the development, standardization, and evolution of system architectures of AAL. The main aim of this work tends to justify that how embedded software development can be better managed via the proposed approach. The ultimate goal would be trans-domain applicability of the adaptable embedded software system.",

abstract="The SOPRANO (Service-oriented programmable smart environments for Older Europeans) project was an EU-funded project to develop an ambient assisted living (AAL) system to enhance the lives of frail and disabled older people. A major aim of the project was to shift away from `technology-push' and `problem-focused' approaches to user-driven approaches and map out an AAL system that will provide practical benefits for users in their everyday lives. The SOPRANO project involved users at all stages in the iterative development of an AAL system. This paper presents the main findings from the study, reflects on the key challenges in adopting a user-centred approach, and identifies some of the barriers to the widespread implementation of AAL systems within the spectrum of care for older people.",

They generate partial partitions and cooperate to obtain a set of patterns. The patterns are used at a personal level, for example to raise an alert, but also to evaluate global risks. These data are dynamic; the system has to maintain the built patterns and has to create new patterns. Therefore, the system is adaptive and can be spread on a large scale.",

During this time, Internet evolution created lots of opportunities, but many of those were not sound and that led us to the dot-com bubble. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Western world experienced a deep recession and so did the sector of telecommunications. On the same time Internet started to recover from the dot-com-bubble period and became the perfect medium for startupsStartup. In that period, the evolution of Internet has `commoditized' telecommunications that served mainly as a medium and not as an innovation vehicle.

To ground our design, we used design thinking as a guideline process. We evaluated the prototype using qualitative analysis of interview data. The findings show that the prototype motivated people grouping food and increased their awareness of the availability of food items in the fridge, the prototype also encouraged people in using food before expiration date. This paper offers three main contributions. Firstly, we identified three major problems that lead to domestic food waste. Secondly, we proposed a new design to address the problems. Thirdly, we applied design thinking as a design method to solve problems that related to domestic food waste.",

The proposed method introduces a new concept called activity zone which represents the location and the area of an activity that can be done by a user. By using this activity zone concept, the proposed scheme uses Markov Logic Network (MLN) which integrates a common sense knowledge (i.e. area of each activity) with a probabilistic model. The proposed scheme can utilize only a positioning sensor attached to a resident with/without power meters attached to appliances of a smart environment. We target 10 different living activities which cover most of our daily lives at a smart environment and construct activity recognition models. Through experiments using sensor data collected by four participants in our smart home, the proposed scheme achieved average F-measure of recognizing 10 target activities starting from 84.14 {\%} to 94.53 {\%} by using only positioning sensor data.",

abstract="Pervasive computing, also known as Internet of ThingsInternet of Things, or Ubiquitous ComputingUbiquitous computing, describes the emerging trend of seamlessly integrating computing into the everyday physical world. Examples of pervasive computing systems include: self-driving carsSelf-driving car, smart homesSmart home, navigation systemsNavigations systemfor disabled people, and environmental monitoring systems. In this chapter, we will take a first glance at such systems and identify their properties and basic components. An essential feature of these systems is their context-awareness, meaning that they determine circumstances (time, location, ambient temperature, emotions, seismic activity, etc.). In order to extract this context, a pervasive computing system must sense signalsSignalsfrom the environment and then process them. Consequently, based on the inferred context and an internal process model, the pervasive computing system takes intelligent decisions and acts upon the same environment. Context inferring, reasoning, and decision making are the tasks of a software agentSoftware agent, or controllerController. In many cases, more computer systems work together behind the scenes, exchanging information in a transparent way, in order to deliver a service to the user. To summarize, a generic pervasive computing system consists of sensors, actuators, software agents (controllers), and communication modules. Its core properties are context-awareness, implicit human--computer interaction, seamless networking, autonomy, and intelligence. The highest ideal of making computing naturally embedded in our lives cannot, however, be achieved by merely solving technical problems. Acceptance and trust of pervasive computing also requires solutions to legal, ethical and usability challenges.",

It describes methods how multimedia and virtual reality is able to assist their work. These include the areas how multimedia and virtual reality can help the patients everyday life and their rehabilitation. In the second part of the chapter we present the Virtual Therapy Room (VTR) a realized application for aphasic patients that was created for practicing communication and expressing emotions in a group therapy setting. The VTR shows a room that contains a virtual therapist and four virtual patients (avatars). The avatars are utilizing their knowledge base in order to answer the questions of the user providing an AI environment for the rehabilitation. The user of the VTR is the aphasic patient who has to solve the exercises. The picture that is relevant for the actual task appears on the virtual blackboard. Patient answers questions of the virtual therapist. Questions are about pictures describing an activity or an object in different levels. Patient can ask an avatar for answer. If the avatar knows the answer the avatars emotion changes to happy instead of sad. The avatar expresses its emotions in different dimensions. Its behavior, face-mimic, voice-tone and response also changes. The emotion system can be described as a deterministic finite automaton where places are emotion-states and the transition function of the automaton is derived from the input-response reaction of an avatar. Natural language processing techniques were also implemented in order to establish highquality human-computer interface windows for each of the avatars. Aphasic patients are able to interact with avatars via these interfaces. At the end of the chapter we visualize the possible future research field.",

abstract="Sensor networks are becoming popular nowadays in the development of smart environments. Heavily relying on static sensor and actuators, though, such environments usually lacks of versatility regarding the provided services and interaction capabilities. Here we present a framework for smart environments where a service robot is included within the sensor network acting as a mobile sensor and/or actuator. Our framework integrates off-the-shelf technologies to ensure its adaptability to a variety of sensor technologies and robotic software. Two pilot cases are presented as evaluation of our proposal.",

However, bringing all necessary aspects together to finally bring a product successfully to the market is challenging, as many researchers in the field have experienced over the last years. It means to tackle the technical issues arising, very closely study the potential customers getting to know their needs, their barriers of acceptance and knowing how to creating value for them and to eventually market, sell and ship the final product to them. We believe that only a joint effort of an interdisciplinary team involving technology, human sciences and business partners will have a chance of success.

However, home nursing is a resource demanding activity stretching medicare to its limits. In this situation, new technology can help. Reflective assistance is concerned with the construction of flexible `smart' systems that control the eldercare environment, adapting the ambient to the needs of individuals. New technology transforms a living space to a helpful residence assistant that observes inhabitants and offers aid or calls for it in the case of need. To achieve this goal, systems must be capable of monitoring the behavior of the elderly people and of responding to dynamic changes in their performance or physical and psychological situation.

One response to this unfolding situation has been to direct research effort towards Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), specifically, its enabling technologies. A critical impediment to the deployment of such systems remains the accurate and timely identification of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). This paper advocates a minimalist approach to ADL recognition; rather than capturing all possible ADLs, the reliable identification of a select subset of ADLs may prove sufficient for many categories of AAL services.

However, the success of the technology and acceptance of it by the target users will be dependent on both function, i.e., whether it provides a worthwhile service, and the user experience, i.e., how easy it is to achieve the intended function. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in human-computer interaction (HCI), in the context of our experience with two applications designed to support older adults. The first is an in-home sensor system for detecting early signs of health changes and managing chronic health conditions. The second is an interactive remote physical therapy system that connects a therapist in the clinic with an older adult in the home. An overview of each application is presented.

abstract="As you learned from open innovation, partnerships accumulate knowledge and accelerate innovation and growth. This chapter builds upon research on value constellations and their role in open innovation as an iterative model with the ability to create an ecosystem. Innovation ecosystems that are strategically linked through firms to foster idea generation, co-development, and collaboration are explored. As the first, we introduce hyperconnectivity as one fundamental principle of a business ecosystem. The world is a digital network, characterized by interdependency and integrated collaboration where everything is connected; hence, value can only be generated through mutual exchange. We broaden your understanding about how incumbents, fintechs, and non-banks link financial services to create ecosystems that provide clients with new experiences and added value. By tapping into the Silicon Valley, as the case in point of a geographically localized ecosystem, we introduce other smaller ecosystems relevant for blockchain like the Crypto Valley. The financial inclusion ecosystem of Ningbo represents how they can be used for developing rural areas and fighting poverty. In contrast, highly efficient cross-sector ecosystems that emerged in China out of the Alibaba Group became rapidly a dominant force also because they are increasingly spreading their reach into financial services. Based on our research, we discuss the success factors of an ecosystem incubator. Like economic areas and alliances, we assume global competition will be between ecosystems without borders of sectors rather than companies.",

Examples of societal impacts are ``creative disruption'' in economy and society, the gradual democratization of the Internet via open-source software and the expansion of ``citizen science''; the broadening of the global information infrastructure built of participatory communities of users of shared content; evolution of ``consumer robotics,'' and conceptualization of computing as services and thus dependent upon the co-evolution of information technology with ``rules''---with impacts on future policymaking and governance.

AAL systems exploit information and communication technologies (ICT) in the assistance to carry out daily activities, health and activity monitoring, enhancing safety and security and getting access to social, medical and emergency systems. These ICTs are in the form of smart systems, which are physical objects that are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, enabling them not only to intercommunicate with one another, but also to exchange information with people and react to their environment. This paper is on a low-cost technology customised to the South African environment to support ambient assisted living. The technology takes advantage of South Africa's digitalisation programme to provide broadband access in the support of AAL. Digital television as a gateway to internet access, wireless mesh networks for communication, motes for machine to machine communication and smart phones are the technologies supported in this architecture. A survey of AAL technologies was conducted and features of these systems that would be useful in defining our architecture identified. These features contribute to the development of an architecture for AAL. This research feeds into extending the body of knowledge on AAL technologies.",

The three strands of the proposed European open governance setting, consisting of open data, open service and open process, are examined, as is the conceptualization of government as an open source service platform as well as a broader platform for collaboration between all societal actors. The purpose is to support societal-wide innovation for tackling pressing societal challenges where the role of ICT is seen more broadly than has traditionally been the case, i.e. as a general purpose technology.

abstract="In today's ageing societies, the proportion of elderly people living alone in their own homes is dramatically increasing. Smart homes provide the appropriate environment for keeping them independent and, therefore, enhancing their quality of life. One of the most important requirements of these systems is that they have to provide a pervasive environment without disrupting elderly people's daily activities. The present paper introduces a CBR agent used within a commercial Smart Home system, designed for detecting domestic accidents that may lead to serious complications if the elderly resident is not attended quickly. The approach is based on cases composed of event sequences. Each event sequence represents the different locations visited by the resident during his/her daily activities. Using this approach, the system can decide whether the current sequence represent an unsafe scenario or not. It does so by comparing the current sequence with previously stored sequences. Several experiments have been conducted with different CBR agent configurations in order to test this approach. Results from these experiments show that the proposed approach is able to detect unsafe scenarios.",

In this paper, we present the results of two user studies that ascertain the views of elderly people and their informal carers regarding the acceptability and benefits of in-home monitoring technologies: (1) concept mapping coupled with brainstorming sessions, and (2) questionnaires. We then discuss how these requirements affect the design of our monitoring system.",

Firstly the room or house wherein the patient lives has been equipped and saturated with a host of multifaceted, multi-channel, multimedia, and multimodal sensors / actuators, robots, displays, appliances etc. Another noteworthy development is the powerful emergence of communication protocols and connectivity solutions, web-enabled devices, device-specific and agnostic services. To enable these diverse participants, to find one another, correspond and collaborate together dynamically and cognitively to understand the prevailing situation and needs of the patient, conceive and construct composite services for patient-centric, sophisticated and smart.

In addition, the vast amount of data produced leads to increased levels of computational complexity when trying to ascertain the underlying behavior of the inhabitant.

abstract="Smart Interactive Textiles combine the warmth and omnipresence of textiles in our everyday lives with the benefits of modern information and communication technologies. The potential of innovation is not only based on technical ingenuity, but also on the consideration and embedding of peoples' fears, requirements, desires, and wishes regarding these innovative technologies. Thus, the development of smart interactive textiles requires the expertise of various disciplines. Foremost, appropriate conductive yarns must be selected and integrated into conventional fabrics. Sensors and actuators must be embedded in textiles in a way that they could be used as a user interface. The design of these textiles should meet human needs and should enable an intuitive, easy to learn, and effective interaction. To meet these requirements, potential users should be part of the development and evaluation processes of innovative smart textiles. In this article, we present a research framework that integrates several interdisciplinary perspectives (interface design, textile technology, integration and automation, communication and human factors). We realized three functional smart textile demonstrators (curtain, chair, jacket). We report on the results of this interdisciplinary research project as well as the research questions and key findings of the individual partners. In summary, this article demonstrates that interdisciplinary cooperation, user-centered and participatory design, and iterative product development are necessary for successful innovative technologies.",

abstract="The world is going through a massive urbanization process with the consequence that for the first time in history physical mobility is regressing. If nothing changes, the growing number of cars and its associated problems---traffic jams, high pollution levels, greater health problems, high number of fatalities, and injuries---will become unacceptable to society. Salvation will need to come from new transportation technologies, changes in work patterns, and in our personal choices on transportation means that the e-revolution can bring. Under the convergence of IT and wireless telecom, and associating the increase in power electronics together with the improvement in battery performance, fantastic new opportunities are being unleashed to reduce energy consumption and increase transport capacity, while improving the passengers' journey experience. Furthermore, in the connected cities, the ``Internet of things'' applied to the transportation environment will create a complete set of new technologies and service offerings. Machine to Machine, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle to Infrastructure communications are a few of these technologies that will allow for the advent of the unmanned vehicle society. Unmanned trains are already being deployed throughout the world and buses as well as cars will follow suit. This first chapter will give an overview of the main principles and trends that affect transportation. It will provide the readers unfamiliar with transportation challenges, a vision on how e-mobility technologies are being developed to help society apprehend such fundamental changes. It will show which features of society will be impacted by these new technologies. There will be quite a few, as the mobility revolution will disrupt the transport market as we know it, bringing opportunities and threats for many potential actors. Once cars are electric, unmanned, and managed by fleet owners there will be no differentiation between public and private transport. Taxi drivers will disappear but their services will thrive. By proposing journeys for one-fourth of the current taxi ride cost, fleets of autonomous cars will start competing with buses and light metro cars on price. As cars are more comfortable and offer more direct rides, public transport users might decide to change their transport behaviors. Furthermore, multi-points to multi-points transport services with mini vans or big cars will drastically reduce bus attractiveness. At one point in time, transport authorities will just conclude that rather than subsidizing big buses or tramways that run empty, it will make more sense to introduce such services, especially outside peak hour. In other worlds, not only can't car manufacturers ignore the e-mobility revolution but bus and light train manufacturers are also forced to understand how their own business will be affected by such revolution in the car industry. After all, one of the principles we will see in this chapter is that all transportation means are competing against each other.",

abstract="To meet the challenges of population ageing, currently is one of the most striking political and societal tasks in nearly all European countries. Population ageing can be regarded as both drivers for social change as well as point of departure for social innovations which are seen as one of the adequate answers to tackle with its challenges. This paper starts with our own understanding of social innovation. Secondly we describe population ageing in its different challenges for both the ageing population as well as for the society as a whole. It will be shown that population ageing affects more or less all sectors of society and in consequence asks for cross-sector policy approaches. The special focus of this paper is to look at social innovations answering to population ageing in the context of the ``productivity discourse''. In doing this we are presenting the integrated use of technology and social services in order to support independent housing/living at home even in the case of being needy of care as an example of age-related social innovation. In the wake of population ageing new potentials for social innovation are generated which are insofar of essential importance as there are many new products and services developed especially for the elderly, which support `independent living' in old age. Moreover, at the same time they generate positive effects on economic growth and employment (market innovation) which will be discussed under the heading of `Silver Economy'. In this context networked living (or: Ambient Assisted Living -- AAL) will be presented as a special type of social innovation being at the interface between technology and social services. Networked living is not only understood as integration of information and communication technologies but also as social cross-linking of different industries, technologies, services and other key players.",

To translate these good governance ideologies into practical implementation, it is necessary to ensure the achievement of development targets defined as Sustainable Development Goals such as no poverty, zero hunger, and complete gender equality (SDGs, UNDP, 2015). Further, to achieve these development targets in a sustained manner, converged governance efforts are required at the grassroots, which in turn would inevitably result in the generation of continuous baseline data. This colossal amount of data thus generated at the grassroots when coupled with unstructured citizens' data generated through other digital devices holds immense potential to revolutionize governance processes by providing a foundation for data-backed decision making. Hence, such structured baseline data and unstructured citizens' data must be continuously combined and analyzed by application of big data analytics and other emerging ICTs (information and communication technologies).",

abstract="One important class of applications for the Internet of Things is related to the need to gain timely and continuous situational awareness, like smart cities, automated traffic control, or emergency and rescue operations. Events happening in the real-world need to be detected in real-time based on sensor data and other data sources. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology to detect complex (or composite) events in data streams and has been successfully applied in high volume and high velocity applications like stock market analysis. However, these application domains faced only the challenge of high performance, while the Internet of Things and Mobile Big Data introduce a new set of challenges caused by mobility. This chapter aims to explain these challenges and give an overview on how they are solved respectively how far state-of-the-art research has advanced to be useful to solve Mobile Big Data problems. At the infrastructure level the main challenge is to trade performance against resource consumption; and operator placement is the most dominant mechanism to address these problems. At the application and consumer level, mobile queries pose a new set of challenges for CEP. These are related to continuously changing positions of consumers and data sources, and the need to adapt the query processing to these changes. Finally, proper methods and tools for systematical testing and reproducible performance evaluation for mobile distributed CEP are needed but not yet available.",

abstract="The omnipresence and familiarity of textiles in combination with the integration of invisible sensors, actuators, and information and communication technology under the term ``interactive digital textiles'' offer the potential of bridging the gap between age, the aging-population, and latest information and communication technology. Digital textiles are reaching maturity and first technology augmented cloths are becoming commercially available. However, little is known about the acceptance and projected use of digital textiles for/in home environments and whether acceptance is shaped by age, gender, expertise in interacting with technology, or other aspects of user diversity. In a survey with {\$}{\$}n=136{\$}{\$}participants, we identified and quantified factors that influence the adoption and rejection of a smart cushion as example for digital textiles. We found that attitude towards technology and attitude towards automation are decisive for the projected acceptance, while age plays a minor role. In addition, we provide a customer segmentation based on the projected use and provide detailed descriptions of adopters and rejecters as well as their model-based evaluations of the smart interactive cushion. The article concludes with open research questions and strategies for practitioners to leverage smart textile interfaces as basis for many innovative products in the future.",

abstract="Given the large amount of sensed data by IoT devices and various wireless sensor networks, traditional data services lack the necessary resources to store and process that data, as well as to disseminate high-quality data to a variety of potential consumers. In this paper, we propose a framework for Data as a Service (DaaS) provisioning, which relies on deploying DaaS services on the cloud and using a DaaS agency to mediate between data consumers and DaaS services using a publish/subscribe model. Furthermore, we describe a decision algorithm for the selection of appropriate DaaS services that can fulfill consumers' requests for high-quality data. One of the benefits of the proposed approach is the elasticity of the cloud resources used by DaaS services. Moreover, the selection algorithm allows ranking DaaS services by matching their quality-of-data (QoD) offers against the QoD needs of the data consumer.",

abstract="In the last decades, datasets have emerged as an essential component in the process of generating automated Activity Recognition (AR) solutions. Nevertheless, some challenges still remain: the lack of recommendations about which kind of information should be represented inside a dataset has resulted in the implementation of a variety of different non-standardized formalisms. On the other hand, this information is usually not sufficient to fully characterize the dataset. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a series of recommendations in the form of a dataset model with a well-defined semantic definition, for supporting those who are responsible for the creation, documentation and management of datasets. In addition, in order to better characterize datasets from a statistical point-of-view, we describe eight statistical analyses which should be included as additional measures within the dataset itself. We have validated our concepts through retrospectively analyzing a well-known dataset.",

Any entrant might drop messages by turning to the corresponding channel, modifying the information which leads to several security issues. In previous work, the database server had physical securities on specific strategies and adopted a flexible policy control while accessing the data. Cluster-based group send-receive model (GSRM) is proposed offering reliable, secure transmission among the sensor nodes in the networks. Blowfish algorithm, a cryptography standard, has been proposed incorporated with GSRM and provides greater security during message transmission.

The policy impact of city branding is emphasised more than its marketing dimension to show the interconnection between the sharing of communicative flows and political culture.",

As we need an efficient prediction model, we propose a recurrent output neural network model (RO-NN) combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) which surely monitors and predicts the state of the concerned elderly person. Furthermore, we propose a prediction algorithm ``Unusual Behavior Algorithm (UBA)'' dedicated to detect the unusual activities and hold us account in the dangerous state.",

abstract="The chapter delves into the ongoing debate on e-governance, concentrating on the relationship between language use and other dimensions of social life such as identity and belonging as they are discursively encoded online. It suggests that new media communication may work as a tool of social cohesion and inclusion. By looking at linguistic evidence, it explores the issue of the discursive construction of urban identities within and across different groups, the tensions between real and imagined communities that occur, as well as the rhetoric of multiculturalism and urban regeneration across different digital platforms, from official websites to the social web. The policy impact of city branding is emphasised more than its marketing dimension to show the interconnection between the sharing of communicative flows and political culture.",

abstract="Given the large amount of sensed data by IoT devices and various wireless sensor networks, traditional data services lack the necessary resources to store and process that data, as well as to disseminate high-quality data to a variety of potential consumers. In this paper, we propose a framework for Data as a Service (DaaS) provisioning, which relies on deploying DaaS services on the cloud and using a DaaS agency to mediate between data consumers and DaaS services using a publish/subscribe model. Furthermore, we describe a decision algorithm for the selection of appropriate DaaS services that can fulfill consumers' requests for high-quality data. One of the benefits of the proposed approach is the elasticity of the cloud resources used by DaaS services. Moreover, the selection algorithm allows ranking DaaS services by matching their quality-of-data (QoD) offers against the QoD needs of the data consumer.",

abstract="Nowadays Cyber-Physical Systems gain more and more attention in regard to the Industry 4.0 or Digital Transformation in general. These systems imply the tight integration of physical and software components and are becoming more complex, forming highly inter-connected systems-of-systems. Furthermore, as components and subsystems are becoming more intelligent, there is a need for a paradigm shift towards considering them as ecosystems of collaborative entities with growing levels of autonomy. There is, however, the lack of proper methodologies and support frameworks for the design of such systems. In this context a contribution to an approach for the development of Collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems is proposed. It introduces some core definitions, organizational and architectural aspects. The proposed approach is in line with the design science research methodology and is illustrated with some examples.",

abstract="A system modeling is presented for a Smart-home Healthy Lifestyle Assistant System (SHLAS), covering healthy lifestyle promotion by intelligently collecting and analyzing context information, executing control instruction and suggesting health plans for users. SHLAS is Multi-agent based. Each agent has three levels: the Goal Layer has business rules for representing agent goals; the Strategy Layer provides technical rules and processes for guiding how the agent reacts to events; the Component Layer is made up of components, some components are called by technical rules and processes in the Strategy Layer, some others are used for communicating with third party systems. This agent framework enables the customizability of agents in SHLAS. We also introduce an Ontology-based domain knowledge and context model to capture and represent the agents, and agent behavior which provides agents with reasoning ability. SHLAS helps users with healthy lifestyle promotion by tracking and analyzing their behaviors, and recommending health plans. The paper closes with an empirical evaluation of the approach from the point of view of customizability.",

Common automation capabilities in the field of domotics only presented the first building blocks for the indoor spaces of the future. In this framework, energy consumption requires a special treatment, due to the strident environment preservation issues that the society is facing nowadays. For this reason, new solutions are needed to deal with the increasing power requirements of indoor spaces. In this line, an intelligent building platform which embraces not only well known automation necessities of indoor spaces, such as automatic lighting, security, remote access, etc., but also novel concepts in the fields of context-awareness, resident tracking and profiling, and net-zero/positive energy building are considered in a new proposal: the PLATERO platform. This chapter provides a detailed background on building automation/intelligence and energy efficiency and then details the novel architecture of PLATERO, its main elements and energy efficiency subsystems, and describes the different prototypes developed and deployed in a reference energy-efficiency building.",

Our vision for the future of telehealth solutions is that they adapt their behavior to the needs, habits, and personality of the patient through user modeling and context awareness. The ontology will be our foundation for user modeling of patients in the telehealth domain, and hence it is one of the initial steps toward our vision. Compared to other ontologies within the domain, ours has explicit focus on: 1) personality traits of the patient, which is vital for fulfillment of our vision in term of adaptability, and 2) use of international standards to describe diseases, functioning and physiological measurement -- ICD, ICF and SNOMED respectively -- to promote interoperability with external systems. Besides being the foundation for user modeling, the ontology is a component in the Patient@home infrastructure, where it will ease the integration of applications to the platform, and facilitate semantic interoperability between the applications.",

Despite the new law and other measures of increased surveillance, the sexual crimes against women continue and have increased. This paper is based on a larger study carried out in Delhi, among the school and college students and also slum locality to understand their perceptions and experiences of safe and unsafe spaces in the city. There are differential experiences of the respondents depending on the geographical location, and the class they belong to. For majority sexual violence in some form is very common in their everyday life experience and for some definitely in memory. Patriarchal norms and misogynist culture makes a woman risk violence every day from harassment of eve-teasing to extreme forms of violence, like acid throwing and rape. Mere infrastructural changes and additional surveillance will only restrict women further, however, change in the mindset of the men, sensitivity towards gender equality and right to the urban spaces are pre-requisite for safer environment for the women.",

Based on a review of scientific literature, the output of European research projects and reports from consultancies, the result of this investigation provides a broad and comprehensive set of factors that influence, and will influence in the future, mobility and logistics. The set is composed of 29 trends organised under 9 larger categories covering economic issues, societal issues, urbanisation, the environment, the digital society, new business models, safety, security and the legislative framework. The present analysis has greatly benefitted from the concept of liquid modernity developed by Bauman that enabled a broad and complete view on the dynamics of society and mobility. It allows describing linkages between social and economic trends, and between society and technology, especially information and communication technology. Thus, the added value of this contribution is its systematic approach allowing to describe this complex topic in an exhaustive manner while focussing on links and dependencies.",

However, the development of smart devices was accompanied by many real-life problems such as violations of user privacy, supply chain integration, poor user experience and vague commercialization paths. Nevertheless, the introduction of the special media attributes of smart devices into the field of information dissemination was thought-provoking for journalists and theoretical researchers alike.",

abstract="Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature, this chapter takes stock of the dominant research themes on smart homes and their users, and the linkages and disconnects between these themes. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed in three groups: (1) views of the smart home---functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home---prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) user-related challenges for realising the smart home---hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an analytical framework that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. This analytical framework serves to organise, link, and integrate the empirical analysis in Chaps. 3--6of the book. More broadly, the analytical framework shows how research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between research themes and traditions.",

abstract="Security, privacy and dependability are crucial issues if one wants to build a real smart home. First, in addition to established home security requirements, smart home adoption requires to solve brand-new security vulnerabilities deriving from the automated facets of smart homes. Thereafter, pervasive computing and ambient intelligence allow to collect a lot of information, to analyze it to derive new facts, and make them explicit. Finally, systems that are usually safe and dependable can fail when their behavior is becoming controlled as the result of complex interactions between many intertwined information systems. Unfortunately, application developers in smart home environments are usually neither security experts, nor familiar with ethical and legal requirements related to privacy. Security patterns can help to anticipate, overcome, and document systematically these difficult issues in building pervasive information systems in smart homes for cognitively impaired people. In this paper, we illustrate how security patterns can be extended and applied to Smart Home to foster autonomy of elderly or cognitively impaired people, then, we sketch the structure of the catalog which will be populated with a few patterns.",

abstract="Analogies abound in the business literature as the competition among business consultants to find the latest silver bullet in organizational thinking increases. Josephine Green, ex-senior director of trends and strategy at Philips Design, draws the picture of pyramids and pancakes to demonstrate the impact of new technology on organizational model development (Green, 2007). Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom conjure up the twin metaphors of the starfish and the spider to contrast the supposedly revolutionary peer-to-peer `leaderless' model and the traditional top-down model (Brafman and Beckstrom, 2006). Other organizational specialists borrow from the theories of evolutionary biology, such as Richard Dawkins's selfish gene theory, to argue that ideas, like memes, have a life of their own in this networked organism, and morph, according to the principles of natural selection, across multiple nodes, as in some self-replicating environmental science experiment (Dawkins, 1990). Thus a new orthodoxy in organizational thinking has emerged whereby organizational experts claim to explain human behaviour within online social networks as if the phenomena observed had appeared by the power of some kind of magic. Even the acclaimed Charles Leadbeater We-Think model, which is arguably less gimmicky and more substantial than the analogies cited above, and which is widely used in educational and corporate circles, falls into the same trap of striving to encapsulate the complexity of new organizational principles in one simplistic, compelling, and mostly misleading, concept (Leadbeater, 2008).",

abstract="E-Governance or Smart Government is buzzword across Europe to improve interaction between government and stakeholders. Governments both at national and local level are making efforts to transform themselves into a well-connected entity that responds efficiently to the needs of its citizens by developing an integrated back-office infrastructure. Cities are implementing smart and innovative means to improve quality of life and enhance competitiveness. Various measures are being taken to provide transparent, efficient, innovative and responsive government through adoption of various Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools. Stuttgart, located in south-west of Germany is no exception which started its E-Government initiative a decade ago, has today crossed significant milestones. Various e-services platforms are created to inform and assist citizens and e-transaction platforms are created to reduce the burden on existing staff in various departments. These services have shown remarkable results in management of some areas such as waste, mobility, human resource, etc. These platforms are still evolving and being created and developed after a thorough research, planning and consultative process with various stakeholders. Stuttgart has been successful in extending the reach of services digitally to its citizens and promoting a sense of sustainability. This city takes care of wide spectrum of administrative, political and social services through diverse ICT and Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms. Stuttgart is hub of high-tech auto industry and also known for its advanced ICT industry and highly innovative green technologies. This sense of sustainability is also reflected in adoption of environmental friendly practices which are being supported by befitting e-democracy and E-Governance measures. The objective of this paper is to review process of formation of E-Government services in Germany and the key milestone related to development of E-governance in Stuttgart. An case of best practices in mobility is presented to ascertain if Stuttgart leads its way to be a smart city.",

abstract="Older people would like to live independently in their home as long as possible. They want to reduce the risk of domestic accidents because of polypharmacy, physical weakness and other mental illnesses, which could increase the risks of domestic accidents (i.e. a fall). Changes in the behaviour of healthy older people could be correlated with cognitive disorders; consequently, early intervention could delay the deterioration of the disease. Over the last few years, activity recognition systems have been developed to support the management of senior citizens' daily life. In this context, this paper aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art presenting a proof of concept where information on body movement, vital signs and user's indoor locations are aggregated to improve the activity recognition task. The presented system has been tested in a realistic environment with three users in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed method. These results encouraged the use of this approach in activity recognition applications; indeed, the overall accuracy values, amongst others, are satisfactory increased (+2.67{\%} DT, +7.39{\%} SVM, +147.37{\%} NN).",

The number of elderly people who require such care services is increasing rapidly, causing a parallel rise in the need for expert care providers. One of the solutions to this demand for expert care is an automatic health care system that may be integrated into a residence, but installing and operating such systems can be prohibitively expensive. To solve this issue, a cost-effective activity monitoring based health care system is proposed in this study. The system uses the infrastructure of a smart grid and a home network system in order to reduce the costs of installation and operation.",

The challenge for self-drive car is that a typical urban landscape is very hostile and highly unpredictable. One (very expensive) solution is to adapt the environment with the introduction of sensors in the landscape which are available to the decision-making processes in the car.

abstract="In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid surge in ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies due to a rapidly aging society. The aging population, the increasing cost of formal health care, the caregiver burden, and the importance that the individuals place on living independently, all motivate development of innovative-assisted living technologies for safe and independent aging. Among all areas, the development of assistive robots with potential application to health and elderly care is drawing a lot attention from both industry and academia. Several such prototypes (e.g., wearable assisted-walking device designed by Honda, and personal transport assistance robot designed by Toyota) have been made. These robots are inevitably supported by various algorithms and computational techniques. In this work, we provide an overview of applying emerging CI (i.e., non-conventional CI) approaches to various smart robot control scenarios which, from the author's viewpoint, have a great influence on various ambient assisted living (AAL) robot related activities, such as location identification, manipulation, communication, vision, learning, and docking capabilities. The innovative CI methods covered in this chapter include bacteria foraging optimization (BFO), bees algorithm (BA), glowworm swarm optimization (GSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM), intelligent water drops (IWD), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The findings of this work can provide a good source for someone who is interested in the research filed of AAL robot.",

abstract="An increasingly aging population fuels the need for appropriate care and services for the elderly and disabled. Age related diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), require close monitoring and assessment. A home-based assessment tool, which collects information on people's hand and finger movements, has been developed. It is intended that movement difficulties such as bradykinesia and rigidity can be identified through the use of this tool. Remote monitoring of this home based tool has the potential to decrease the number of clinic/hospital visits a person with PD requires. Two groups of 10 people took part in an evaluation of this system. One group were persons with PD and the other were without PD. Results showed that 70{\%} of the control group completed the tool within 30 seconds compared to only 30{\%} in the PD group. The tool endeavours to make the assessment of PD more objective.",

abstract="Welfare technology (WT) is often developed with a technical perspective, and little consideration is taken regarding the involvement of important ethical considerations and different values that come up during the development and implementation of WT. Safety, security and privacy are significant, as well as the usability and overall benefit of the tool, but to date assessments often lack a holistic picture of the WT as seen by the users. This paper suggests a user-centered ethical assessment (UCEA) framework for WT to be able to evaluate ethical consequences as a part of the user-centered aspects. Building on established methodologies from research on ethical considerations, as well as the research domain of human-computer interaction, this assessment framework joins knowledge of ethical consequences with aspects affecting the ``digitalization with the individual in the center'', e.g. privacy, safety, well-being, dignity, empowerment and usability. The framework was applied during development of an interface for providing symptom information to Parkinson patients. The results showed that the UCEA framework directs the attention to values emphasized by the patients. Thus, functionality of the system was evaluated in the light of values and expected results of the patients, thereby facilitating follow-up of a user-centered assessment. The framework may be further developed and tested, but in this study it served as a working tool for assessing ethical consequences of WT as a part of user-centered aspects.",

abstract="An Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environment is an integration of stand-alone assistive technologies, with elements of smart homes, and telehealth services. Successful development of this emerging technology will promote the ability for older people to live independently and age in place. This paper focuses on the socio-technical challenges associated with implementing the AAL market with specific reference to Canada. The strategy used to gather information was a case study design. Market facilitators include the vast Canadian geography, the number of older people living in rural communities, and the development of several provincial initiatives aimed at enabling seniors to remain independent. The principle of universality in Canada's healthcare system bodes well for these technologies, as AAL has the potential to assist in equalizing services to these communities. Barriers include fragmentation of the market, where in Canada more than 100 different health authorities serve individuals across ten provinces and three territories.",

Especially the processing of low-level sensor events as well as the integration of heterogeneous components--including the users--as process resources are limited in current workflow systems. In this work, we propose PROtEUS: an integrated system for process execution in cyber-physical systems. PROtEUS is able to bridge the gap between hardware-related processes and human-centered workflows. It enables the integration of sensor data from various sources into model-based processes, the flexible access to heterogeneous resources, as well as user interactions in processes.

A lot of EU projects focus on services that can be easy to access and affordable by elderly, enhancing the independency and autonomous living of the seniors. RAPP (EU-FP7) is addressing this need by offering a solution in the form of a software platform that will support the creation and delivery of robotic applications (RApps) targeted to people at risk of exclusion, especially older people.

In the context of our Geras Project, we propose a Model-Driven Engineering framework for handling high-level specifications that capture the concerns of elderly people still living at home. These concerns are related to concrete living issues, like being notified of a ringing phone for a deaf people, or receiving adequate assistance after a fall. The framework explicitly models three aspects: agent's goals, formally capturing users' concerns; abstract solutions, defining a canvas for answering the goal; and concrete solutions in terms of APIs or various combination of APIs, for their operationalisation.

Research has shown that lighting in various colors and intensities can be used to improve people's moods, e.g. through its effects on melatonin levels. This is especially interesting in the context of ambient assisted living and care environments where people are less mobile and spend long hours indoors. The presented work aims at creating a technical system that can detect an older resident's mood and consequently adapt the lighting in the room to either calm or activate the person. As part of the system's design process we conducted interviews with caregivers in different care settings (day care, stationary care and home care) to gather requirements for the system. The study provides insights into moods of seniors and their detection, which is formulated in a preliminary mood model, as well as design considerations for different living- and care-settings.",

It is suggested that the acquisition of ground truth should become a seamless operation incorporated transparently into the workflow of operations in these facilities. It is expected that with automation of collection, the increasing corpus of ground truth will lead to steady improvements in the detection rate and therefore the quality of automated monitoring and care provisioning.

abstract="The increasing ageing population worldwide imposes some new challenges to the society like the provision of dependable support while facing a shortage in the numbers of caregivers, increased health costs and the emergence of new diseases. As such there is a great demand for technologies that support the independent and safe living of the elderly and ensuring that they are not socially isolated. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have thus emerged to support the elderly people in their daily activities, while removing the need of caregivers being always physically present in order to look after the elderly. The current AAL systems are intelligent enough to take critical decisions in emergency situations like a fall, fire or a cardiac arrest, hence the elderly can live safely and independently. In this abstract, we describe our solution that aims at integrating all relevant functionalities of an AAL system, based on feedback collected from representative users. This work is carried out in the European Union project called CAMI (Artificially intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL).",

abstract="The growth in popularity of smart environments has been quite steep in the last decade and so has the demand for smart health assistance systems. A smart home-based prompting system can enhance these technologies to deliver in-home interventions to a user for timely reminders or a brief instruction describing the way a task should be done for successful completion. This technology is in high demand with the desire for people who have physical or cognitive limitations to live independently in their homes. In this paper, we take the approach to fully automating a prompting system without any predefined rule set or user feedback. Unlike other approaches, we use simple off-the-shelf sensors and learn the timing for prompts based on real data that is collected with volunteer participants in our smart home testbed.",

abstract="This chapter concludes the book by examining the potential for mainstreaming a climate co-benefits approach in urban policy, governance and finance to address climate impacts and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in India. The cities have a key role to accrue co-benefits as they have jurisdictional and functional responsibility for planning and provision of services. The five-year plans, sectoral policies and projects comprise the urban policy framework in India and past efforts have not paid much attention to climate co-benefits. It is only in the last decade that the programmes and policies have started paying attention to the climate co-benefits in their development agenda. There is a greater scope for mainstreaming a climate co-benefits approach into these policies and ensure their effective implementation at the state and Urban Local Body (ULB) levels. The governance and financing capacities of implementing agencies can play a key role in effective implementation of urban sector policies. The 12th Five Year Plan and the High Power Expert Committee Report have made suggestions for strengthening the governance and financing framework for promoting urban development, which needs to be implemented on a priority basis. The chapter presents the need and approach to internalize a climate co-benefit approach, discusses the key issues and suggests the way forward to mainstream co-benefits into the urban policy, governance and financing framework in India.",

A large number of studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle has become a global public health problem, which has a negative impact on human life. Unhealthy sitting posture can lead to many diseases. When people sitting for a long time, the unbalanced force may lead to some diseases such as sitting sores and lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spine injury etc. Therefore, it is necessary to study the pressure distribution in the sitting position. Smart seat and mobile application designed for sedentary people is an effective tool for the prevention of these diseases, the pressure center of the body posture can be detected and analyzed, in order to guide people to the correct posture, help prevent disease due to unbalanced posture.",

This can be attributed to uncertainty decision makers feel, about how to choose right applications of cyber-physical systems and if chosen how to implement these applications to the unique and specific needs of their organization. To address this problem this chapter introduces an application map which includes the spheres smart factory, industrial smart data, industrial smart services, smart products, product-related smart data and product-related smart services. Based on this model, the decision makers are provided a scheme of application fields for utilizing cyber-physical architectures adjusted to their unique business situation.",

To achieve this goal, we compile the evidence gathered in the respective European as well as the Asian and North American research communities and examine synergies, complementarities and existing research and implementation gaps. In order to illustrate, we also draw from our own research, such as research projects targeting the role of technology in long-term institutions, the potential and constraints of technology for cognitively impaired older adults, and the role of technology acceptance in general for aging well. This chapter concludes that technology can be seen as a major context able to infuse development in old age and closes with future research challenges.",

Digital technologies allows smart cities residents to communicate with a broad range of experts (e.g. bureaucrats, legislators, urbanists, etc.) that routinely use technical terminology seldom accessible to the layperson, or linguistic styles that are not immediately understandable. Although information technology should encourage citizen participation in governance at many levels, the different levels of knowledge possessed by the actors can lead to incomprehension, as well as social exclusion. Computational Intelligence approaches can be used in order to alleviate such difficulties and improve the efficiency of communication through automation and collective cognitive systems. In this paper we discuss how use of techniques such as CWW and Fuzzy Classifiers can be beneficial toward the reduction of the communication gap between citizens and government.",

abstract="Nowadays, more and more exhibition centers and store owners are deploying beacon devices to implement location-based services. However, the beacon technology can only provide one-way communication. If we need the smartphones to respond to the beacon messages, the smartphone users have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. In some cases the mobile Internet services may not be always available. Therefore, we develop an interactive positioning and tracking system based solely on the BLE technology. Specifically, we make the beacon devices capable of two-way communication. On one hand, our beacon devices can detect the presence of a specific customer at specific locations, and then the presence information can be sent to the application server via the BLE mesh network consisting of beacon devices. On the other hand, the application server can send a personalized location-based message to the customer, again via the relay of beacon devices. The benefit of our system is two-fold: not only the customers without Internet connections can enjoy the positioning services, but also the backend system can be aware of the presence of specific customers and track their real-time locations. Experimental results showed that our system is practicable with moderate transmission latencies in the BLE mesh network.",

Although most of the investigations in the recent years focused on remote monitoring and diagnostic efforts, rehabilitation too could be positively affected by the use of these solutions, since these small Smart Objects may enable novel quantitative approaches. In this paper, we present the preliminary efforts in designing a pediatric rehabilitation protocol based on Smart Objects and biofeedback, which we administered to a small sample of hemiplegic children. Despite the few treatments (not suitable to assess any change in the subjects' abilities), children enjoyed participating in the study, and the initial qualitative/quantitative results highlight that such approach could represent an interesting starting point to fuel the scientific and clinical discussion towards a Pediatric Rehabilitation 2.0.",

abstract="Smart homes provide many research challenges, but some of the most interesting ones are in dealing with data that monitors human behaviour and that is inherently both spatial and temporal in nature. This means that context becomes all important: a person lying down in front of the fireplace could be perfectly normal behaviour if it was cold and the fire was on, but otherwise it is unusual. In this example, the context can include temporal resolution on various scales (it is winter and therefore probably cold, it is not nighttime when the person would be expected to be in bed rather than the living room) as well as spatial (the person is lying in front of the fireplace) and extra information such as whether or not the fire is lit. It could also include information about how they reached their current situation: if they went from standing to lying very suddenly there would be rather more cause for concern than if they first knelt down and then lowered themselves onto the floor. Representing all of these different temporal and spatial aspects together is a major challenge for smart home research. In this chapter we will provide an overview of some of the methodologies that can be used to deal with these problems. We will also outline our own research agenda in the Massey University Smart Environments (MUSE) group.",

abstract="Rapid advances in information and sensor technology have led to the development of tools and methods for individual health monitoring. These techniques support elderly health management by tracking the vital signs and detecting physiological changes for the target population, such as the elderly and patients with chronic diseases. Two pilot studies were conducted to demonstrate the implementation of electronic wearable wellness devices and an all-in-one station-based health monitoring device at the community level in Hong Kong. Real-time and daily changes of key vital signs in elderly people recruited from a nursing home and a geriatric daycare center were collected. Preliminary analysis of the collected data provided insights into the characteristics of vital signs of the elderly from two centers, which could bring benefits to the management of healthcare services. Additionally, a personalized wellness forecasting system was built to identify the factors influencing the personal wellness of the elderly, by aggregating historical daily vital signs.",

This paper presents a Petri nets based strategy supporting behavioural modelling as well as performance analysis of Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSSs) covering uncertainty situations when the social factor is also playing an effective role in the performance of these systems. The integration and interaction of system components including computation, physics and social factors as a challenging part of these systems are considered. Petri nets models, augmented with dynamic time dependencies associated with transitions, are applied in a case study, and validated as a promising tool for modelling and analysis of these kind of systems.",

Data are fast accumulating on the significant role of the outdoor built environment and physical activity (and health). For populations such as older adults with (or without) mobility impairments, a poorly structured built environment can significantly restrict community engagement. Despite the fact that we spend most of our lives indoors, there is far less empirical evidence to discern features of the indoor environment that influence physical activity. There is a need to focus on buildings incorporating age-friendly designs to support ``ageing in place,'' to build homes (and communities) that nurture social interaction, and identify destinations and routines that encourage adoption of activity into daily life habits.",

abstract="Single-person households have appeared recently as one of new distinct family types in Korea and lived mainly small scales of studio apartments and flats. However, we expect that normal large scale of houses or apartments will be inhibited by the residents of them in Korea. Accordingly the demands for their home would become dynamic like those of the other family types because their housings will not be temporary choices. The research proposes a direction for the development of smart homes in Korea, especially, for single households with a focus on their home workspace. Based on the results of a case study, a home workspace was identified as the highest need of the single households. Thus, this research emphasizes the effective functioning of home workspace and suggests intelligent components for it by introducing enabling technologies and notions to the development of the smart homes.",

abstract="There is now a vigorous body of opinion that has recognised both the major demographic transitions that have taken, and continue to take, place in most countries in the world, and the ways in which the design of both products and the built environment can either aggravate or ameliorate the impact of some of the disabling conditions that come with ageing (Clarkson et al, 2003). Furthermore, there is recognition of the fundamental importance of research with older users, and of understanding the interaction between individual and environment or ``technology'' in its broadest sense. This chapter reports on a component of a multi-disciplinary research project that was concerned with the introduction and use of a wide range of AT* in existing (older) housing occupied by older people. The main aims of the research were, in conjunction with ten housing partners, to investigate the feasibility and cost of introducing AT in relation, on the one hand, to user needs and, on the other, to the age, type and standard of property. However, the extent to which AT can narrow the gap between the home environment and individual capacity, depends upon the willingness of older people to use AT. If AT is to be introduced on any significant scale to support care in the community of older people, it must be easy and effective to use, and be positively welcomed by older people themselves. A key element in the research was therefore to explore with older people their use and experience of a range of AT.",

This chapter aims to explore how families are/ could be supported through formally organized intergenerational programs across a broad array of geographies and contexts. To this end, the inter-connectedness of generations within families is acknowledged and these intergenerational programs---to support and complement the family---are briefly described. In the main, these programs focus on family support in two contexts: caring for older adults with chronic health conditions, and grandparents and other relatives raising children. Some principles and a range of examples on intergenerational strategies for supporting families in both contexts are also provided.",

Our study contributes to this field with a mixed-methods intervention study that combines a baseline and follow-up telephone survey with semi-structured interviews to evaluate the user experience and potentially identifies additional acceptance factors of e-care systems and relations among them. Different assistive technologies were tested and evaluated by three groups of participants: (1) older adults testing mobile and wearable devices and (2) informal carers who remotely monitored events recorded by e-care systems installed in the homes of (3) care receivers. The findings indicate heterogeneous needs and expectations these three groups have towards the use of e-care systems. Moreover, the results also unveil the fear of not getting help quickly in case of an emergency, and perception of safety and peace of mind as important predictors of the use of e-care systems among informal carers and care receivers. Indirectly, the results also reveal the importance of intervention and mixed methods design studies as a means of a more comprehensive understanding of acceptance factors of assistive technologies.",

This is followed by a vision of the future based on the view that the multiple technologies now available will continually undergo mixing and hybridization such that increasingly the home will become the basic unit of assessment and care provision in an environment of multifunctional ambient technology monitoring and health maintenance. Finally, key challenges to achieving this environment are described at the person level as well as the technical and systems level.

abstract="The market for domestic and service robots, which can help consumers in their homes, is growing rapidly. Privacy scholars have warned that the deployment of robots in the home can lead to serious privacy risks, since these robots come equipped with sensors that register the environment in which they operate, including the human beings present therein. Moreover, many modern robots are, or will soon become, connected to the internet. This means that they can pass on any data they record, and that they can also be hacked by outsiders. The privacy and security risks are significant with this novel type of technology. In this chapter I argue that attaching robots to the internet does indeed lead to serious privacy and security risks. But I will also argue that there is a straightforward solution that can contribute to eliminating many of these risks, which is left unaddressed in the current debate. Borrowing a term from the field of cybersecurity I will argue that consumer robots ought to be `air gapped', that is they ought not to be connected to the internet or the cloud---expect in a few exceptional cases where network connections are a critical requirement for robots to be able to function properly or effectively. I will explain what air gaps are, how they are used, and which strengths and weaknesses they have. Next, I will critically assess their use as a strategy to prevent privacy and security issues in domestic and service robots. I will argue that it is important to have a debate on the networked character of robots today, since we can now still prevent privacy and security problems in this novel technology, rather than having to remedy them once they are mass-marketed. This is why I propose to have a debate on privacy before design.",

Understanding the nexus between mobility, information and communication technologies and older people can help us design accessible and acceptable technologies to support well-being and health in older age. This matters because new ICT is increasingly relied on to support service delivery in both the public and private sectors. Older people are heterogeneous, with different attitudes, levels of income and education affecting technology uptake. Age-related cognitive and physical impairments can also impact on technology adoption. The chapter concludes with how age-friendly design principles can support active ageing.",

abstract="At the present time, 15{\%} of the growing world population is estimated to have disabilities and special needs. Disabilities can seriously limit participation in regular life activities, such as controlling home facilities, using transportation services, joining social events, accessing educational contents, to name but a few. With the advancement in ubiquitous and pervasive computing, context-aware systems (CAS) are gaining much attention and demonstrating a stronger association with applications for people with disability. Modern CAS tend to minimize user interactions with the system and provide seamless services, automated awareness, and ambient intelligence and monitoring. CAS for people with disability can detect the surrounding environment, identify an appropriate user interface, interact, and service the user depending on the situation. Nevertheless, a large number of investigations on CAS for people with disability are presented in the literature, limited systems are practically available in the market. In this paper, we survey the literature to thoroughly analyze, evaluate, and critique state-of-the-art research in accessible CAS. Systems are classified according to the type of disability; besides, many interaction models are examined and strategies for making CAS accessible are identified. The investigation confirms the need for frameworks that enable improving security aspects, better exploiting modern hardware systems, performing reliable verification, and further supporting system customization and adaptation.",

abstract="this essay examines the emergence of a `proto-industry' that is researching, designing, and building technology with a specific futures in mind. That future is one of a rapidly aging world in which technology plays a key role in supporting the needs and experiences of older people. This category of technologies is referred to as ambient assisted living technology, and it often takes form of ubiquitous computing, or Ubicomp, created for a particular type of older `user'. Despite the fact that this demographic aging is already a reality, and much of the technology required already exists, this industry typically frames its efforts in terms of a ``proximate future'' (Bell and Dourish 2006). Such a future is always just around the corner or coming into view over the horizon. In this brave new world, new technological capabilities and interaction models will allow older people to achieve their goals through seamless, ubiquitous computing experiences. I suggest that this frame of a proximate future creates a focus on technology development and overshadows the importance of social and cultural practice in the development of appropriate technological interventions.",

abstract="The Internet of Things, smart devices, connected health and ICT have the potential to enable people, carers and families to improve the quality of health and social wellbeing. One factor that can help people with physical or cognitive impairments to learn new skills and to be connected with the world, concerns accessible interaction with media devices, such as radios, TVs, tablets and smartphones. According to input received from stakeholders of Irish-based communities of people with different abilities, one of the main barriers for users relates to a reduced level of accessibility when controlling media devices. The aim of this work is to improve users' autonomy by providing tools that enhance users' abilities with media device functionalities through the use of configurable prototypes of media assistive controllers. The output of the work is a proof of concept version of a methodology that matches user ability profiles to configurations of the corresponding functionalities of media assistive devices according to the Universal Design approach. This framework enables people with different abilities to independently engage with a media controller, through a multi-level interaction approach. It also facilitates users who become proficient at using a device at one level to improve their capabilities to a more complex level, requiring additional users' interaction. Finally, it provides an example of how the ICF can be leveraged to suggest accessibility configuration parameters for devices of this type.",

To meet the resulting challenge, European healthcare systems need to take full advantage of new opportunities offered by technical advancements in ICT. The RADIO project explores a novel approach to user acceptance and unobtrusiveness: an integrated smart home/assistant robot system where health monitoring equipment is an obvious and accepted part of the user's daily life. By using the smart home/assistant robot as sensing equipment for health monitoring, we mask the functionality of the sensors rather than the sensors themselves. In this manner, sensors do not need to be discrete and distant or masked and cumbersome to install; they do however need to be perceived as a natural component of the smart home/assistant robot functionalities.",

The HCEE is placed within the economic flows of a bi-regional SAM for Italian economy which provides the data set for a CGE model where the hypothesis of involuntary unemployment is also considered. Two policy scenarios are then simulated to evaluate the impact of the policy reform in HCEE on total output and unemployment.

The use of mobile technologies---already prominent among many populations---can be used to raise awareness of the needs and responsibilities of the individual and can highlight opportunities to live in ways that are friendlier to others. Mobile technologies have great promise in connecting users to their environment, and a smart environment enhanced with technology that supports better living can improve the lives of individuals, groups, and the broader community. The goals of this work are toward encouraging: 1) increased awareness of information in the user's surroundings; 2) integrated control over factors in one's surrounding and home environments; and 3) increased ability to support sustainable living for both individuals and groups.

A representative national survey of over a thousand UK homeowners finds prospective users have positive perceptions of the multiple functionality of SHTs including energy management. Ceding autonomy and independence in the home for increased technological control are the main perceived risks. An additional survey of actual SHT users participating in a SHT field trial (see Chap. 1) identifies the key role of early adopters in lowering perceived SHT risks for the mass market. Content analysis of SHT marketing material finds that the SHT industry is insufficiently emphasising measures to build consumer confidence on data security and privacy. These multiple perspectives draw on insights from across the functional, instrumental and socio-technical views identified in the analytical framework for research on smart homes and their users (Chap. 2 and Table 2.1).",

abstract="Seven gerontechnology innovation projects spanning nineteen years were considered in terms of project activities, collaboration and management. The projects we considered were: PLANEC, OTIS, Care in the Community, SAPHE, SOPRANO, Smart Distress Monitor and COACH. Three interviews with project partners identified the nature and goals of the project, the composition of the team members, and the challenges, solutions, successes, and failures. Thematic analysis revealed three common themes spanning the projects which are likely to be issues in other technology innovation and research projects. The themes are navigating boundaries, succeeding at ``things you're not very good at'', and managing disparate teams. In this article we discuss the factors contributing to these thematic concerns, and present solutions that were helpful for the projects in the expectation that the knowledge generated from those working experiences is transferable to other projects that involve the intersection of technology development and social concerns.",

In this paper, we attempt to rectify this in consideration of context awareness and novelty detection for a smart home that monitors its inhabitant for illness and unexpected behaviour. We do this through the concept of the Use Case, which is used in software engineering to specify the behaviour of a system. We describe a set of scenarios and the possible outputs that the smart home could give and introduce the SHMUC Repository of Smart Home Use Cases. Based on this, we can consider how probabilistic and logic-based reasoning systems would produce different capabilities.",

By recognizing users` on-going activities in a smart home environment, we propose an interruptiblity-aware ES reminder system to facilitate behavioral changes for facilitating energy saving at home. This system provides an ES reminder (one kind of eco-feedback) in the event of an activity transition to avoid constantly disturbing user's on-going activities, and the content of an ES reminder is composed using two kinds of information visualization via ambient displays to improve readability.

abstract="Automated recognition of activities in a smart home is useful in independent living of elderly and remote monitoring of patients. Learning methods are applied to recognize activities by utilizing the information obtained from the sensors installed in a smart home. In this paper, we present a comparative study using five learning models applied to activity recognition, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses under different challenging conditions. The challenges include high intra-class, low inter-class variations, unreliable sensor data and imbalance number of activity instances per class. The same sets of features are given as input to the learning approaches. Evaluation is performed using four publicly available smart home datasets. Analysis of the results shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Evidence-Theoretic K-nearest Neighbors (ET-KNN) in comparison to the learning methods Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) performed better in correctly recognizing the smart home activities.",

abstract="The Florence project develops a robot for elderly that provides multiple Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Lifestyle services with a consistent user-interface. The project success is measured by the acceptance of these services by the user group. Enabling such service robotics in (smart) homes requires a robust and flexible platform to collect, enhance and distribute sensory information; and to manipulate the actuators in the environment. A key characteristic of such an environment is that sensors and actuators are not always available, are distributed, and are mobile (due to e.g. the robot and phone mobility). This dynamicity requires a loose coupling between services and sensors/actuators. The paper describes the design principles and high level architecture of the Florence platform that hides the distribution, availability and mobility aspects from the services, and sketches some challenges that lie ahead.",

First, we introduce Context Sensor Network (CSN). The CSN provides the raw environment information from the diversity of sensors. Second, data manager component is proposed to process the pre-processing in the raw data from the CSN. The data must be normalized and transformed in order to make the system more efficient. The last component is system repository that composes of three essential tasks for controlling the information in the system. In this paper, the ontology based activity recognition (OBAR) system is used to evaluate the data from proposed components.

abstract="Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used in activity recognition. Ideally, the current activity should be determined using the vector of all sensor readings; however, this results in an exponentially large space of observations. The current fix to this problem is to assume conditional independence between individual sensors, given an activity, and factorizing the emission distribution in a naive way. In several cases, this leads to accuracy loss. We present an intermediate solution, viz., determining a mapping between each activity and conjunctions over a relevant subset of dependent sensors. The approach discovers features that are conjunctions of sensors and maps them to activities. This does away the assumption of naive factorization while not ruling out the possibility of the vector of all the sensor readings being relevant to activities. We demonstrate through experimental evaluation that our approach prunes potentially irrelevant subsets of sensor readings and results in significant accuracy improvements.",

abstract="Smart homes offer considerable potential to facilitate aging at home and, therefore, to reduce healthcare costs, both in financial and human resources. To implement the smart home dream, an artificial intelligence has to be able to identify, in real-time, the ongoing activity of daily living with a fine-grained granularity. Despite the recent and ongoing improvements, the limitation of the literature on this subject primarily concerns the quality of the information which can be inferred from standard ubiquitous sensors in a smart home. Passive Radio-Frequency Identification is one of the technology that can help improving activity recognition through the tracking of the objects used by the resident in real-time. This paper builds upon the literature on objects tracking to propose a machine learning scheme exploiting statistical features to transform the signal strength into useful qualitative spatial information. The method has an overall accuracy of 95.98{\%}, which is an improvement of 8.26{\%} over previous work.",

abstract="Smart homes generally differ from other pervasive environments such as office environments. Homes are lack of system administrators to fix faulty services on the spot. Nevertheless, services in smart homes can be critical especially when they involve health and wellness services, since faulty services can lead to unexpected/undesirable consequences. Therefore, robustness and availability are two fundamental requirements for service management protocols or middleware at homes. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptive failure detection and recovery mechanism, namely, the Rotating Roll-Call-based Protocol (RRCP), for home environments. Failures of software components are detected efficiently with a roll-call-based algorithm in which the roll-caller is elected periodically. Adaptive techniques and reliable UDP are adopted to maintain home network stability. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is robust even under elevated failure rates.",

abstract="An algorithm for decoding commands spoken in an intelligent environment through iterative vocabulary reduction is presented. Current research in the field of speech recognition focuses primarily on the optimization of algorithms for single pass decoding using large vocabularies. While this is ideal for processing conversational speech, alternative methods should be explored for different domains of speech, specifically commands issued verbally in an intelligent environment. Such commands have both an explicitly defined structure and a vocabulary limited to valid task descriptions. We propose that a multiple pass context-driven decoding scheme utilizing dictionary pruning yields improved accuracy; this occurs when one deals with command structure and a reduced vocabulary. Each iteration incorporates the hypothesis of the previous into its decoding scheme by removing unlikely words from the current language model. We have applied this decoding method to a comprehensive set of spoken commands through the use of Sphinx-4, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). When decoding via HMM, multiple previous states are used to determine the current state, thus utilizing context to aid in intelligent recognition. Our results show that within a fixed domain, multiple pass decoding yields recognition accuracy. Further research must be conducted to optimize practical context driven decoding and to apply the method to larger domains, primarily those of intelligent environments.",

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems can greatly improve healthcare scalability and reach while keeping the user in their home environment. The work presented in this paper specifies, implements, and validates a smart environment system that aggregates Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The specification includes a reference architecture, composed by three modules, whose tasks are to automate and standardize the collection of data, to relate and give meaning to that data and to learn from it. The system is able to identify daily living activities with different levels of complexity using a temporal logic. It enables a real time response to emergency situations and also a long term analysis of the user daily routine useful to induce healthier lifestyles. The implementation addresses the applications and techniques used in the development of a functional prototype. To demonstrate the system operation three use cases with increasing levels of complexity are proposed and validated. A discussion on related projects is also included, specifically on automation applications, Knowledge Representation (KR) and Machine Learning (ML).",

For example, consider the smartness of systems to improve public health (canalisation), to enhance comfort (hypocaust heating, bagdirs), and even to serve as a form of entertainment.

abstract="Activity recognition aims at modeling the occupants' behavior by analyzing the sensor data collected from the smart environment. Though most of the activity recognition systems use supervised learning techniques for building such models there is a shift towards the unsupervised learning paradigm as the process of annotating and labeling the data is prone to errors. This paper proposes an Event Pattern Activity Modeling Framework (EPAM) to identify the occupant activity pattern from the sensor data by using an unsupervised machine learning approach and further analysis is done with a knowledge driven approach. In the context of smart environments, an activity is considered as a sequence of events that are generated continuously from the sensor data. The segmentation algorithm proposed in EPAM is used to identify appropriate event patterns for an activity that are then grouped together using a pattern clustering algorithm that presents a hierarchy of activities. The set of activities of the occupant, observed in a smart environment is not always sequential but is highly interleaved and discontinuous. The proposed algorithm accommodates this valid factor by an innovative use of the Jaro Winkler similarity measure. The hierarchy of activity generated by the pattern clustering approach is used for activity modeling. Ontology based activity modeling is preferred over other modeling techniques because of its unified modeling, representation and semantically clear reasoning. The experimental results show that the proposed EPAM framework of segmentation, pattern clustering and ontological modeling is efficient and more effective than the existing approach of activity modeling.",

abstract="Over the last few years, activity recognition in the smart home has become an active research area due to the wide range of human centric-applications. A list of machine learning algorithms is available for activity classification. Datasets collected in smart homes poses unique challenges to these methods for classification because of their high dimensionality, multi-class activities and various deployed sensors. In fact the nature of dataset plays considerable role in recognizing the activities accurately for a particular classifier. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of smart home datasets characteristics on state-of-the-art activity recognition techniques. We applied probabilistic and statistical methods such as the Artificial Neural network,  Hidden Markov Model, Conditional Random Field, and Support Vector Machines. The four real world datasets are selected from three most recent and publically available smart home projects. Our experimental results show that how the performance of activity classifiers are influenced by the dataset characteristics. The outcome of our study will be helpful for upcoming researchers to develop a better understanding about the smart home datasets characteristics in combination with classifier's performance.",

The challenge is to ensure an optimal quality of life and equitable treatment for the growing elderly population. Technological innovations present significant opportunities for meeting these challenges. However, there are also some potential risks associated with the application of technology in this domain. Starting from this apprehension, the paper deals with physical environments and needs of elderly in relation to technical implications and ethical considerations.

It considers the role of speculative practices as an aspect of design that allows HCI practitioners to explore problematics rather than problems. Problems need to be solved, whereas problematics are localities, situations, or experiences, where one can trace the connections between structural, political, and social forces and their implications to foster dialogue and reflection. As such, speculative design offers a theoretically rich approach through which to consider design implications of future and alternative conditions. Such work is discursively generative. To aid in deepening the philosophical aims of speculative design, I employ some of Gilbert Simondon's philosophical concepts, then examine several examples of recent speculative design.",

People who are more familiar with Internet technologies can take full advantage of the benefits brought by the new systems to everyday life, but, at the same time, if services are not carefully designed, they contribute to augment the digital gap between ``info-skilled'' users and people who are not acquainted with the new technologies. This paper provides an overview of interesting projects developed with the aim to favor social inclusion and to tear down barriers posed by digital technology, by supporting people with special needs (e.g., elderly and people with different impairments) in the fruition of e-services through easy forms of interactions. The study is restricted to solutions that envisage the TV device as the main user interface for supporting Ambient Assisted Living. From the survey, a basic set of services and interfaces, here described, appear to be fundamental for improving digital and social inclusion, but the design methodology for developing TV-based interfaces and services must be carefully chosen to reduce social marginalization.",

abstract="As per the statistics of World Health Organization, a major percentage of elderly society across the globe is affected with dementia (age related memory loss). Dementia care entails prolonged effort in terms of money, time and manpower. Assistive health care system is therefore essential and is probable through a smart home, that offers Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) to its occupants. The objective of this work is to model an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for dementia care through the smart home. The innovation in the design of IDSS is to offer two levels of decision-making (1) Short-Term Decision-Making (STDM)---to raise suitable alerts for the abnormality detected in ADL (2) Long-Term Decision-Making (LTDM)---to decide on the progress in occupant's developmental stage of dementia. The novelty in the design of STDM is to assimilate Random Forest (data driven) decision-making and Rule-based (knowledge-driven) decision-making within a single framework. Random Forest modeling provides better predictive accuracy through ensemble learning which is later combined with the domain specific knowledge to offer context-based decision-making. On the other hand, LTDM decides on occupants developmental stage of dementia through automation of Barthel score. Barthel score is a clinical measure to assess the stage of dementia through the level of dependency required by the occupant to complete his activities. The experimental analysis confirms the proficiency of the proposed IDSS in decision-making is better than existing approaches.",

abstract="An increasingly popular technique of monitoring activities within a smart environment involves the use of sensor technologies. With such an approach complex constructs of data are generated which subsequently require the use of activity recognition techniques to infer the underlying activity. The assignment of sensor data to one from a possible set of predefined activities can essentially be considered as a classification task. In this study, we propose the application of a cluster-based classifier ensemble method to the activity recognition problem, as an alternative to single classification models. Experimental evaluation has been conducted on publicly available sensor data collected over a period of 26 days from a single person apartment. Two types of sensor data representation have been considered, namely numeric and binary. The results show that the ensemble method performs with accuracies of 94.2{\%} and 97.5{\%} for numeric and binary data, respectively. These results outperformed a range of single classifiers.",

abstract="One of the more important demographic changes under way is the sharp decline in the rates of human fertility in all developed countries. Where such declines are not compensated by in-migration, as is the case in the United States, the result is the rapid aging of populations. Germany, which until recently was not prepared to dilute the ``Germanness'' of its population, has the world's oldest citizenry with a median age of 47 years. Such a population cannot remain economically or technologically dynamic. It also burdens the state as aging populations need to be looked after. This asymmetry in age profiles between developed and developing nations produces pressures for peoples' movements that are hard to resist in the modern world. That is the case especially when large segments of the population are faced with extreme distress. This has happened in the war-ravaged Syria where a civil war has lasted for almost five years, killed more than 250,000 people and rendered homeless half of the country's population. One million Syrians have reached the shores of Europe, with most of them heading towards Germany. While the administration headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel has been relatively accommodating, many of the German people have been less welcoming. The tensions caused by the arrival of such a large number of people have threatened the project to unify the many European nations into one economic and political entity.",

abstract="Typically, when analysing patterns of activity in a smart home environment, the daily patterns of activity are either ignored completely or summarised into a high-level ``hour-of-day'' feature that is then combined with sensor activities. However, when summarising the temporal nature of an activity into a coarse feature such as this, not only is information lost after discretisation, but also the strength of the periodicity of the action is ignored. We propose to model the temporal nature of activities using circular statistics, and in particular by performing Bayesian inference with Wrapped Normal {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}(WN){\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}WN{\}}{\$}{\$}Mixture {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}(WNM){\}}{\$}{\$}models. We firstly demonstrate the accuracy of inference on toy data using both Gibbs sampling and Expectation Propagation (EP), and then show the results of the inference on publicly available smart-home data. Such models can be useful for analysis or prediction in their own right, or can be readily combined with larger models incorporating multiple modalities of sensor activity.",

abstract="Over a third of the world's primary energy is consumed by buildings, smart planning of energy supply to buildings is important to conserve energy and protect the environment. Most energy-consuming domestic tasks can be performed within a time period rather than at specific times. Energy cost or emissions could be reduced if these flexible tasks can be scheduled co-ordinately among multiple homes. This chapter addresses the problem of energy management of smart homes with microgrid, where the operation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electricity-consumption household appliances are scheduled. A review of relevant literature works for smart homes with microgrid is presented. Then an optimisation-based framework is proposed to describe the related energy management problems of smart homes with microgrid. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for three different objectives is developed: total cost minimisation, fair cost distribution, and cost versus CO2 emissions. The application of this model is illustrated through an illustrative example of a smart building. The modelling approach developed in this work and the results obtained suggest that optimisation-based energy management of smart homes with microgrid results in cost saving and CO2 emissions reduction. Moreover, the optimal operation schedules of the DERs, including thermal/electrical storage, are discussed.",

It can provide a large variety of different methods and techniques for handling and analyzing temporal data generated by smart-home environments. Temporal data mining in general fits into a two level architecture, where initially a transformation technique reduces data dimensionality in the first level and indexing techniques provide efficient access to the data in the second level. This infrastructure of temporal data mining provides the basis for high-level data mining operations such as clustering, classification, rule discovery and prediction. These operations can form the basis for developing different smart-home applications, capable of addressing a number of situations occurring within this environment.

abstract="Smart home is regarded as an independent healthy living for elderly person and it demands active research in activity recognition. This paper proposes kernel fusion method, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to improve the accuracy of performed activities. Although, SVM is a powerful statistical technique, but still suffer from the expected level of accuracy due to complex feature space. Designing a new kernel function is difficult task, while common available kernel functions are not adequate for the activity recognition domain to achieve high accuracy. We introduce a method, to train the different SVMs independently over the standard kernel functions and fuse the individual results on the decision level to increase the confidence of each activity class. The proposed approach has been evaluated on ten different kinds of activities from CASAS smart home (Tulum 2009) real world dataset. We compare our SVM kernel fusion approach with the standard kernel functions and get overall accuracy of 91.41 {\%}.",

abstract="New research are being developed continuously seeking for technologies that improve life quality. Among the topics addressed in these studies, the development of technologies for the urban environment with a focus on sustainability presents itself as a relevant theme. Since the 1970s, concepts of intelligent cities have been discussed, highlighting strategies focused on physical, social, institutional and economic infrastructure in an innovative and sustainable way. This work aims to analyze the city of Curitiba, capital of the state of Paran{\'a} (Brazil), considered a model of an intelligent Brazilian city. The method used was the case study, focusing on strategies applied in the abovementioned city. A documentary review was also carried out based on the UN Habitat III discussions held in Quito (Ecuador), on sustainable urban development studies for the new agenda of 2030. Results show that Curitiba stands out mainly for its mobility, economic development and urban innovations, and demonstrate that technology helps to promote transparency and greater efficiency in services provision, mitigating resources use inefficiency and contributing to the environment and its population life quality. Finally, in the final considerations, it is stated that conscious addition of new technologies tends to increase efficiency of cities and contribute to a balanced development in the economic, social and environmental sectors.",

abstract="Older adults often have multiple chronic comorbidities and functional impairments, necessitating care models that address both medical and custodial care needs. The majority of older Americans prefer to avoid institutional care, creating a need for high-quality, cost-effective, community-based models of long-term care. Community-based care exists along a continuum ranging from care provided in the home to daytime-only care for individuals who continue to live in private homes to residential care options. Patients and their families can choose home-based care, adult day care, Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), independent living senior housing, assisted living, adult foster care, or continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), depending on how much assistance they need. Medicare and private health insurance have a limited role in financing long-term care, so most of these options are paid either out of pocket or by Medicaid. There is limited high-quality evidence that any one model is superior to another or to nursing home care with regard to quality of care, patient outcomes, or cost. Choosing a setting of care is an opportunity for shared decision-making. Primary care providers who have an understanding of the available options in their communities can help patients and their caregivers choose the most appropriate setting for long-term care.",

abstract="Vulnerability is about being at risk and it is often understood as the effect of limited physical or cognitive capabilities, such as age, frailty or illness. Vulnerable people are frequently excluded from the design of technologies that could in fact support them in tackling these risks. This paper explores designing with three vulnerable groups: children with special needs, chronically ill teenage patients, and isolated, or afraid of being so in the near future, elderly adults. We choose three distinct groups in order to show the breadth and variations in the ways in which people may be vulnerable. We looked at their digital lives and possible new risks and dependencies created by the use of digital technologies. Designing with vulnerable people is practically, methodologically, and ethically challenging. We show how methodological and reflexive sensibilities help to address these challenges and keep the design process on track.",

This estimated face movement information is used in the face tracker for tracking faces in video images. Our experimental result shows a conspicuous improvement in the performance of the face tracking process in terms of success rates and with robustness against interruptions from face-like blobs.",

Our method employs first a feature selection technique to extract relevant features for classification and reduce the dimensionality of the data. Then, the output of the feature selection is fed into a random forest classifier for classification. We recruited three groups of participants in our study: healthy older adults, older adults with mild cognitive impairment and older adults with Alzheimer's disease.

abstract="Coping with the consequences of the demographic change, industrialized countries have to adapt their health care systems to the increasing medical need of older persons despite the threatening shortage of physicians. In this context, telemedical services for communication between doctors and patients come into fore. However, it is unclear in how far users accept these new care concepts. Crucial for the success of telemedical services is the choice of the medium and its perceived appropriateness in different using situations. In this paper, an exploratory approach was undertaken to examine the users' acceptance of four electronic communication media (telephone, videophone, videoconference, interactive wall) in three different usage situations (additional service, urgency situation, exclusively telemedical consultation). 200 participants volunteered to take part. Findings show that the acceptance strongly depends on the specific situation and the type of communication media. User diversity, in contrast, did not show a major role for the acceptance of telemedical consultation.",

Vibration sensors are used in an absolute passive manner so the monitored persons do not have to wear any sensors. Furthermore this technology preserves the private sphere of monitored persons. In order to extract geometric gait features like motion trajectories out of the vibrational signals, the main part of this work focuses on methods for localization of seismic sources on the two-dimensional floor surface. Starting from a conventional TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) based technique using uniaxial acceleration sensors we show how to minimize installation cost by reducing the number of sensor entities via tri-axial sensor technology. We describe the main challenges of wave propagation in solids, namely dispersion and multipath propagation and discuss their implications on robustness and accuracy of localization results.

In our approach, providing solutions and technologies for elderly requires to consider the simplification of architectures and the acceptance of the user. We propose to provide content and services using familiar TV sets and to consider medical advices and recommendations in using media and TV programs. As the user control is a key criterion in adopting context-aware systems, we consider the user actions and preferences. The proposed media selection scheme considers the evolution of the user preferences based on the recent user behavior patterns.",

abstract="This paper proposes to use machine learning techniques with ultrasonic sensors to predict the behavior and status of a person when they live solely inside their house. The proposed system is tested on a single room. A grid of ultrasonic sensors is placed in the ceiling of a room to monitor the position and the status of a person (standing, sitting, lying down). The sensors readings are wirelessly communicated through a microcontroller to a cloud. An intelligent system will read the sensors values from the cloud and analyses them using machine learning algorithms to predict the person behavior and status and decide whether it is a normal situation or abnormal. If an abnormal situation is concluded, then an alert with be risen on a dashboard, where a care giver can take an immediate action. The proposed system managed to give results with accuracy exceeding 90{\%}. Results out of this project will help people with supported needed, for example elderly people, to live their life as independent as possible, without too much interference from the caregivers. This will also free the care givers and allows them to monitors more units at the same time.",

We propose a method for automatically selecting the most promising source spaces among a number of available spaces.

Instead of traditional interface methodologies such as keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or remote control, users in smart home or environment can control smart appliances via their hand gestures. This chapter presents a novel hand gesture interface system via a single depth imaging sensor to control smart appliances in smart home and environment. To control the appliances with hand gestures, our system recognizes the hand parts from depth hand silhouettes and generates control commands. In our methodology, we first create a database of synthetic hand depth silhouettes and their corresponding hand parts-labelled maps, and then train a random forests (RFs) classifier with the database. Via the trained RFs, our system recognizes the hand parts from depth silhouettes. Finally based on the information of the recognized hand parts, control commands are generated according to our predefined logics. With our interface system, users can control smart appliances which could be TV, radio, air conditioner, or robots with their hand gestures.",

In this work, we propose a novel machine learning approach for ADL recognitions by considering the location context information of the elder. With the popularity of smart phones, motion recognition can be done by the embedded sensors such as acceleration sensors and. However different ADL models possibly have the same movement to a certain degree, which will affect the classification performance. We append the location information as an additional feature to detect ADL. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to classify the ADL.

abstract="Activity and behaviour modelling are significant for activity recognition and personalized assistance, respectively, in smart home based assisted living. Ontology-based activity and behaviour modelling is able to leverage domain knowledge and heuristics to create Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and behaviour models with rich semantics. However, they suffer from incompleteness, inflexibility, and lack of adaptation. In this article, we propose a novel approach for learning and evolving activity and behaviour models. The approach uses predefined ``seed'' ADL ontologies to identify activities from sensor activation streams. Similarly, we provide predefined, but initially unpopulated behaviour ontologies to aid behaviour recognition. First, we develop algorithms that analyze logs of activity data to discover new activities as well as the conditions for evolving the seed ADL ontologies. Consequently, we provide an algorithm for learning and evolving behaviours (or life habits) from these logs. We illustrate our approach through scenarios. The first scenario shows how ADL models can be evolved to accommodate new ADL activities and peculiarities of individual smart home's inhabitants. The second scenario describes how, subsequent to ADL learning and evolution, behaviours can be learned and evolved.",

The Indian subcontinent has a particularly rich cultural heritage, which has a certain level of natural compatibility with the transhumanist core philosophies. From the pursuit of longevity to the morphological freedom exercised by the avatars of ancient polytheistic Gods and Goddesses, the legacy and heritage of ancient Indian civilizations have much more similitude with the radical concepts of transhumanism of the modern ages. Statistics show a significant possibility for India to emerge as one of the revered players in the field of economy, science, and technology by 2050. Such a promising scenario paves a way for ideas like transhumanism to play an important role in shaping the country's future. In addition, a wider acceptance of transhumanist concepts can be easily achieved in India by connecting the common Indian man to his roots, using layman's words instead of strictly academic terminologies.",

abstract="The shift to smart cities, and further to cognitive cities, should follow citizens' needs, and not only the efficient use of resources. Citizens wish to cooperate in decision-making (or voting) and to be informed about various developments in cities, preferably in comprehensible ways. But, summing up from a large amount of data and gamut of data types is not an easy task. Furthermore, many concepts and predicates are expressed by adjectives and adverbs. Hence, the option are linguistic summaries based on the fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic theory. Other stakeholders in cities (dispatchers, planners, marketers, local government, journalists) may also benefit from this approach. Linguistic summaries are able to verbalize mined information from the data by quantified sentences of natural language such as most of young citizens have rather negative opinion about topic T and most of foreign visits are from countries with medium GDP. Illustrative examples are focused on informing citizens, managing surveys, explaining development in pollution and traffic, analysing tourist activities. In this way, stakeholders are informed in a concise way about the situation and trends. They can also recognize the effects of regulations which had been brought in. Another benefit is that citizens are better prepared for voting. This contribution also emphasizes the fact that these achievements can be realized without collecting sensitive data from citizens using them as sensors (except volunteers, which prefer simpler data collection). Moreover, exchange of summaries is not as demanding as exchanging sensitive data.",

This increase has come as a result of rapid technological revolutions in engineering and telecommunication industries. The advancement in technology has enabled access of intelligent home networks locally as well as remotely. This in turn has led to poor quality of service (QoS) to the consumers of such services and applications. Therefore, in this chapter, we present performance optimization of intelligent home network model that is scalable and adaptable to these increases and technological changes. We segmented and prioritized the intelligent home network into six subnets. Then we assigned weighing factor numbers to the devices, which aided in their classification and prioritization. We then grouped the supported home network services and applications into six classes and increased the number of transmitted packets per iteration in each Class of Service (CoS). We tested and evaluated proposed model using OMNET++ simulator against Priority Queuing (PQ) and Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ) models.

abstract="The decrease in childbirth and the great increase in life expectancy represent typical demographic trends in industrialised countries. These tendencies make more concrete the issue regarding elderly people: the more they grow old, the more they are likely to need medical, social and personal care services. Nursing home care services are probably the most important example in terms of social costs, not only because they are extremely expensive from an economic point of view, but also because they determine a forced relocation of elderly people. To be compelled to live in a new place, completely depending on other people's assistance, has unquestionably a deep psychological impact (Hormuth, 1990): probably more difficult to assess than the economic expenditures, but definitely not less significant. Elderly people undoubtedly prefer living independently in a familiar domestic and residential setting. Anyway, a new series of problems arises, due to the shortage of residential infrastructures and facilities and the lack of home service workers compared to the large number of people who need assistance. As for domestic settings, in addition, the psychological impact of a long term home care assistance is still far from well understood: assistance provided by other people can generate a stronger negative influence upon final users, in that they may perceive a loss of control in their living space, and they may look at home service caregivers as privacy intruders. This condition may represent a menace to self-esteem and to the integrity of personal identity.",

abstract="Smart home technology became more and more widespread within recent years. They aim to make life easier and taking over unwanted tasks. In traditional homes, it is often not clear whether all windows and doors of a house are closed before inhabitants leave the home or go to sleep. However, this can be easily addressed by smart homes. We present a system based on opportunistically located ambient lights that assist inhabitants of a smart home in answering this question. In this paper, we show the concept of our system and the inhabitant-centered design process behind the development. The system was installed in a one-family smart home. We report on insights gained through data collected from this deployment over a period of six months. Within interviews, we found that the ambient light system gave inhabitants a more confident feeling about open doors/windows.",

The emerging pervasive technology has revolutionised the way of assistance in elderly care. Current solutions usually focus too much on technology, and fail to address the usability issues. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive system for both elderly care providers and elders. The system enables coordinators to manage care-givers and elders in an efficient way to improve service quality. For instance, care-givers can be scheduled in a real-time manner with mobile phones. We also deploy several sensors in their homes to monitor daily routines to ensure their safety. Alerts will be sent and accessible by coordinators immediately once detected, then elderly care services can be provided accordingly. We test our system in a real home for over 2 months. Finally, we offer a statistical study about the collected data and the reported alerts.",

abstract="This volume aims to stimulate new ideas for American public policy. It is based on the notion that ``learning'' is paramount to a country's long-term success. We believe that to be effective in the 21st century America must look beyond orthodoxy to learn from across countries and disciplines. As a result, American public policy must be examined through a multidisciplinary lens and learn from the different approaches of economists, political scientists, business leaders, medical professionals, government leaders, and diplomats, among others. By considering successful case studies of public administration and economic management around the world, American policymakers, academics, and the public at large will be able to think creatively about possible solutions to the challenges that the country faces. This international and multidisciplinary approach is needed to overcome America's ``resting-on-one's- laurels syndrome,'' in order to resist the inward-looking tendencies that come from decades of unquestioned world primacy, and redress what we see as a dangerous isolationism in American public policy and American society overall.",

abstract="In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.",

Ontology-based activity modelling is able to leverage domain knowledge and heuristics to create Activities of Daily Living (ADL) models with rich semantics. However, they suffer from incompleteness, inflexibility, and lack of adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning and evolving activity models. The approach uses predefined ''seed'' ADL ontologies to identify activities from sensor activation streams. We develop algorithms that analyze logs of activity data to discover new activities as well as the conditions for evolving the seed ADL ontologies. We illustrate our approach through a scenario that shows how ADL models can be evolved to accommodate new ADL activities and preferences of individual smart home's inhabitants.",

abstract="If artificial entities as autonomous robots will be sentient beings, will it be necessary to give robots and AI entities some legal capacity comparable with legal personhood in a society that will be interacting with robotics and AI appliances? Must they have an understanding of legal consequences of their actions? In this chapter, this question is considered by analyzing the future capacities and functions of robots and AI systems and the rights and duties of existing legal subjects, natural persons, and (artificial) legal persons such as corporations and states. The question is posed if AI will have a capacity to be sentient as natural persons and---maybe--- other living beings or will AI always be comparable with the subject in the Chinese room experiment? Therefore the relevance of free will, intelligence, and consciousness of natural persons to acquire legal personhood are analyzed and compared with other beings, animals, and future sentient AI entities. The hesitance to give legal personhood to AI is also influenced by the human conviction that this would increase the risk to lose control and a ``robot uprising.'' Man, as always, is afraid of technology getting out of hand and is convinced of their own superiority and therefore always wants to stay in control. Question is if there always has to be a natural person in the loop. In that light the need for a certain legal personhood in a future legal framework, considering civil liability and even criminal liability, is discussed as it is also subjected to considerations as proposed by a resolution of the European Parliament, eventually leading to proposals in European policy and law.",

The essential advantage of cloud computing derives from the ability to leverage IT to engage users and other actors in the creation of innovative value propositions and to reengineer existing ones. For IT organizations and enterprises, a transition to cloud-oriented services occurs when an application migrates to the cloud with minimal changes to its design and delivery continues to support current performance and security requirements. For a cloud-based service transformation, much more is required. IT objectives drive larger, comprehensive application changes. Transforming the IT organization to embrace cloud-based service innovation involves rethinking and redesigning the organization's approach to its customers.

The system devises pain management strategies based on the relevant standards and patients' data, and these strategies are identified, applied, and monitored by the system in real-time. A perpetual feedback loop is created among the system components and the outcomes are communicated to the stakeholders to enable reflections and continuous improvements in the pain management standards, strategies, and processes. The system architecture and its architectural components are described. A preliminary analysis is provided using handwritten and digital pain management related data.",

The study assessed the metropolitan region of Abuja in view to understand and identified the usual associated urban problems facing the region, and how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can serve as a key critical factor to the realization of smart metropolitan development in an effort to address the identified urban problems of the Abuja metropolitan region. For Abuja to achieve these goals, the use of ICT was found to be essential. Therefore, this study evaluated among others the roles and integration of ICT in the development of a Smart metropolitan Abuja region. The chapter recommends a realistic implementation of the multi-nuclei regional plan with appropriate transportation framework, stronger economic base and pro-poor land use strategies. This paradigm shift could occur if and only the Government of Nigeria exhibits robust political will in the regional development process.",

abstract="This work presents a multi-sensor platform integrating one or more commercial low-cost ambient sensors and one wearable device for the automatic assessment of the physical activity and sedentary time of an aged person. Each sensor node could operate in a stand-alone way or in a multi-sensor approach; in the last case, fuzzy logic data fusion techniques are implemented in a gateway in order to improve the robustness of the estimation of a physiological measure characterizing the level of physical activity and specific parameters for the quantification of a sedentary lifestyle. The automatic assessment was conducted through two main algorithmic steps: (1) recognition of well-defined set of human activities, detected by ambient and wearable sensor nodes, and (2) estimation of a physiological measure, that is (MET)-minutes. The overall accuracy for activity recognition, obtained using simultaneously ambient and wearable sensors data, is about 5{\%} higher of single sub-system and about 2{\%} higher of that obtained with more than one ambient sensor. The effectiveness of the platform is demonstrated by the relative error between IPAQ-SF score (used as ground-truth, in which a low score corresponds to a sedentary lifestyle whereas a high score refers to moderate-to-vigorous activity level) and average measured (MET)-minutes obtained by both sensor technologies (after data fusion step), which never exceeds 7{\%}, thus confirming the advantage of data fusion procedure for different aged people used for validation.",

Some examples of such applications include GPS applications on mobile devices, accelerometers, or location sensors designed to track human and vehicular traffic. Such data lends itself to a variety of rich applications in which one can use the sensor data in order to model the underlying relationships and interactions. This requires the development of trajectory mining techniques, which can mine the GPS data for interesting social patterns. It also leads to a number of challenges, since such data may often be private, and it is important to be able to perform the mining process without violating the privacy of the users. Given the open nature of the information contributed by users in social sensing applications, this also leads to issues of trust in making inferences from the underlying data.

abstract="Although older people are an important user group for smart environments, there has been relatively little work on adapting natural language interfaces to their requirements. In this paper, we focus on a particularly thorny problem: processing speech input from older users. Our experiments on the MATCH corpus show clearly that we need age-specific adaptation in order to recognize older users' speech reliably. Language models need to cover typical interaction patterns of older people, and acoustic models need to accommodate older voices. Further research is needed into intelligent adaptation techniques that will allow existing large, robust systems to be adapted with relatively small amounts of in-domain, age appropriate data. In addition, older users need to be supported with adequate strategies for handling speech recognition errors.",

abstract="Remote Control Systems (RCSs) are increasingly being installed in homes and offices. Technology evolves very rapidly and sensors and devices are becoming smaller, smarter and more powerful. Mobile and Web apps are commonly used to remotely configure and control devices. Home control is especially valuable for blind people, since they can benefit from technology to control and turn on/off devices autonomously. Remote control can offer meaningful support, especially when devices are not directly accessible (e.g., thermostat to manage heating temperature). Therefore, if RCS interfaces are not accessible via screen reader, blind users may miss a great opportunity to achieve greater autonomy at home. This paper investigates the accessibility of the web user interfaces offered by RCSs for blind people. To do this, the Fibaro, a popular Remote Control System, was tested as a case study by analyzing the interaction via screen reader. Results indicate that accessibility and especially usability need to be improved to make interaction easier and more satisfying for blind people. To this aim, some suggestions are offered to aid developers in designing more accessible RCS user interfaces.",

Furthermore, many caregivers live apart from the loved ones that they provide care to, and have responsibilities outside of caregiving including work and family. Use of technologies and services designed to make life easier for the general population can also be leveraged to reduce the burden and stress related with caregiving. In this study, 30 family caregivers were surveyed in depth to learn about their experiences with various technologies and services. Questions covered caregivers' use of technologies and services, perceived usefulness and ease of use, reasons for use and non-use, and ideas for new and improved tools. Many caregivers were currently using a technology or service for caregiving, but most of the technologies and services presented in the questionnaire were only used by a limited number of participants. While usage was limited, those that currently used technologies and services generally found them helpful for making caregiving duties easier. Responses showed that technologies and services were not being widely used mainly due to limited awareness and availability, and less because of lack of interest.",

abstract="Humans deeply modified their relationship to their housings during the past centuries. Once a shelter where humans could find protection and have rest, the living place successfully evolved to become the midpoint of the family, the expression of own culture and nowadays a more self centered place where individuals develop their own personal aspirations and express their social position. With the introduction of communication technologies, humans may become nomads again with the ability to stay connected with others in any place at any time but, as a paradox, we can observe a wide movement for ``cocooning''. Among all the services a living place can bring to inhabitants, we may list comfort, security, wellness and also health services. Thus a new living place is to be invented, becoming the ``witness'' of our breath, perceiving the inhabitants rhythms of activities, habits, tastes and wishes. Eventually, the ``smart home'' become the ``Health Smart Home'' to enable the follow up of physical and health status and meet the new concepts of ``Aging in place'' and ``citizen health care''. We listed some of the research projects in Health Smart Home, which were launched worldwide to discover they are mostly based on very basic sensors and simple algorithms. We experienced our own Health Smart Home to prove that temporal analysis of data output from simple presence sensors is already worthwhile. We first produced ``ambulatograms'', a temporal representation of the daily activity gathered from the presence sensors, and then discovered regular patterns of activities which we named ``circadian activity rhythms (car)'', the direct relationship between night and day level of activities and also the information contained in periods of inactivity. We now concentrate on the automatic recognition of the daily Activities with multiple sensor fusions methods.",

Engineers need to have good understanding of the human body and different sorts of diseases, before they can apply good engineering solutions to solve the medical problems. However, teaching engineering students without prior education in medical-related aspects could be challenging.

abstract="Sensor technologies are crucial in ambient assisted living system because they can observe, measure, and detect users' daily activities, in the meanwhile issue warnings when parameters exceed particular thresholds. Despite their enormous supporting potential, the quantities of data generated from multiple sensor is huge (i.e., big data), because they involved everywhere, such as smart home, health-based wearable devices, and assistive robots. Generally speaking, big data can be defined as large pools of data which comes from digital pictures, videos, intelligent sensors, posts to social media sites, purchase transaction records, cell phone global positioning system signals, to name a few. During the past few years, there is a great interest both in the commercial and in the research communities around big data. Under these circumstances, data mining, whose main purpose is to extract value from mountains of datasets, is drawing a lot of people's attention. To follow this trend, in this article, we intend to take an algorithmic point of view, i.e., applying intelligent algorithms to data, with an emphasis on the biology-based innovative computational intelligence (CI) methods. This work makes several contributions. First, it investigates a set of biology-based innovative CI algorithms which can enable a high throughput under extract from the insights of data. Second, it summarizes the core working principles of these algorithms systematically and highlights their preliminary applications in different areas of data mining. This will allow us to clearly pinpoint the intrinsic strengths of these novel algorithms, and also to define the potential further research directions. The findings of this chapter should provide useful insights into the current big data literature and be a good source for anyone who is interested in the application of CI approaches to big data and its corresponding fields.",

Assistive technology (AT) can potentially help the individuals gain functional autonomy and thereby decreasing the burden on family members and caregivers to provide assistance. AT can assist the individuals with accomplishing daily activities of living, mobility, environmental control (e.g. lock or unlock doors), communication (particularly for individuals with communication difficulties), education, employment, sport and recreation. However, despite the noted benefits of AT, lack of availability and accessibility of information and evaluation, costs, and limited training on how to use AT are reported to be the main reasons responsible for mitigating the use of AT. Efforts should be made to facilitate the use of appropriate forms of AT in order to improve the individual's functional independence, mobility, participation and quality of life.",

abstract="Ten years ago, researchers in multi-agent systems became more and more aware that agent systems consist of more than only agents. The series of workshops on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS 2004-2006) emerged from this awareness. One of the primary outcomes of this endeavor was a principled understanding that the agent environment should be considered as a primary design abstraction, equally important as the agents. A special issue in JAAMAS 2007 contributed a set of influential papers that define the role of agent environments, describe their engineering, and outline challenges in the field that have been the drivers for numerous follow up research efforts. The goal of this paper is to wrap up what has been achieved in the past 10 years and identify challenges for future research on agent environments. Instead of taking a broad perspective, we focus on three particularly relevant topics of modern software intensive systems: large scale, openness, and humans in the loop. For each topic, we reflect on the challenges outlined 10 years ago, present an example application that highlights the current trends, and from that outline challenges for the future. We conclude with a roadmap on how the different challenges could be tackled.",

Some of the reasons for undertaking Design for All are discussed, and, making use of the analogy of the printed book, the paper then shows how Design for All in combination with Information technologies are enablers in the widest sense of the term. Finally, it is noted that Design for All is a process, not a product, and while there are people who specialise in eAccessibility, the research agenda demands more involvement from information technologists of all kinds. These are issues that concern us all, in our roles as designers and implementers of information technology, as well as in our role as consumers of information and participants in the Information Society.",

abstract="Managing wandering behavior of people with dementia (PWD) has become increasingly imperative for these reasons: its high prevalence (60{\%}) among PWD, its negative outcomes such as falls or elopement, and its burden on caregivers. In this chapter, we discuss the emergence of sensors, techniques, and applications for managing wandering behavior of PWD. First, we briefly present the 5Ws1H (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW) conceptual map of wandering science including stakeholders (WHO), measurements of wandering (WHAT), environments in which wandering takes place (WHERE), detection of wandering (WHEN), causes of wandering (WHY), interventions of wandering (HOW). Second, we introduce a framework that identifies specific groups of mHealth and eHealth assistive technologies for managing dementia-related wandering. Third, we review existing technological works that address these 4 domains in the 5Ws1H conceptual map: WHAT-WHERE-WHY-HOW. In particular, we explore mHealth sensors to geo-fence and prevent elopement, mHealth devices to track and locate PWD who wander, information services to assist caregivers, eHealth tools to measure dimensions of dementia-related wandering, and mHealth tools that analyze proximal factors as well as study background factors. Based on this review, we further discuss research and design issues, human factors, ethics, security and privacy that need to be considered when implementing mHealth applications for wandering management. We conclude the chapter by highlighting the future research work in this area.",

abstract="In the 21st century, there has been an increase in the ageing population and people with disabilities in the majority of the world. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates suggest that the world total will be more than one billion people aged 60 or over by the year 2025 (Marshall et al., 2004). Thus, ageing population has been a growing concern in Turkey as in other countries. Especially in Turkey, where most Turks live in high-rise apartments, it is important to design housing universally. Turkish culture is based on a close relationship between the older people and their families. Today, rather than preferring specialised institutions, most of the older people want to live in their own houses, where they lived when they were younger. There is a crucial need for alternative daily living environments based on universal design that provides a higher level of accessibility, usability and adaptability for all users regardless of their size, age or ability. This study aims for a cultural understanding of the views of the Turkish older people on designing their homes for ageing in place. It is based on data from empirical research on universal design. The cultural differences between Turkey and places like the US, the UK and Europe, where most of the research in this area has been done, could provide fascinating insights.",

The digital tightrope---a balancing act between breakneck technological development on the one side, countered by unforeseen consequences that may promote or violate time-honoured rights on the other---represents a conundrum for humans, both as individuals and as a collective. This book has explored a series of challenges that require thoughtful reflection, the evaluation of one set of interests with respect to another, all within the framework of binding state obligations to protect vulnerable populations.

abstract="Modern medicine and health care in all parts of our world are facing formidable challenges: exploding costs, finite resources, aging population as well as deluge of big complex, high-dimensional data sets produced by modern biomedical science, which exceeds the absorptive capacity of human minds. Consequently, the question arises about whether and to what extent the advances of machine intelligence and computational power may be utilized to mitigate the consequences. After prevailing over humans in chess and popular game shows, it is postulated that the biomedical field will be the next domain in which smart computing systems will outperform their human counterparts. In this overview we examine this hypothesis by comparing data formats, data access and heuristic methods used by both humans and computer systems in the medical decision making process. We conclude that the medical reasoning process can be significantly enhanced using emerging smart computing technologies and so-called computational intelligence. However, as humans have access to a larger spectrum of data of higher complexity and continue to perform essential components of the reasoning process more efficiently, it would be unwise to sacrifice the whole human practice of medicine to the digital world; hence a major goal is to mutually exploit the best of the two worlds: We need computational intelligence to deal with big complex data, but we nevertheless -- and more than ever before -- need human intelligence to interpret abstracted data and information and creatively make decisions.",

In this paper, we use a robot music player; miuro, and we focus on the music selection for providing the comfortable sound field for the person. The experimental results show that the proposed method can learn the relationship between human interaction and its corresponding behavior, and that the proposed method can provide the person with the preferable song as the comfortable sound field.

abstract="For impaired people, the conduction of certain daily life activities is problematic due to motoric and cognitive handicaps. For that reason, assistive agents in ambient assisted environments provide services that aim at supporting elderly and impaired people. However, these agents act in complex stochastic and indeterministic environments where the concrete effects of a performed action are usually unknown at design time. Furthermore, they have to perform varying tasks according to the user's context and needs, wherefore an agent has to be flexible and able to recognize required capabilities in a certain situation in order to provide adequate, unobtrusive assistance. Hence, an expressive representation framework is required that relates user-specific impairments to required agent capabilities. This work presents an approach which (a) describes and links user impairments and capabilities using the formal, model-theoretic semantics expressed in OWL2 DL ontologies, (b) computes optimal policies through Reinforcement Learning and propagates these in an agent network. The presented approach improves the collaborative, personalized and adequate assistance of assistive agents and tailors the agent-based services to the user's missing capabilities.",

abstract="Sleep disorders are common in the elderly, can be distressing to both the elderly and their carers, and often contribute to institutionalisation when the disruptive night behaviour of the older person exerts its toll on the carer. The main way of determining Sleep Activity Pattern (SAP) and aberrant changes in the normal sleep/wake cycle is through verbal reports of the patient and his/her carer, information that can be subjective, incomplete and unreliable. An emerging modality for SAP monitoring is actigraphy, involving the use of wearable sensors commonly based on accelerometers. To bring actigraphy to the next level in order to reap its benefit for the elderly population at large, one must consider its deployment in realistic settings such as nursing homes and in the homes of the subjects. In this paper we provide a brief account of the trial deployment of our SAP monitoring system in a nursing home, where data was collected from fifteen elderly residents for a period of two weeks each. Besides providing an objective basis for obtaining sleep related information from patients who are often unable to remember clearly how well they have slept, our system benefits staff and doctors by providing more accurate information as a supplement to the sleep diary, and hopefully even eliminate the need for the latter. Preliminary results are reported herein.",

abstract="It is a well-known fact that exercising helps people improve their overall well-being; both physiological and psychological health. Regular moderate physical activity improves the risk of disease progression, improves the chances for successful rehabilitation, and lowers the levels of stress hormones. Physical fitness can be categorized in cardiovascular fitness, and muscular strength and endurance. A proper balance between aerobic activities and strength exercises are important to maximize the positive effects. This balance is not always easily obtained, so assistance tools are important. Hence, ambient assisted living (AAL) systems that support and motivate balanced training are desirable. This chapter presents methods to provide this, focusing on the methodologies and concepts implemented by the authors in the physical activity monitoring for aging people (PAMAP) platform. The chapter sets the stage for an architecture to provide personalized activity monitoring using a network of wearable sensors, mainly inertial measurement units (IMU). The main focus is then to describe how to do this in a personalizable way: (1) monitoring to provide an estimate of aerobic activities performed, for which a boosting based method to determine activity type, intensity, frequency, and duration is given; (2) supervise and coach strength activities.

abstract="This chapter, based on a mixed method research approach, offers insights into possibilities and limitations of using ICT measures for crowd management and distribution during urban mass events (UMEs). Based on literature, practical applications and analyses of research results, we propose crowd management should consider characteristics of both crowds and UMEs to increase information effectiveness. In relation to urban planning, results show that possibilities to influence a crowd's behavior depend on available (and known) choice sets offered in various locations, while distances towards locations across city centers appear less important. Limitations appear to be related to scarce knowledge on what drives crowd members to adapt or adhere to their activity choice behavior. Such insights are essential for smart cities striving for an optimal use of infrastructural capacity, as both the ambiguous effects of ICT measures, as well as a crowd's self-organizing capacity should be taken into account for delaying, solving and preventing disruptions of pedestrian flows in city centers.",

abstract="This chapter examines Italy as simultaneously a case of crisis of democracy, innovation and efficiency, to understand how a major Western economy turned into an economic laggard in only three decades and how to reverse the trend. The analysis interrogates Italy also as a laboratory of the decline of the West and of the European Union (EU), with its increasing inequality, decreasing social mobility and lack of innovation. The chapter analyses Italy in the years after World War II, when it emerged from the devastations of two decades of Fascist dictatorship, produced the ``Italian economic miracle'' of the reconstruction and the ``industrial district'' model, consolidated its democratic institutions and anchored itself into the Western sphere of international relations. Until the 1990s, with the collapse of Italy's party system, the accentuated personalization of politics and a growing split within the electorate, shaking Italy's institutional structure and putting a break on growth that started a trend of loss of human capital fleeing abroad. Multiple top-down attempts at reforms have failed to aggregate and incorporate knowledge holders' inputs, while currently populist movements even question innovation-driven changes. The chapter empirically shows how a twenty-first-century ``renaissance'' reversing these trends is likely to be based on innovation-driven change originating from the grass roots, Italy's networks of model cities, unions of municipalities and town associations. In closing, the chapter argues that to succeed such strategy prospect needs to be framed by national and EU policies.",

abstract="The world is urbanizing rapidly. In 1950 the urban population stood at 751 million. In 2018, it was 4.2 billion---55{\%} of the world's population. The Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs predicts that by 2050, 2.5 billion people will have been added to the urban population, for a total of 6.7 billion, representing 68{\%} of the world population. Sustainable development depends increasingly on the successful management of this urban growth (World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision [Key Facts], 2018). A complicating factor is that urban structure is inelastic. Transport corridors, property lines, and buildings are all long-lived objects. Urban development decisions made today will be felt for decades. Lean thinking and lean production constitute a direction in thinking about production. Lean is a focus on value as defined by the customer, not the producer. Lean focuses on reducing waste, rather than maximizing utilization of labor capital. Lean organization is oriented towards shop-floor continuous improvement, rather than radical and risky global redesigns. Both objectives of better value for the new city-dwellers, and reduced waste, seem well suited to the application of lean to the city. The city is an urban form which produces value for the citizens who live there. Central planning in which citizens are managed by experts are sometimes unpopular, and plans are regularly overridden by politics. Funds are never available to meet demand, and therefore wasted funds are a lost opportunity. Cities are being continuously rebuilt and remodeled. But lean is as yet under applied to the production of cities. Applying lean production and management can help move cities past apparently intractable problems due to 19th century central planning and mass production. Lean offers the potential to enable citizens and city managers to direct their energies in more valuable and low-waste directions. This paper explores how lean provides new perspectives by applying each of its five principles to management of city growth and operations.",

Virtualization Virtualizationof health care will improve the delivery of care through patient empowerment, but patients cannot be empowered if they do not have the required capacity (i.e. knowledge, abilities and supporting mechanisms).

Capacity building Capacity buildingis ``means by which skills, experience, technical and management capacity are developed within an organisational structure (contractors, consultants or contracting agencies)---often through the provision of technical assistance, short/long-term training, and specialist inputs (e.g., computer systems).

Capacity building, on the one hand, can be a means to develop a set of relevant capacities to adopt new virtualised health care technologies in order to improve health outcomes. On the other hand, virtualization of health care can enable capacity building. Digital health care technologiesDigital health care technologiescan be used to build up the capacity of patients by increasing their knowledge and skills and help them become active partners in their own health care. In order to entice users to adopt the new health care technology, it is important to address and fulfil their psychological, cultural and interpersonal needs. Psychological models can be used to influence the design and development of health care technologies for Health 4.0Health 4.0which in turn serve to encourage acceptance and uptake the new digital health Digital healthcare technologies, support individuals in reaching engaging experiences with the new technologies, promoting behavioral change and improving health outcomes.",

abstract="Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing global disease which highly affects the individual patient and represents a global health burden with financial impact on national health care systems. Type 1 DM can only be treated with insulin, whereas for patients with type 2 DM a wide range of therapeutic options are available. These options include lifestyle changes such as change of diet and an increase of physical activity, but also administration of oral or injectable antidiabetic drugs. The diabetes therapy, especially with insulin, is complex. Therapy decisions include various medical and life-style related information. Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) aim to improve the treatment process in patient's self-management but also in institutional care. Therefore, the personalization of the patient's diabetes treatment is possible at different levels. It can provide medication support and therapy control, which aid to correctly estimate the personal medication requirements and improves the adherence to therapy goals. It also supports long-term disease management, aiming to develop a personalization of care according to the patient's risk stratification. Personalization of therapy is also facilitated by using new therapy aids like food and activity recognition systems, lifestyle support tools and pattern recognition for insulin therapy optimization. In this work we cover relevant parameters to personalize diabetes therapy, how CDSS can support the therapy process and the role of machine learning in this context. Moreover, we identify open problems and challenges for the personalization of diabetes therapy with focus on decision support systems and machine learning technology.",

With online social networks, we wish to involve the elderly in new types of interactions, more various and frequent. They will be more active and included in micro-conversations around multimedia contents. The retirement homes will benefit also from social networking capabilities. They will participate to the local news dedicated to the elderly people. In addition, the remote family will be informed of activities through an agenda and various publications.",

abstract="As the world's population ages, the number of elderly people suffering from various diseases increases. Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. Advances in ubiquitous computing and wireless sensor networking have opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems. In-home pervasive networks may assist residents by providing memory enhancement, remote control of home appliances, medical data lookup and emergency communication. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents Home Healthcare Network (H2N), a complete system integrating the abundance of existing sensor nodes and other devices with pervasive, wireless networks. Our approach focuses on improving social aspects of elderly care besides the conventional care-giving functionalities. Finally, we talk about the importance of preserving privacy of such a system and propose a primitive solution for the inclusion of privacy awareness in the system. Although H2N is basically designed to function as a healthcare aide for the elderly people, with little customization it can be used to accommodate other user groups as well.",

abstract="Anomaly detection is a crucial issue for people with dementia and their families to live a safe and comfortable life at home. The elderly monitoring system is a promising solution. However, the conventional systems have limitations in detectable anomalies and support actions, which cannot fully cover individual needs. To achieve more person-centered home care for people with dementia, our research group has been studying environmental sensing with IoT. In this paper, using the environmental sensing, we propose a new service that allows individual users to customize definition of anomaly and corresponding actions. Specifically, borrowing a mechanism of context-aware services, we regard every anomaly observed within the house as a context. We then define every care as an action bound to an anomaly context. This achieves the personalized anomaly detection and care. To demonstrate the feasibility, we implement a prototype system and conduct a practical case study.",

Basically there is a demand and supply mismatch.

The elderly care industry, a new industrial form, emerges and is under constant improvement. Since the elderly care industry is marked by huge investment and long return cycle that requires strong supports of the financial sector, finance for the elderly care industry is thus developed. In recent years, under the joint efforts of the government and the market, finance for the elderly care industry in China has seen a series of achievements and is gradually moving toward industrialization and marketization. However, at present, China's elderly care industry is still young and facing a series of challenges such as the implementation of macro-policies and the rigid financing channels for enterprises. With the increasing ageing population, the demand for elderly care industry will grow exponentially. It can be predicted that with the joint efforts of the government and the market, there will be tremendous room for the development of elderly care industry financing.",

As long as the role of a state is embraced, the Tetris principle is introduced to systemise how a state designs and implements its policy framework to maximise socio-economic benefits while dealing with those future uncertainties. In particular, the policy directions on how to transform such uncertainties into opportunities are proposed on the basis of the Tetris principle, which considers a convergence between innovation, policymaking capacity, fairness and justice, human capital for convergence, and an ageing society.",

In previous research, we outlined five action areas to enhance Last Mile Mobility for older adults and persons with disabilities. Following up, we expand our view towards a wider Smart City context, reflecting on needs of other target audiences of urban and suburban transport systems. By analyzing the effects of an enhanced Last Mile Mobility on children, adolescents and marginalized persons, we conclude to review the transport ecosystem as a whole. Based on this holistic view, we elaborate further on previously identified action areas, focusing first on the three action areas, which describe a transport system's service quality: spread of service areas, accessibility of provided services, and availability of demand-driven services. We continue to deepen our view on the potential role of paratransit services within the urban transport ecosystem (action area 4), and finally delve into policy needs and recommendations to maximize Last Mile mobility in Smart Cities (action area 5). We conclude our work with a suggestion for future pilot implementation based on our findings.",

abstract="More and more efforts have been made to assist interdependent people in aging society today, particularly to the elderly living alone at home. This paper proposes an activity recognition system based on detection of acoustic events caused by residents within the living space. In the data collection process, an activity sound recording system with auto gain controlled and linearly amplified capability is equipped in a ward-like environment. The microphones are installed along the path from bedroom to lavatory. An activity sound database containing 105 designed scenarios is simulated and transcript in terms of 21 acoustic events such as footfall, fall down, and calling for help to form the acoustic event database. 21 Hidden Markov models (HMM) corresponding to acoustic events are trained by the acoustic event database. A keyword spotting recognition technology is adopted to recognize acoustic events and its ordered sequences for modeling activities. Acoustic features are computed by 39-dimensional mel-scaled frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with their first and second derivatives. The preliminary results show the average recognition rate of acoustic events is 91{\%} for inside testing and 72{\%} for outside testing respectively. The proposed approach shows an encouraging potential on the demand of modeling the regular living patterns of every variety.",

The baby signs can be applied not only to communicate with others but also to interact with a computer for people with low level of proficiency in conventional peripherals. To achieve this purpose, we have attempted to create a real application working under illumination change and real-time requirement. The system observes the user's sign by a monitor-mounted camera and color gloves.

Possible causes of uncertainties include changes in the operational environment, dynamics in the availability of resources, and variations of user goals. The aim of self-adaptation is to let the system collect additional data about the uncertainties during operation. The system uses the additional data to resolve uncertainties, to reason about itself, and based on its goals to reconfigure or adjust itself to satisfy the changing conditions, or if necessary to degrade gracefully. In this chapter, we provide a particular perspective on the evolution of the field of self-adaptation in six waves. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current knowledge in the field. From the presented perspective on the field, we outline a number of challenges for future research in self-adaptation, both in a short and long term.",

abstract="Advances in networking and small sensors (motes, RFID tags, etc) have made it possible to monitor and provide medical assistance to people in need at their homes. Recently, WISP tags, one advanced technology of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, have been used to monitor indoor activity, vital signs, sleep quality, and health status remotely. These types of systems take collaborative decision based on the data collected from all the WISP tags of the system. Any missing tag data within the environment may introduce critical error in the system's decision and this eventually may jeopardize system's decision reliability. In order to maintain system's reliability, a monitoring protocol needs to be executed frequently and it should be made efficient in terms of execution time. This paper studies the problem of monitoring a large set of WISP tags and identifying the missing ones. In this paper, based on probabilistic methods, we propose a monitoring protocol for WISP based Smart Healthcare Monitoring Systems. The goal of this protocol is to improve the security and reliability of a smart healthcare monitoring system by detecting missing tags and reporting back only the data of the existing tags.",

A questionnaire survey involving 277 valid responses was conducted. This study examined that both pleasure expectancy and the four influencing constructs in UTAUT showed significantly positive effects on user adoption of social robots.

We find the personal reflection is accompanied throughout the data collection process, which we called Human Algorithm, a cultural critical reflective evaluation mechanism to the data collection purpose, data collection tools and methods, and relation between data agents and community member. We argue that human algorithm would be helpful to improve crowdsourcing data in quality and collecting speed in community crowdsourcing studies.

Most research in this area relies on single cases with a specific AAL application and a limited number of users. To fill this gap, a content analyses of 35 AAL reports was conducted. The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of potential incentives for using AAL technologies. The data was coded using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). In total 13 incentives could be identified, which were grouped into six categories: (1) social incentives, (2) health and safety incentives, (3) activity incentives, (4) novel sensory incentives, (5) status incentives and (6) self-reactive incentives. Within these categories `social connectedness' and `health and safety' were the most important incentives. These results provide a comprehensive and theoretically grounded understanding of what motivates older adults to adopt AAL technologies.",

The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of `ambient assisted living' as an instantiation of the concept of `intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the idea of `ambient assisted living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.",

abstract="This paper confronts commonly-made assumptions about older adults and their general levels of capability when interacting with technology by reporting from an evaluation involving 49 older adults (M = 81 years) where performance was studied during task solving on a touch-based interface. The tasks involved were derived from a set of corresponding psychomotor abilities that are commonly involved in interaction mechanisms associated with touchscreen devices: precision, steadiness, dexterity, speed, and coordination. The evaluation consisted of measuring the performance of participants as well as having them assessing their own performance. To provide empirical results on why it is argued that it can be dangerous to assume anything about the capabilities of older adults, multiple analyses of the gathered data were used to highlight individual, group-related, and general patterns. Important relations, levels of variance, and statistically significant effects are highlighted as the paper argues for how these particular results do not align with common assumptions. The discussion draws on both the empirical results as well as related research to advocate why designers should acknowledge individual capabilities to ensure maximized performance when designing enabling technology for older adults.",

In this paper, leveraging the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) and multi-antenna setting in commodity WiFi devices, we design and implement a real-time, non-intrusive, and low-cost indoor fall detector, called Anti-Fall. For the first time, the CSI phase difference over two antennas is identified as the salient feature to reliably segment the fall and fall-like activities, both phase and amplitude information of CSI is then exploited to accurately separate the fall from other fall-like activities. Experimental results in two indoor scenarios demonstrate that Anti-Fall consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall, with 10{\%} higher detection rate and 10{\%} less false alarm rate on average.",

abstract="A rapidly growing elder population is placing unprecedented demands on health care systems around the world. Cognitive decline is one of the most taxing health problems in terms of both its relation to elders' overall functioning and the cost of care. The needs of elders with cognitive decline -- for invisible, intuitive support and assessment -- invite a reconsideration of the assumptions behind and specifications for ubiquitous computing solutions. This paper describes findings and implications of ethnographic research conducted with cognitively impaired individuals and their informal care networks in 45 households in 5 U.S. regions. Key themes regarding needs and barriers to successful aging are addressed through a set of design principles which apply across the stages of cognitive decline. To convey stage-specific findings and associated challenges for ubiquitous computing, case studies of four representative households and example concept solutions are presented. The design principles and technology challenges outlined in this paper may generalize to other contexts for ubiquitous computing.",

abstract="Being physically active is perhaps the most important factor influencing the health of elderly people. As a consequence, technologies that support and encourage physical activity have been developed. In this paper, we study a ``smart gym'' in a residential care building. Our findings indicate that the ``smart gym'' does not address the complexities of exercise for an elderly person: in order to exercise one has to master the gym equipment and its technology, cognitively as well as bodily. Both the equipment and the smart technology turn out to be difficult to master by its elderly users. Our study reports these difficulties and suggests a more nuanced concept of mastery as a way to address the challenges in designing for elderly users. We unfold physical and bodily dimensions of mastery and consider how these differ between individuals, and within the context and situation.",

One category of places that encounters economic challenges is islands, because they face higher costs and have long served on the periphery of the economy. One example of community and non profit action used for social and economic change is Fogo Island, a small island located off the coast of Newfoundland, with a unique approach to local development led by the Shorefast Foundation. Fogo Island is an excellent example of innovative policy, community action, and sustainable practice that informs planning for islands in general. Using a tourism and culture based model that features sustainability and heritage preservation, Fogo Island serves as a valuable example of ways to harness community assets and motivation for regional development.",

abstract="Existing activity recognition based assistive living solutions have adopted a relatively rigid approach to modelling activities. To address the deficiencies of such approaches, a goal-oriented solution has been proposed that will offer a method of flexibly modelling activities. This approach does, however, have a disadvantage in that the performance of goals may vary hence requiring differing video clips to be associated with these variations. In order to address this shortcoming, the use of rich metadata to facilitate automatic sequencing and matching of appropriate video clips is necessary. This paper introduces a mechanism of automatically generating rich metadata which details the actions depicted in video files to facilitate matching and sequencing. This mechanism was evaluated with 14 video files, producing annotations with a high degree of accuracy.",

The two African countries that were selected for this analysis are Cameroon and the island of Mauritius. The mostly positive impact of China on the organic growth in Mauritius, as illustrated in this chapter, defies the opinions of many authors who suggest that Chinese interests in Africa are solely focused on the exploitation of the continent's energy and mineral resources---Mauritius has no such resources to offer. For the Mauritian government, China is seen as a business partner which can provide the much needed financial capital and support for the development of the social and production capacity of the country. China has also played a key role in Cameroon's economic development, particularly with regard to the development of infrastructure. Weak and corrupt governance, however, continues to hamper Cameroon's development and obstructs the effective growth as well as the distribution of wealth to the population. Cameroon's economy, although relatively diversified with services, is still dominated by the public sector limiting its potential for future organic growth.",

Unfortunately, most people suffering from sleep disorders remain without diagnosis and treatment since the current sleep assessment systems are cumbersome and expensive. As a result, there is an increasing demand for cheaper and more affordable sleep monitoring systems in real-life environments. In this paper, we propose a novel non-intrusive system for sleep quality monitoring using a microbend fiber optic mat placed under the bed mattress. The sleep quality is assessed based on different parameters. Moreover, the sensor has been integrated into an existing Ambient Assisted Living framework to be validated in real scenarios. Three senior female residents participated in our study and the sleep data was collected over a one-month period in a home-living situation. The proposed system shows accurate and consistent results with a survey collected from each participant showing their sleep patterns and other in-home activities.",

Thus, we may say that environmental control systems enable anyone to operate a wide range of domestic appliances and other vital functions in the home by remote control.

abstract="This paper provides an overview of current research and open problems in sensor-based mobility analysis. It is focused on geriatric assessment tests and the idea to provide easier and more objective results by using sensor technologies. A lot of research has been done in the field of measuring personal movement/mobility by technical approaches but there are few developments to measure a complete geriatric assessment test. Such automated tests can very likely offer more accurate, reliable and objective results than currently used methods. Additionally, those tests may reduce costs in public health systems as well as set standards for comparability of the tests. New sensor technologies and initiatives for data standardization in health processes offer increased possibilities in system development. This paper will highlight some open problems that still exist to bring automated mobility assessment tests into pervasive clinical and domestic use.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) platforms are seen as a viable way for managing healthcare costs in an ever aging first world population. One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost ``off-the-shelf'' technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial ``observations from the field'' taken during the USEFIL AAL platform's integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

abstract="Continuous monitoring of safety and health conditions are among the primary goals of Ambient Assisted Living technologies. Effective solutions, aimed at fostering independent life of elderly persons, need for carefully balancing system intrusiveness, perspicacity, reliability and cost features. Heterogeneous networks, including different combination of environmental and personal (wearable) sensors can be used, with relevant value coming from data fusion: analysis techniques, aiming at inferring safety and health-related information in an indirect fashion from behavioral features are being deeply investigated with this aim. Device cooperation and interoperability are thus key factors: in this paper, the development of a wearable sensor suitable for broad range AAL application is introduced, addressing features specifically oriented to behavioral analysis. First, the device itself is capable of analyzing different features of the user motion patterns, synthesizing high-level information (simple task identification, energy expenditure) on board. This result in better battery management (less data transferred over the radio link) and interoperability (thanks to data abstraction). Second, by means of a suitable operating protocol, it cooperates with environmental sensors (e.g., a toilet sensor) providing the latters with user identification information, and thus allowing to exploit related data even in a multi-user context. This avoid the need of more expensive and complex indoor localization techniques or of more intrusive identification technologies (e.g., NFC/RFID tags).",

While a high degree of acceptance regarding AAL was found in the present study, the research also discovered that such technologies have the potential to profoundly affect, both positively and negatively, participants meaning and experience of the home environment. These findings suggest that research and development paradigms need to be expanded if our intention is to produce a product that will be accepted and helpful to the end-user.",

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies are on the rise in an attempt to ensure the sustainability of elderly care. Informal caregivers are an important stakeholder group for the successful adoption of AAL technologies. However, the number of studies that specifically address the attitudes, concerns and needs of this group is limited. With the aim to engage this underrepresented user group and to highlight their opinion and needs, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 informal caregivers to evaluate different AAL solutions in the field of mobility and safety. While informal caregivers recognized the safety and mobility benefits and the increased peace of mind -- privacy issues, the lack of human touch and an unfelt need for support formed major barriers towards adoption. Informal caregivers have an important influence on care decisions and should be closely involved when developing AAL tools.",

abstract="The vision of smart living promises innovative services from providers in energy, healthcare, entertainment and surveillance sectors. While smart homes used to equal home automation, evolving ICT technologies now enable truly adaptive and intelligent services that are integrated in several industries. Sector-specific service platforms are emerging that provide basic intelligence for services. However, smart living services should not be constrained to a specific industry sector, and hence the service platforms should be easily accessible for service providers regardless of their industry. In addition, smart living services should not be constrained to residents within the home, but should take advantage of outdoors position information to open up a range of novel service concepts. Establishing such a vision of smart living involves various technological and organizational challenges. This paper gives an overview of the current service platforms for smart homes and positioning information. Based on this overview, we propose a research agenda for enabling smart living services. The two major issues are how to achieve collective action between players from multiple sectors in order to set up a common service platform, and how to design business models that allow adding GNSS-based positioning information to the service platform.",

Traditional user research methods have many drawbacks, such as data interference, fuzzy feedback, single-dimensional indicators lack mutual verification, these issues have not been effectively resolved. If the designer can't understand the users' needs in time and objectively, and accurately construct the users' mental model, it will make the design decision blurred and slow, and the design scheme lacks the utility. Taking into account the drawbacks of traditional user research methods, we use the multidimensional data collaborative analysis technology to obtain user, environment, tasks and other context information. The interaction between the user and the product service system is selected, and the context data of the target user is acquired by using the wearable device, the eye movement measurement and behavior analysis system. These methods can assist the designer discover the product service system usability problem, understand the users' needs, build the users' mental model. This paper focuses on the research of user mental model acquisition mechanism in Product Service System Innovation Process. Based on context awareness multidimensional data collaborative analysis, the users' mental model is constructed accurately. To promote the effective matching between the design conceptual model and the user mental model to produce the optimal design, avoid the waste of the design process resources.",

For a system to perform human activity recognition in a real-world environment, multiple requirements exist, such as scalability, robustness, ability to deal with uncertainty (e.g., missing sensor data), to operate with multi-occupants and to take into account their privacy and security. This paper attempts to address the requirements of scalability and robustness, by describing a reasoning mechanism based on modular spatial and/or temporal context models as a network of ontologies.

This reframing of ageing and the ageing population offers new insights to CSCW and suggests new goals to support when designing technology for older people---goals that are more cognizant of people's agency and their desires to manage their evolving experiences of the ageing process.

This is achieved through the use of a ubiquitous computing system composed of off-the-shelf consumer electronic technologies. The Environmental Rating Scale (ERS), designed to assess residential interventions for people living with autism, guided the development and evaluation of CARE/ERS heuristics and interaction scenarios. The contributions of this investigation, advanced through an iterative design process involving expert reviewers, caregivers, and end-users in a patient centered approach for the design of actualizing e-health interventions, can be readily applied to a broad range of residential circumstances that improve quality of life.",

To cope with the limitations, we propose a system that captures activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, based on speech dialogue triggered by environment changes. Specifically, we deploy Autonomous Sensor Boxes, developed in our previous study, within a house of the elderly. The boxes gather and send house environmental data to the cloud. Then, the Change Finder algorithm is applied to the time-series data, to detect changes in the house online. On detecting a change, the Virtual Agent (VA) in the house asks the elderly what he/she is doing now. The elderly speaks to the VA, by which an ADL is recorded in the system. The proposed system can capture ADL with non-invasive sensing and create an opportunity for communication.",

abstract="Older people with dementia often depend on caregivers to manage their medications. The complexity of medication regimens in this population can impede medication adherence (i.e., taking medications as prescribed), which may compromise the effectiveness of treatment and increase the cost and burden of illness. Different technological devices have been used to improve medication adherence, however, these devices are often not evidence-based or designed with end-user involvement, thereby affecting their acceptability by people living with dementia and their caregivers. This in turn, can influence the effectiveness and uptake of such devices. This study aims to explore the challenges of medication adherence for both older people with dementia and their caregivers to guide the development of future technological solutions that can be effective, practical and sustainable.",

abstract="Technology acceptance of conventional Information and Communication technologies (ICT) devices is extensively researched within the last twenty years. However, comparably small knowledge is prevalent with respect to ubiquitous ICT in the living environment. Furthermore, there is nearly no data about user acceptance's dependency of integrated technologies on varying domestic spaces and how acceptance varies regarding user diversity. This study explores the acceptance of home-integrated ICT (hands-free equipment, camera, positioning system). In different domestic spaces (living room, bedroom, bathroom) acceptance for integrated technology was assessed, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods. Results show that users' acceptance differs considerably depending on the room type (acceptance is the highest in the living and the lowest in the bathroom). Moreover, the most disliked technology for home monitoring are camera-based systems, followed by the positioning system and the microphone. Also, there was a significant interacting effect of room type and technology: While none of these technologies is accepted for the bathroom, the living room is less sensitive to their presence with the microphone as the most accepted technology. User diversity does not play a major role hinting at generic acceptance patterns regarding ICT integrated in home environments.",

Most of this demographic change will take place in Asia and Africa as countries focus on economic growth through industrial development and employment opportunities that industry and its service businesses (suppliers) create for citizens. Because of jobs open in construction for industrial development, (e.g. infrastructure), in industries as they go into production, presumed access to education for children, and better health care, workers flocked to and are still flocking to urban centers. Unfortunately many growing cities, and mega-cities that grew from them, did not adequately plan on providing quality shelter for workers serviced by basic requirements as discussed earlier in this text. These include safe water, access to adequate sanitation, electricity, gas, and efficient transportation to move workers (if they are employed) to their jobs and back to their homes. Nor did all municipalities do thorough environmental impact studies. For example, one devastating result is that there has been air pollution from gases, aerosols, and fine size particles,

abstract="Ageing is a global challenge. As health conditions gradually deteriorate, elders are prone to suffering from multiple chronic diseases. The impact of ageing on the heath system is therefore unprecedented. Primary and preventive care is important to ensure older adults to receive immediate healthcare so that their health problems can be handled and alleviated in a timely manner, thus reducing the risk of development into serious illnesses. However, degradation of mobility in elderly becomes a hurdle to the access of healthcare services. In the paper, we present an outreach community healthcare model via a mobile clinic, which provides health assessment, interventions and health education to community-dwelling elderly. A key highlight of the mobile healthcare model is the adoption of healthcare information system (HIS) to streamline the operations and to enable smooth service delivery even with tight human resource. The role of information technology, the resulting benefits and outcomes are discussed in the paper. The HIS-leveraged mobile healthcare model is highly praised by the community and serves as an exemplar for establishing mobile clinics for various healthcare services.",

We construct large scale Chinese health lexicons based on expert knowledge and the Web resources; develop a feature extraction approach that draws out character, part-of-speech, and lexical features from QA data; and improve the performance of answer entity extraction by leveraging equivalence conjunctions (punctuation marks and conjunctional words) in Chinese to capture dependencies between tags of entities. Experiments on question and answer entity extraction demonstrate that the Precision, Recall and F-1 score are improved using our proposed features, and the Precision and F-1 score can be further improved by considering equivalence conjunctions.",

Ubiquitous healthcare data provides a mine of hidden knowledge which can be exploited in preventive care and ``wellness'' recommendations. Data mining is therefore a significant aspect of such systems. Distributed Data mining (DDM) techniques for knowledge discovery from databases help in the thorough analysis of data collected from healthcare facilities enabling efficient decision-making and strategic planning. This paper presents and discusses the development of a prototype ubiquitous healthcare system. The prospects for integrating data mining into this framework are studied using a distributed data mining system. The DDM system employs a mixture modelling mechanism for data partitioning.

Finally, the tele-monitoring of daily activity, called actimetric monitoring, allows the detection of abnormal repetitive tasks, and contributes also to the content of a custom folder of health data, which can provide a therapeutic education adapted to the person followed at home.",

The impact of the housing decisions the current older population and the baby boomers make will be felt across housing markets and the communities in which we live. How much and to what extent the housing and locational choices of the baby boomer generation will differ from preceding cohorts is yet to be established but overall they have greater means and opportunities to shape the lives they want to lead, the homes, places and communities in which they wish to live. This chapter provides an insight into the current housing circumstances of the older population, the influences on the direction of future housing and locational choices, and the need to move towards, and plan for, age-friendly communities if we are to optimise the ability of older people to actively age. The changes that are needed with regard to the provision of housing and the planning of communities will challenge policy makers across a number of policy arenas and at all levels of government. It will also require the collective foresight of the community in general to value ageing and the functionality, both physically and socially, of the locations and communities in which we live.",

Oswald and his colleagues seek to contribute to this literature by making a distinction between two characterisations of home. The first is home defined objectively in terms of agency. In essence, the concern here is with the observable functional use of the residential environment as manifest in constructs such as environmental press/docility, environmental richness/proactivity and person -- environment fit---``. ‥ the full range of objective behaviors''. The second is home defined subjectively in terms of the experience of belonging. It embraces ``. ‥ the full range of subjective experiences''. Under this rubric, home as belonging is manifest in residential satisfaction, place attachment and meaning. The fundamental separation of the two perspectives stems from a pervasive Janus-like confounding tension in the manner in which we view the phenomenon. What Oswald and his colleagues present as an agency perspective focuses on looking at the phenomenon of human habitation of dwellings from a logical empiricist analytical perspective. In contrast, a belonging perspective on home involves an empathic gaze and phenomenological understanding of a state of being.",

We describe related work on context middleware and the niche CAKE is targeting. We also argue for taking privacy concerns into account and outline how our framework addresses such issues. The concepts behind CAKE are introduced, and we describe how reasoning engines based on different paradigms can be put to work together in our framework.

abstract="Tele-rehabilitation has been widely studied in recent year, although a number of crucial issues has not been addressed. Quantitatively assessing exercise performance is vital in monitoring the progress in exercise based rehabilitation. This allows physiotherapists not only to refine rehabilitation plans, but also provides instant feedback to patients and facilitate the exercise performance in non-clinical setting. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the performance of upper extremity reaching tasks with in a kinematic perspective by assessing the smoothness of motion trajectories with the entropy of shape model, including curvature and torsion. The simulation result confirms that approximate entropy of shape model is consistent with the change of the smoothness in motion trajectory while it is capable of classifying six levels of the ability to perform upper extremity reaching tasks with higher accuracy.",

To simplify the communication, the end user needs smart devices, such as smartphones, smart door openers, smart washing machines or smart mirrors. The latter is investigated deeper in the following paragraphs. The study was performed in an university course -- a technical student project, where the students not only created a concept, but also built a technical prototype of a smart mirror. During this process, the following tasks were accomplished: 1. Building the prototype/connecting all hardware components, 2. Programming a Raspberry-Pi computer in Python for the smart mirror device, including a camera with face scanning feature, different apps like weather forecast, live connected notebook/to-do list, welcome screen with personification and a clock, 3.

abstract="Demographic trends in southern Netherlands predict an increasing aging population in the coming decade. Since there will not be enough health providers available to meet the growing demand of care of the elderly, there is a need to reorganize the Dutch health care system in a more efficient way. In this process, innovative technologies can play an important role. It is speculated that monitoring daily activities may be an effective way to obtain information on well-being of seniors living independently. Alterations in behavior could then be used to support the organization of care delivery to these persons. Technology has become available commercially by which the activities of the elderly living at home are automatically monitored. In the USA this technology mainly is used to support informal carers in their care after their relatives at a distance. The authors speculated that this technology may also be used as a communication infrastructure that can deliver information to care workers. Moreover, this could enable them to re-organize the process of care delivery in such a way that future challenges are met effectively. They were able to set up a series of projects in which this speculation was substantiated. First of all a small pilot experiment was started to demonstrate that the technology was applicable in the province of Limburg in The Netherlands. Not only the technical feasibility could be demonstrated, also the development of a communication infrastructure in which several (international) organizations, each with specific expertise, was completed successfully. Also at the user level (clients and care workers) evidence was gathered that this approach may deliver an adequate support. Next, a large scale implementation project was started. In this project the consequences of data delivery by the technology in the work process of care deliverers was investigated. Instructional courses and new care management tools targeted at home-care workers were developed to support the effective use of this infrastructure. In the mean time other care organizations were invited to participate in the projects. At the client level, evidence is gathered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The research and implementation projects are now financed by grants. It is the intention of the care organization involved, to use this infrastructure in a regular way. This means that a structural financial scheme had to be developed. Thus information was gathered to set up a business case for the future use of this technology.The results obtained up to now will be discussed in this chapter.",

However, the focus should be on rejuvenating the existing dying cities from the plethora of problems they are facing and make them sustainable. In lieu of this, the paper attempts to uncover the environmental disaster of air pollution engulfing the royal Nawabi city of Lucknow which is experiencing a new stage of urbanization and is expanding to its fullest by engulfing the rural fringes. Hasty urbanization poses grave challenge to the environment, which is emerging as an important apprehension and has become a major subject of concern. In this spurious process of expansion, it is attracting negativity which in turn is hampering its own quality. Due to excessive discharge of pollutants like oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, and lead emitted from vehicles, the quality of air is deteriorating. The increased traffic has resulted in increased emission of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter which has enough potential for deterioration of environmental sustainability of any ecosystem and human health too (Nagendra et al. 2004). The quality of air that we are breathing is rapidly changing. Managing the urban environment is becoming an overwhelming dilemma as the city is experiencing critical environmental degradation and is having solemn setback in sustaining human life. Though attempts are being made to curb this problem, huge efforts are still awaited. This paper provides a close view concerning the blow of environment pollution in the perspective of air pollution and problems faced by the citizens.",

Relevant publications from diverse databases, including healthcare, engineering, and robotics were sourced and screened. Ninety-five studies in forty-two study groups have been synthesized. The reported outcomes have been categorized based on five PERMA constructs (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement) in addition to a sixth category (other effects). The findings indicate that SAR has the potential to enhance elderly wellbeing and decrease the workload of caregivers. Based on concerns that emerged during the quality appraisal process, several significant recommendations are made to improve future research and its applicability. Furthermore, acknowledging individuals' needs, expectations, and preferences alongside multi-modal interaction and data collection translates into improvement of personalization of care. The development of new approaches such as web-based interfaces and cloud computing are highly recommended as the means of overcoming the constraints of the limited computing and storage capabilities of SAR. Moreover, human-like engagement characteristics of socially assistive robots should be seamlessly integrated with other assistive technologies such as tele-health, e-health, and smart homes.",

abstract="Online social networks are largely failing to engage people in relevant interactions with people, contents or resources in their physical environment. We motivate the potential of automatically establishing sporadic social networks among people (acquaintances or strangers) who happen to be physically close to one another at a certain moment. We present the design of one platform intended to provide solutions from the lowest level of establishing ad-hoc connections among nearby mobile devices, up to the highest level of automatically identifying the most relevant pieces of information to deliver at any time. A number of application scenarios are presented, along with conclusions from redesigning a former system that delivered immersive learning experiences in museums according to the constructs of the sporadic social networks.",

abstract="In many persuasive health interventions, humanoid robots and other intelligent systems are capable of carrying out meaningful conversations with human subjects in an effort to influence humans towards behavior or attitudinal change. In human-to-human conversations, the listening party often has the ability to discern whether or not certain aspects of the conversation should be kept confidential. Consequently, in conversational service robot scenarios (including elderly care use cases), humans often have the expectation that humanoid robots are capable of preserving the privacy and confidentiality of a given human-robot dialogue. In this literature, we explore the inherent challenges and approaches to modeling confidentiality in human-robot interaction (HRI) dialogue scenarios involving a cloud-enabled networked robot. As a result, we share a novel reference model for designing persuasive dialogue systems.",

The according context-awareness framework is taken from the results of the EU FP 7 project ``C-CAST''. Major novelties include a highly scalable context management architecture as well as a context prediction methodology. The paper considers business models and financial structures as well as service and application examples that might be realized in smart spaces enriched with environmental, personal, social, and network context information. From a commercial perspective on context-aware applications in smart spaces, these examples differ from traditional Telecom and IT services and demonstrate how Telecom and IT companies may strengthen and leverage their business based on context information about customers, services and their environments that is abundantly available in smart spaces. Moreover, this paper includes the description of a field trial with new applications in quasi-smart space environments.",

abstract="Historically cities have evolved as an outcome of the process of urban growth; trade and economy; movement of people, industrialization and trade; and administration. Cities first emerged in Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt and India 5000--6000 years ago long before the growth of modern factory. These cities were, on the one hand centres of religion, political administration and on the other, represented growth centres, stimulated by international trade in spices, gold, cloth and precious goods. The pre-industrialization city was smaller, less densely populated, built within protective walls, and often organized around a central storage and a place of worship. In contrast, the industrial city that began to emerge by the end of eighteenth century, was more dynamic, and had complex social system requiring new means of mass communication. Subsequently, such cities were ridden with a host of social problems such as poverty, pollution, crime (Ong 2011; Smith 2015).",

abstract="Emerging technologies provide the opportunity to develop innovative sustainable service models, capable of supporting adults with dementia at home. Devices range from simple stand-alone components that can generate a responsive alarm call to complex interoperable systems that even can be remotely controlled. From these complex systems the paradigm of the ubiquitous or ambient smart home has emerged, integrating technology, environmental design and traditional care provision. The service context is often complex, involving a variety of stakeholders and a range of interested agencies. Against this backdrop, as anecdotal evidence and government policies spawn further innovation it is critical that due consideration is given to the potential ethical ramifications at an individual, organisational and societal level. Well-grounded ethical thinking and proactive ethical responses to this innovation are required. Explicit policy and practice should therefore emerge which engenders confidence in existing supported living option schemes for adults with dementia and informs further innovation.",

However, prevalent methods only use accelerometers to isolate falls from activities of daily living (ADL). This paper proposes combination of a simple threshold method and acceleration measurement to detect falls and fall-detection. To demonstrate the activity of proposed scheme a device has been designed. We used an Arduino-UNO, also we used MPU6050 as a sensor and we can measure the velocity and acceleration by calculate the derivative for the phase this program was C-language. Several fall-feature parameters and possible falls are calibrated through an algorithm. The implementation of program built to read an analogue variable from its port as an additional adjustment to fixed the upper and the lower. The total sum acceleration vector ACC to distinguish between falling and ADL. The results using the simple threshold, PMU, and combination of the simple method and MPU were compared and analyzed. The proposed MPU reduced the complexity of the hardware also the algorithm exhibited high accuracy.",

abstract="The aim of this chapter is to analyse the impact of long-term technological innovation in the home environment. We analyse the transformation that households may experience due to the increased use of technology. With respect to long-term technology forecasting and social applications, we are discussing conjecture and an acceptable level of probability; we consider speculative estimates of future technologies and the potential uses of these technologies by citizens. In recent years, the scientific literature relating to homes has discussed the home and intelligent building. The word ``smart'' has been supplemented by new concepts, such as the ``aware'' home, integrated environments or live, interactive environments. Similarly, there has been a significant change away from technocentrism and towards paying more attention to the person and a flexible relationship with technology, considering the great potential of technology to consider the real needs of users. We analyse the applications of microrobotics and macrorobotics in medicine. They have been grouped into the following areas: (1) robotic surgery or telesurgery, (2) prosthetics and orthotics and (3) care robots (robots for disabled people and the elderly, Hospital and Research Robots, Nanotechnology).The current technological innovations have a significant impact on shaping the personal and domestic environment. The new values of society, such as concern for the environment and sustainability, the importance of security, information workers or the growing importance of entertainment and leisure in the lives of people, are elements that guide the innovation process. We consider the problem of the digital divide. The state has an important role to play in the development of an inclusive social model that is based on a new way of organising technology. The divide between developing and developed countries and connected and disconnected communities could get deepened. The European model of transition to the knowledge society imposes some limitations on the prevention of a digital divide. The condition for the development of an inclusive knowledge society is education. The state must transform its traditional role, and it must be a provider of infrastructure for the self-organisation of civil society. Modern generations have a culture that favours the introduction of technology into their lives and perceive technology as an opportunity or an advantage rather than as a threat to our humanity. This is a critical factor, and it is a necessary condition to realise the potential of the scientific and technological revolution that characterises most advanced countries. Advances in medical biotechnology have placed us at a new stage. The medicine involved will be eminently predictive/preventive, and robotics and nanotechnology will play a major role.",

They are currently being tested with participants in their own homes. The technology developed is a direct result of the co-working relationship that the team have built up with the participants. Without them there would be no design, and without them there would be no improvements. Throughout the course of this research we have attempted to work with the participants as equals in the project and reflect their wishes in the final designs. It has been a learning experience for all members of the team. We also see that although the applications have been developed on tablets for tablet PCs there is no reason why we cannot use them on standard computers. Similarly, although the applications were developed for older people by older people, there is no reason why they cannot have as much worth with other people in the wider world.",

Our aim is to enable senior citizens to remain in their familiar home environments as long as possible by increasing their feeling for safety and autonomy in a minimally invasive way. Therefore we developed a ZigBee-based smart system which uses distributed accelerometers as main sensory component and does not need the resident to wear any artifact. In this way certain activity patterns could be recognized respecting the users' privacy. We gathered certain ADLs manually from the raw data and validated them in different ways. In this manner 151 out of 155 ADLs could be verified. In this paper an overview of the system together with the findings of the real life tests are presented.",

abstract="The chapter describes bespoke technology developed by the Tel Aviv Municipality, Israel called Digi-Tel. It aims to engage, involve and connect city residents directly to municipal departments, and enable them to benefit from the efficient two-way use of Information Communication Technologies. As such Digi-Tel delivers updated information in a variety of domains, providing municipal services, encouraging residents' engagement, transparency and mobility, with the aim to improve their quality of life. Digi-Tel composes three elements---the people (citizens, residents and visitors), the second a friendly city (quality of life) and the third is data (technology). These essential elements are integrated into the city's vision to create a city for all residents. The local municipality promotes a policy of transparency of the information provided to the general public, enabling residents to access the municipal database on one hand. This encourages residents to proactively engage the municipality, while additionally reporting on events, activities and concerns on the other hand. It manages a variety of components divided into three main classifications---applications, logistical infrastructure and physical infrastructure. As a neo-liberal solution, Digi-Tel raises two questions: (1) what is new and original with this endeavour in comparison to past and present endeavours and (2) what are the actual impacts in terms of effective involvement of ordinary citizens in knowledge production and creation processes.",

abstract="E-participation in decision making is gaining ground. An increasing number of administrational structures currently try to foster innovation processes at all levels of government, supported by EU cooperation strategies and funding. The aim of the paper is to test the usefulness and opportunities deriving from a mix of e-participation and ``proactive'' decision support tools by defining a policymaking process,. The authors present an overview of the work-in-progress of policymaking through a series of methods and tools to encourage participation and identifying consistent and low cost policy choices in PA. We conclude that this bottom-up approach, which is very different from the technology-based smart city paradigm, is extremely useful. It provides institutions with a simple, immediate and free use of a pool of ideas. It also supports administrational structures by organizing a number of basic services in low density rural areas affected by structural limitations in terms of accessibility, loss of population and public services in a better manner and at lower cost.",

abstract="Ubiquitous and pervasive computing contribute significantly to the quality of life for dependent people by providing personalized services in smart environments. Due to the sensitive nature of home scenario, and the invasive nature of surveillance, the deployment of those services still require privacy and trust issues for dependent people. Various technologies have been proposed to address the privacy issue in smart home, however, they rarely consider the feasibility and possibility of their privacy strategies. Given that a huge batch of data is captured and processed in smart home system, it may not be easily implemented as issues related to data sharing and delivery may arise. Our work seeks to aid pub/sub mechanisms in smart home environment with the ability to handle parameterized constraints, simultaneously ensuring users' privacy and solves emergency tasks efficiently.",

abstract="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a recognised global health concern, with currently no cure. Research is now focusing on risk factors and prevention methods associated with AD. Many of these risk factors can be attributed to lifestyle choices and environmental factors. In this paper, we present a smartphone app designed to facilitate, encourage and monitor behaviour change as part of a 6-month randomized control trial with 146 participants. The app provided a convenient, scalable and cost effective method of allowing participants to monitor and review behaviour change data. 94.5{\%} of users entered, and 91.8{\%} reviewed, their performance daily. Over 141,800 individual behaviour logs were submitted across the six-month trial. Analysis of these logs has shown positive trends in behavioural change across all domains, with particular emphasis on efforts to decrease stress, higher sleep promotion and increased social engagement. Respondents' rating of the app's effect on their health improvement: 31{\%} reported ``a great deal of effect'', 48{\%} reported somewhat of an effect, and 3{\%} said the app was the key factor.",

Because of the size of the problem, controlling a smart environment can be effectively approached as a multi-agent task. Individual agents can address a portion of the problem but must coordinate their actions to accomplish the overall goals of the system.

Nowadays, there are 5.5 million cases of Alzheimer-afflicted people in Europe and more new cases being added every year. In fact Alzheimer's disease has been called the ``plague of the twenty-first century''. There is currently no cure for this disease; however, prevention and early diagnosis may play a huge role in delaying the onset of the worst effects of this severe disease. Modern technologies could have an important role to satisfy main needs of people with dementia. Nonetheless, despite recent advancements in information and communication technologies and growing sales numbers, industry has been rather reluctant to standardise access technologies and to implement them in a ``Design for All approach''. Because of this, in last years, there have been launched in Europe a great number of initiatives, both public and private, which try to improve the situation of those persons who suffer this ailment and that will be detailed in this chapter.",

It is mainly based on an IXP425 network processor and a Linux kernel. We first present the hardware and software architectures of BMMRG, and then we introduce their in-detailed implementations. In the meantime, an intelligent home system is proposed based on BMMRG and household appliances equipped with wireless and ZigBee adapters.

abstract="Urban governance in cities is shaped by, and shapes, global discourses. These discourses shape the discussion of how governance should be organized, what forms it takes, what kinds of governance instruments, methods and data are used and what urban governance practices may look like. Much of this is presented in gender- and place/space-neutral, objective language and complex scientific jargon, which obfuscates the highly political nature of the shifts in governance and associated governance theories, instruments, methods and practices. It is assumed that these dimensions can be scaled up and down and transferred to different contexts. Close examination reveals, however, that many of these are being used in the service of the most powerful, while the shift from government to (network) governance creates the illusion of empowering all. In practice, accountability, legitimacy, legality and equity are compromised as the most powerful actors influence the governance process. In the process, public goods and services are being privatized; infrastructure developments relocate the poor and serve the rich; market/economic instruments are replacing regulatory ones; big data and maps can be used manipulatively; and network governance and participatory processes may be more disempowering than empowering. This chapter argues for a deconstruction of discourses, theories, instruments, methods, technologies, practices and outcomes to ensure that these are used in the service of human well being and their ecosystems. This deconstruction should build on an understanding that place specificities are highly relevant and that urban governance is situated in a produced space. Moreover, cities and urban governance do not operate in a vacuum but are related to and intertwined with processes at other scalar levels.",

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which is largely based on Ubiquitous Computing, aims at tutoring and supervising elderly people and users with physical, sensory or cognitive disabilities in the performance of routine household activities. AAL's main aim is to increase the autonomy of dependent people in their daily life by providing them with supportive instructions for everyday routines and warnings about home safety issues. This concept can be extended to public spaces, where ubiquitous accessible services allow people with disabilities to access location-dependent web services (providing maps, addresses, transport schedules, etc.) and local intelligent machines (such as information kiosks or ATMs). This approach allows existing knowledge about the users, their common activities, and their environment to be used to extend the in-home AAL concept to the support of common routines performed outside the home. This chapter surveys the modelling techniques used inside the home and discusses the methodologies required for their extension for out-of-home use, including interoperation and sharing of models.",

abstract="This paper presents a systematic review which explores the nature of assistive technologies currently being designed, developed and evaluated for dementia sufferers and their carers. A search through four large databases, followed by filtering by relevance, led to the identification and subsequent review of papers. Our review revealed that the majority of research in this area focuses on the support of day-to-day living activities, safety monitoring, memory aids and preventing social isolation. We conclude that the majority of AT currently available support day-to-day living activities, safety monitoring and assisting healthcare. However these devices merely address the `ease of living' rather than focusing on `quality of life'. Although there are some devices which address social symptoms of Dementia, few address behavioural issues such as aggression and virtually none are available to support recreational activities. After discussing the implications of these findings, we finally reflect on general design issues for assistive technologies in this domain that became apparent during the review.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a cognitive system that acquires knowledge on elderly daily activities to ensure their wellness in a smart home using a Knowledge-Information-Data (KID) model. The novel cognitive framework called high dimensional conceptual space is proposed and used as KID model. This KID model is built using geometrical framework of conceptual spaces and formal concept analysis (FCA) to overcome imprecise concept notation of conceptual space with the help of topology based FCA. By doing so, conceptual space can be represented using Hilbert space. This high dimensional conceptual space is quantum inspired in terms of its concept representation. The knowledge learnt by the KID model recognizes the daily activities of the elderly. Consequently, the model identifies the scenario on which the wellness of the elderly has to be ensured.",

abstract="IoT technology integrated in smart home environments produces a huge and heterogeneous amount of data that can be used to characterize events that occur inside an environment as well as activities that a person is performing. The knowledge that can be extracted from such data can be used to proactively facilitate the daily living of the person with physical and/or cognitive weaknesses. This paper describes work aiming at better taking advantage of those data by integrating a cognitive loop composed by a semantic representation and a decision making functionality. In particular, the paper presents results of the Knowledge-based cOntinuous Loop (KOaLa) research initiative particularly focusing on the use of semantic technology to represent and reason on sensor data to enable the triggering of proactive services toward the users in an intelligent home.",

In an ever increasingly ageing society, we realize that certain information gathering or support may be required by users in their homes. However, we strongly believe that we should preserve a user's privacy in their home and ensure that any artifact we propose is seen as fun, aesthetically pleasing and most importantly non-stigmatizing. We describe in this paper how a multimodal mobile robot can assist in the monitoring of a home in a fun and unobtrusive way.",

abstract="Over the past decades, a plethora of innovative ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems have been constructed. The acceptance of the systems, however, depends on how users experience them in real contexts. While many of the ubicomp research projects include some form of user study, there is no overview of how user experience (UX) is approached in ubicomp research. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of ubicomp UX studies. Our findings reveal that users`experiences with ubicomp systems have often been investigated in rather lightweight ways, for example by addressing basic usability issues, collecting ratings by simple, predetermined scales, or producing descriptions of general experiences such as fun and trust. Based on the findings we argue that a deeper and more fine-grained understanding of user experience would help developing more successful ubicomp systems. We propose a ubicomp UX framework that can help design and evaluate ubicomp systems with a desirable set of target experiences.",

Through the ProtoPolicy research project we explored the production and use of design fictions as a tool for debating the societal, legal and ethical dimensions of personal health systems. Two design fictions were co-created and tested in a series of design workshops with community groups based in Lancashire and Cornwall, UK. A thematic analysis of a debate among older people from the Lancaster group on the Smart Object Therapist design fiction highlighted societal and ethical issues relevant to personal health system design. We conclude that ethics like `usability' may be usefully based on engagement with directly or indirectly implicated publics and should not be designed into innovation by experts alone.",

abstract="A framework that utilizes audio information for recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs) in the context of a health monitoring environment is presented in this chapter. We propose integrating a Raspberry PI single-board PC that is used both as an audio acquisition and analysis unit. So Raspberry PI captures audio samples from the attached microphone device and executes a set of real-time feature extraction and classification procedures, in order to provide continuous and online audio event recognition to the end user. Furthermore, a practical workflow is presented, that helps the technicians that setup the device to perform a fast, user-friendly and robust tuning and calibration procedure. As a result, the technician is capable of ``training'' the device without any need for prior knowledge of machine learning techniques. The proposed system has been evaluated against a particular scenario that is rather important in the context of any healthcare monitoring system for the elder: In particular, we have focused on the ``bathroom scenario'' according to which, a Raspberry PI device equipped with a single microphone is used to monitor bathroom activity on a 24/7 basis in a privacy-aware manner, since no audio data is stored or transmitted. The presented experimental results prove that the proposed framework can be successfully used for audio event recognition tasks.",

abstract="Exploring the hierarchical structure and internal correlation of chronic disease knowledge network is of great significance to distinguish conceptual terms and core directions of chronic disease area. This paper proposed a descriptive Tomographic Content Analysis method to analyze the cross-section of chronic disease knowledge network. K-core values and clustering coefficients were applied to divide the network into layers. Then vectors for each layer were constructed to calculate their cosine similarities to compare their correlation and differences. Finally, network stratification results were compared with the community modules obtained by the traditional social network analysis from a quantitative perspective. To illustrate the method, a number of 26,717 articles related to hypertension in the PubMed database were taken as examples to construct the chronic disease knowledge network. Results show that the chronic disease knowledge network can be divided into the basic layer, the middle layer and the detailed layer. The basic layer can be used to divide the main research directions of chronic diseases. The detailed layer can be used to characterize the specific research and reveal the microscopic forms of the network. The middle layer can be used to explore the network intersection and evolution paths. Compared with the traditional social network analysis method, our proposed method can obtain more in-depth and detailed hierarchical structures and internal correlations of chronic disease knowledge networks.",

abstract="Citizen engagement has taken many centuries to evolve from its roots during the Greek period, developing along with the concept of democracy to its current form as it is practiced today. Participation in the planning process emerged in Great Britain in the 1940s, and began to become institutionalized in 1960s. This participation increased in popularity during the 1980s and 1990s as it was seen to result in better decision making, and eventually became known as participatory planning.  Citizen involvement continues to evolve and varies with specific context, but is generally aimed to influence the policies and decision making process that shapes the communities and cities of those citizens. More recently, the tools of public engagement are transforming considerably with the advancement and use of ICTs during the digital age, which has led to the emergence of internet-enabled online public engagement, also known as `e-engagement'. Planning in Hong Kong has evolved rapidly over the last two decades, transforming from a top down decision making process to a more participatory process involving active citizen engagement that has become more pronounced since the handover from British Rule in 1997. Since then, with a renewed sense of ownership, the citizens of Hong Kong have become more interested and involved  with the planning and the political processes. However, through more public engagement and increased participatory planning, there can be seen positive changes in various urban processes in Hong Kong such as urban renewal, heritage conservation, harbourfront development. In Hong Kong, information is readily available and accessible both in English and Chinese and in printed and in online formats. In addition to participatory processes, the use of e-engagement is becoming more prevalent for numerous development studies and projects in Hong Kong. The Kai Tak Development Case Study demonstrates that although the planning process has been underway for more than two decades, community involvement has been instrumental in its planning and development to date. There is now a considerable amount of e-engagement in the Hong Kong planning process and various tools are being used and developed to engage people in more creative ways during both formal and informal engagement processes. With the emergence of the digital age and through the use of ICT, e-engagement has become an integral part of citizen engagement. E-engagement has the potential to transform the public participatory process through specific events such as workshops and forums, and the continuous engagement of the public over the internet. ICT also creates the opportunity to be more open, transparent and inclusive by creating a platform for on-going engagement to develop greater trust between the community and NGOs with the public and private sector. While much progress has been made,  e-engagement in Hong Kong can be improved further through the use of various tools and social media available to more effectively engage the wider community rather than only hearing the voices of the vocal minority. This will further remove barriers to the formation of public, private and community partnerships and will help develop Hong Kong into a more affordable, walkable, liveable, sustainable and resilient city for its citizens, as well as become a model for other cities in Asia and the world.",

With little capacity to cope with risks from the in situ climate, added risks from climate change present an overwhelming challenge. The global, long-term and highly uncertain nature of climate change phenomenon has contributed to the remoteness and sparseness of the treatment of climate change risks in the framing of city development policies. Building sustainable and climate resilient cities and communities require quite the opposite approach to conventional urban policies and plans. Several Indian cities have announced policies to build resilience to climate change; however, the extent of institutionalization of climate change resilience in the local government agenda is not well understood. This chapter reviews India's urban development and governance structures in the context of urban climate change resilience. Drawing from the case study of Ahmedabad city's Heat Action Plan, the paper highlights the key issues faced by local governments in mainstreaming climate change resilience in formal urban policies.",

abstract="As the society is becoming superior day-by- day, loads of smart devices are used in different application areas. This is the challenge to the technocrats for forming the intelligent and smart social systems. It requires easy access and fast processing, which is the main focus of any application. In this work, an attempt has been taken into consideration to develop an intelligent e-healthcare system. In e-healthcare system the entities are considered as the patient, the physician, the pathological centre and result as diagnosis, treatment and post care. This paper uses an ANFIS structure for e-healthcare system. Further the ANFIS system is used for disease diagnosis and support to the patient as well as for physicians. For the management of multi-agent system has been satisfied by, using rule based fuzzy parameters. The service can be provided through internet to the patient as well as by the physician. The different situation of patient automatically informs to the doctor similarly the prescription from the doctor for diagnosis can inform to the pathology centre and vice versa. The result of detection communicated to both for desired medicine, monitoring and post care purpose. The performance found to be excellent to satisfy this part of intelligent system.",

Ten relatively healthy independently living older adults were interviewed using ethnographic processes to determine a baseline of social activities, behaviours and nocturnal sleeping routines. Each home was fitted with six sensing elements to establish and monitor daily and nocturnal activities. Sociality behaviours were explored through social contact through phone conversation and human interaction, through mobility, inside and outside the home, and through a person's self reported internal state (how they feel each day). Nocturnal rhythms were examined through actigraph watches and bed pressure sensing devices. A preliminary sub set of the results are presented in this paper in the form of case studies showing subjective and objective data sets and their comparison to social routines.",

Scenario building is the first step of the Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (MAMCA), the methodology used to conduct a broad stakeholder consultation. To emphasize the participative nature of the scenario building, the scenarios were created using the intuitive logics technique and participatory workshops. Each scenario describes future trends and technological, organisational or policy-related solutions. Based on a survey of stakeholders, ``policy {\&} legislative framework'' and ``lifestyle and user behaviour'' emerged as pivotal uncertainties to steer the scenario building. They provided the basis for the development of four scenarios: Data World, Digital Nomads, Slow is Beautiful, and Minimum Carbon. The paper describes the trends and solutions that comprise these scenarios.",

abstract="Modeling and modeling methods are crucial for information systems engineering but are seldom seamlessly integrated into all phases of development and operation: Practitioners challenge the benefits of modeling and complain about the confusing variety of concepts with overlapping semantics, symbols and syntactic rules of today's standardized, ``universal'' modeling languages. Therefore, domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) are gaining increasing popularity: they are lean and convenient, support the productivity of modeling, and help to increase model quality and comprehensibility. There are, however, few approaches to embedding a DSML into a domain-specific modeling method (DSMM) that provides guidelines about how to use a given DSML and to evaluate related models. This chapter aims to make a contribution towards filling that gap by discussing, as an example and proof of concept, a domain-specific modeling method for the human cognitive modeling language HCM-L, a DSML for the domain of active and assisted living. As a modeling language without tool support has no chance to be used in practice, we are conducting that discussion on the basis of HCM-L modeler, a tool that was implemented using the metamodeling platform ADOxx and can be accessed via OMiLAB, the Open Models Laboratory for modeling method engineering. HCM-L modeler is component of an ambient assistance system for supporting elder persons in mastering their daily life activities.",

As a consequence, there are often misconceptions about AAL and smart homes, and the acceptance of AAL technologies is still too low. To cope with these problems, this paper presents a publicly available awareness game called Smart Tales, whose goal is to enhance the familiarity of its players with the notion and core concepts of AAL. In Smart Tales, the player has the role of an assisted patient in a smart home, and gets to learn about AAL and its technologies while trying to cheat the sensors that are placed in the house. In addition to presenting the design of the game following the Serious Games Design Assessment framework from the literature, we present results on engagement and learning that we obtained through a formative evaluation with ten users.",

abstract="The EU-funded project RADIO brings forward a new healthcare paradigm according to which a mobile robotic platform can act as an assistant to an elderlyElderlyperson in his/her domestic environment. The main goal of the robot is to detect ADL (Activities of Daily Life) related to basic self-care tasks, such as sleeping and taking medications, as well as instrumental ADL related to housework. ADL detection is based on visual, depth, and audio signal analysis as well as their fusion. However, robot assistance in everyday living suffers from limited autonomy dictated by the robot battery, e.g., the robot has to constantly know where the person is and to be able to move if the person moves to a new location or another room. In this chapter, we present the line of research followed in the RADIO project in order to reduce the usage of the power-hungry processing components and, consequently, the need for revisiting, to the extent possible, the robot charging station. Our approach is based on building specialized, hardware accelerationHardware accelerationunits on a Zynq-based FPGA of Xilinx. Moreover, a hardware--software partitioning approach is performed base on the HLSHigh-Level Synthesis (HLS)(high-level synthesis) paradigm. In this way, the robot will be able to perform computation-intensive tasks in a power-efficient manner.",

abstract="Real-time monitoring of the physical condition of the elderly people has become mandatory nowadays. The reason for rise in demand of aging services is due to the rise of the elderly population. We need precise, fast and effective transmission of information about their health condition to the concerned. Also there lies a need to transmit more parameters and more data for the convenience and effective response by the concerned people. Since we need an effective response we make use of the voice-call facility apart from the SMS mechanism also. The system proposed here called Noninvasive Elder Monitoring System (NEMS) monitors blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and ECG of the elders. Any critical condition is reported to the medical service center and relatives via an SMS and voice call, to arrange for proper services to the elder at right time. We make use of the GSM modem for the SMS and voice call facility.",

abstract="This chapter poses the following research question: Which social actions in modern urban neighbourhoods aid the transition to a post-carbon society and mitigate the effects of global warming (IPCC 2014)? The answer is based on the capacity of communities to generate knowledge-creation processes and innovative initiatives. It is assumed that transition actions are based on experiential knowledge creation, which strengthens them when in the midst of crises derived from unsustainable production and consumption processes, leading them to reject conventional strategies and experiment with alternatives. Such transition initiatives include the participation energy programme (PEP), community urban agriculture (CUA), change market, cooperatives and fab labs, among others, reflecting an experiential knowledge creation (EKC) process, based on supporting innovation in social actions through people's interactions, with both explicit (formal) and tacit (common) dimensions. It is also assumed that experiential knowledge is in a continual process of change, refining optimum responses to any circumstance that empowers people. Within this framework, the chapter examines the process taking place in a neighbourhood of Barcelona which is situated within the transition towns movement. For data collection, eight semi-structured interviews (70 minutes average in length) were undertaken to collect data on the process and Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) model on knowledge creation was used to analyse the data.",

This paper presents a method for reliably collecting data events from sensors and forwarding the data via a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) to sensor monitoring stations located on an external network. At the core is a MANET concept that consists of ground and unmanned aircraft (UA) nodes. UA enable a model whereby widely spaced sensors are intermittently connected to the network and data are sent in stages as connections become available along each stage. This paper describes our efforts to build such a network for a real application. The paper describes the sensor data collection model, the reliable multicast data delivery mechanism, and our experiences so far in this project. In particular, it describes our existing network test bed and the control of an UA through a MANET. It specifically targets assisted living residents and others who may benefit from continuous, remote health monitoring. We present the advantages, objectives, and status of the design.",

abstract="Understanding today's telecommunications industry is a prerequisite for a successful architectural transformation. The tremendous changes of the industry during the last decades have completely altered their rules and structures. In the past, traditional---mainly government-owned---telecommunications operators were responsible for the technical realization of fixed-line and mobile radio communications. Their business model was based on long-term infrastructure investments that were financed through usage-based connection fees. Today, competitors of traditional operators do not necessarily require their own network infrastructure---such as, for example, Over-The-Top (OTT) providers. Increasingly, the technical connection is becoming a commodity. Innovative applications, convergent services, and dedicated customer orientation are today's success factors. However, increasing data volumes and mobile usage still requires ongoing modernization of network technologies. A major challenge for telecommunications operators is the combination of continuous innovation requirements with a stagnating market and changing value chains. Section 2.1 explains the market conditions and ecosystem with respect to price decrease and cost pressure, competition through Over-the-Top providers, new opportunities in vertical markets, and challenges for regulators. The interrelation between commercial and technical products as well as changed customer demands and usage behavior are discussed in Sect. 2.2. The value chain reacts to the changed market conditions through increased fragmentation of the value creation and new partnering, which are topics of Sect. 2.3.",

In this paper we present a system we developed using multiple sensors for autonomous monitoring and control with relatively low cost components. The sensors we integrated together in to one central operation unit can monitor room temperature, humidity, human motion activity etc. We present a prototype implementation of an energy efficient home environment using our proposed centralized monitoring platform.

For example, lighting in the home can be controlled or an emergency call can be triggered if sensors hidden in the floor detect a fall of a person. It makes sense to also use these technologies regarding prevention and early detection of diseases. By detecting deviations and behavioral changes through long-term monitoring of daily life activities it is possible to identify physical or cognitive diseases. In this work, we first examine in detail the existing possibilities to recognize the activities of daily life and the capability of such a system to conclude from the given data on illnesses. Then we propose a model for the use of floor-based sensor technology to help diagnose diseases and behavioral changes by analyzing the time spent in bed as well as the walking speed of users. Finally, we show that the system can be used in a real environment.",

abstract="When the first edition of this book was published domestic robotsdomestic roboticswere spoken of as a dream that was slowly becoming reality. At that time, in 2008, we looked back on more than twenty years of research and development in domestic robotics, especially in cleaning robotics. Although everybody expected cleaning to be the killer app for domestic robotics in the first half of these twenty years nothing big really happened. About ten years before the first edition of this book appeared, all of a sudden things started moving. Several small, but also some larger enterprises announced that they would soon launch domestic cleaning robots. The robotics community was anxiously awaiting these first cleaning robots and so were consumers. The big burst, however, was yet to come. The price tag of those cleaning robots was far beyond what people were willing to pay for a vacuum cleaner. It took another four years until, in 2002, a small and inexpensive device, which was not even called a cleaning robot, brought the first breakthrough: Roomba. Sales of the Roomba quickly passed the first million robots and increased rapidly. While for the first years after Roomba's release, the big players remained on the sidelines, possibly to revise their own designs and, in particular their business models and price tags, some other small players followed quickly and came out with their own products. We reported about theses devices and their creators in the first edition. Since then the momentum in the field of domestics robotics has steadily increased. Nowadays most big appliance manufacturers have domestic cleaning robots in their portfolio. We are not only seeing more and more domestic cleaning robots and lawn mowers on the market, but we are also seeing new types of domestic robots, window cleaners, plant watering robots, tele-presence robots, domestic surveillance robots, and robotic sports devices. Some of these new types of domestic robots are still prototypes or concept studies. Others have already crossed the threshold to becoming commercial products.",

abstract="With the ever increasing device count and the introduction of wireless pervasive computing in building automation, in order 1) to enhance people life comfort and safety and 2) to optimize the consumption cost of public utility services like energy and water; it is becoming more than crucial to automatically manage these commonly known smart buildings. Indeed, in this research work, we propose a platform that addresses the problem of energy management of different electric devices in a smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT) building and particularly high performance computing (HPC) data centers. This platform integrates the mobile technology as a means to facilitate the maintenance operations usually executed by the mobile workforce agents on smart building electric devices. Another important issue integrated in this proposed platform deals with the monitoring of a life safety plan in case of an emergency scenario due, for instance, to fire detection. The emergency rescue monitoring is eased by the use of mobile devices such as the tablets, usually handled by people in a smart ICT building.",

Several approaches are proposed to recognize activities namely intrusive and non-intrusive approaches. This paper presents a new fully non-intrusive approach for recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart environments. Our approach treats the activity recognition process as an information retrieval problem in which ADLs are represented as hierarchical models, and patterns associated to these ADLs models are generated. A search process for these patterns is applied on the sequences of activities recorded when users perform their daily activities. We show through experiments on real datasets recorded in real smart home how our approach accurately recognizes activities.",

With a steadily increasing elderly population in Europe [1] and indeed throughout significant parts of the rest of the world, health services for elderly people are placing a growing strain on national health budgets [2] and the availability of nursing and care taker staff. Additionally, perhaps due to the advent of technology in general and changing social relations in society, there is an ever-increasing wish amongst our elderly citizens to live independently and be mobile for as long as possible. Recent advances in telecommunications, medical devices and technology in the home environment have enabled elderly people to live independently for longer than ever before. However, integrated systems targeting the monitoring of these elders' health in the home environment are at best scarce.",

abstract="In the post-liberalization period in India, the state has undertaken ventures in collaboration with private actors in the name of development and urbanization. People losing land, livelihood and being uprooted from their settlements is quite common in the context of states with emerging urban spaces, whether in the form of infringement on farm lands for the setting up of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) or the removal of slums for city development. While doing so, the state often invisibilises the concerns of a particular section of the population who then becomes victims to the process of `development'. The attempt in this chapter is to capture these ideas within the framework of statehood, governance strategies and the people by invoking both primary and secondary sources of data in the context of a fast growing urban centre, i.e. Visakhapatnam in the state of Andhra Pradesh.",

PCC is an ideal care principle, which monitors and understands individual circumstances, and plans and executes optimized care. Since the current systems individually manage different user contexts, reusing the contexts across multiple systems is quite different. In this paper, we propose a new service that uniformly manages the user context, and allows external applications to retrieve necessary user contexts efficiently. More specifically, the proposed service gathers heterogeneous data from different systems, and standardizes the data with a common database with domain-independent attributes of when, who, whom, where, what, how, and why. Using a practical use case, we show how the proposed service efficiently manages user contexts.",

abstract="This chapter focuses on the role of Sustainable Living Labs for the implementation and diffusion of low resource and sustainable Product-Service Systems (SPSS) in a ``Green Economy''. In recent years the concept of ``Green Economy'' has emerged as a strategic priority for governments and intergovernmental organisations. Several governmental and industrial strategies reflect aspects of a variety of its definition searching for implementation of its principles. Therefore, we will start off by giving an overview of different definitions of the green economy showing its relevance for micro-oriented approaches. Subsequently, eight key areas of intervention in a Green Economy, which set up the frame and orientation of our sustainable Living Lab (SLL) approach (Sect. 4.1), are presented. The Sect. 4.2 deals with the relevance of Living Labs for the transformation process of the socio-economic regime. This process consists of changing the production-consumption systems towards sustainability through modifying processes and SPSS on the micro level. SLL focuses on sustainability innovations and offers a number of new characteristics reflecting the intervention arenas, which are described in Sect. 4.3. The Sustainable Living Lab approach offers fundamental sustainability-oriented research infrastructure, in which relevant actors are actively integrated into the development, design and testing of new PSS aiming for the transition of our sociotechnical regime towards sustainability. SLL use a three-phase-model as their methodological framework, a description of which is also provided in Sect. 4.3. The actor integrated innovation process is described in a case study from Germany dealing with one of the most relevant areas of needs: heating and airing. It shows a high potential of social innovation for sustainable development. This could foster a more human need oriented and low investment technical development of low-resource SPSS. (see Sects. 4.4 and 4.5). The chapter concludes with an outlook (Sect. 4.6).",

Following a user-centric design approach through cultural probes, we have explored the design space of possible programming opportunities for elderly users. Accordingly we have identified interaction techniques and candidate artefacts that could offer this user group a seamless programming experience for augmenting their ambient environment with software driven personalized behavior. Three aspects of programming - behavior generation, modification and (de) activation are addressed using two tangible user interfaces - i) NFC cards for smart behavior creation and modification and ii) a digital memo board as a placeholder for (de) activation of intelligent behavior. A qualitative feasibility study suggests that the proposed approach is simple, comprehensive and has the potential to be easily incorporated in the everyday routines of the elderly end-users.",

pages="185--208",
abstract="For caregivers of persons with disabilities, the importance of their caregiving can be reflected on a continuum that at one end supports the beginning of life and at the other end supports the end of life (see Fig. 12.1). Since the early 1980s, infants who needed a medical device to compensate for a vital organ or body function and were thus technology dependent, have been sent home from the hospital with their parent caregivers because of cost reductions and better developmental outcomes for the children (Cross et al., Issues in Comprehensive Pediatric Nursing 21:63--84, 1998). One of the most critical factors that determined whether technology-dependent children had extended hospital stays or were able to be cared for at home was the ability and commitment of the parent caregivers to manage the technology (Cross et al., Issues in Comprehensive Pediatric Nursing 21:63--84, 1998; Odom and Chandler, Early Childhood Special Education 9(4): 43--54, 1990; Perkins, Journal of Pediatric Nursing 8(1): 2--9, 1993). Likewise, when support is needed at the end of life, caregivers of a family member in the final stages of life secondary to a disorder or condition such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, or cancer often must master technologies to administer oxygen, nourishment, and pain-relieving medications (Aranda and Hayman-White, Cancer Nursing, 24:300--307, 2001; Caring for people with Huntington's disease, http://endoflifecare.tripod.com/juvenilehuntingtonsdisease/id179.html, 2005; Gibson and Schroder, American Journal of Hospice {\&} Palliative Care 18(1):19--25, 2001; Twilight brigade: Compassion in action, http://www.thetwilightbrigade.com/, 2008). In between the two ends of the caregiving continuum, caregivers use technology to support persons with disabilities so that they can carry out the activities that constitute the fabric of their everyday lives---eating, toileting, bathing, dressing, transferring and communicating, as well as participate in the social roles valued by these persons---such as parent, volunteer, teacher, lawyer, spouse, or coach. Technologies designed to support persons with disabilities also have the potential to reduce the need for personal assistance and reduce caregiver burden.",

Materials and methods: Ten Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or both, from seven different ethnic groups in Sydney. Six key discussion points were used to conduct the FGIs. The participants were shown a video demonstrating the HTMS and its operation, followed by the demonstration of an HTMS prototype. The participants, who had no prior experience with the HTMS, were then asked questions to access their perceptions in potentially real situations. The discussions were audio-taped and content analysis performed. Results: Four major themes and 16 sub-themes were identified. The themes were: intention to use the HTMS, the impact of the HTMS on patients' health management, concerns associated with using the HTMS, and the impact of the HTMS on healthcare services.",

The ancient city of Megiddo in the Middle East---after which the word ``armageddon'' was derived to mean ``a dramatic and catastrophic conflict, especially one seen as likely to destroy the world or the human race''---is now just a large archaeological mound. Those working on the site have found twenty-two cities buried beneath the surface that were built and destroyed at some point in history. Megiddo's problem was that it lay in the path of invading armies from the east and west.",

The classes of assistive products that are well defined in the international standard, ISO9999 such as assistive products for personal medical treatment, personal care and protection, communication, information and reaction and for personal mobility, will be easily incorporated in our proposed platform. Furthermore, our platform could integrate and implement the above classes under several service models that will be analyzed further.",

Each of the existing electronic systems offer services that cover different needs of ageing people living, such as self-determined life at home, social interaction, etc. In this paper we propose a set of service components that constitute a model for an e-service architecture capable to support the autonomy of older people. Furthermore, we argue that by exploiting existing operational electronic systems and integrate them according to the services they offer we can possibly converge to an ideal system that enhances assisted living of elderly people.",

abstract="Within Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) context awareness is an important feature of intelligent user assisting services. In this domain different requirements regarding context modeling can be identified that are not in the focus of current context models. One important aspect is the support of an end user interface for describing context dependent service behaviour. An inhabitant of a smart home needs to get and give feedback on context in a way that can be understood and handled without context modeling expertise. At the same time such simplified context description must be matched on the technical details of context sensing and context dependent service adaptivity. In this paper we introduce a layered context model for AAL which provides different abstraction levels. Therein we focus on model elements and concepts on the user interface layer.",

Technology has taken over heavy physical work but also made our spare time more sedentary, spent watching television, surfing the net, or using smartphones. This growing inactivity is worrying, also regarding older people. An active lifestyle is an important contributor to keeping older adults healthy and independent for as long as possible. Can we turn around this development and use technology to enhance physical activity in older people instead? In this chapter, we take a look at the evidence of the potential for technology to enhance physical activity among older people and the promises as well as the challenges related to this. In addition, we present implications for practice and highlight future directions.",

We propose a hierarchical search system consisting of three layers: (1) local search, (2) global search and (3) exploration. This approach extends the sensory variety of the mobile service robot by employing additional smart home sensors for the object search. Therefore, the robot is no more limited to its on-board sensors. Furthermore, we provide a visual feedback system integrated into the smart home to effectively inform the user about the current state of the search process. We evaluated our system in a fetch-and-delivery task, and the experimental results revealed a more efficient and faster search compared to a search without support of a smart home. Such a system can assist elderly people, especially people with cognitive impairments, in their home environments and support them to live self-determined in old age.",

abstract="With the advent of smart phones, data collection from low cost sensors like accelerometer has become easy and inexpensive. Accelerometer data plays a very important role in activity recognition of individuals. Recognition of human activity is useful in a variety of applications like monitoring physical activity, providing context-aware services and providing assistance to the elderly to name a few. This provides us with a challenging task of analysing the data thus collected which has an inherent uncertainty. In this study, we explore a symbolic data representation method for generation of features from the raw time series data collected by accelerometer sensors present in Android based phones. The experiments are carried out on a benchmark dataset for activity recognition. The data generated is validated for the activity recognition task using different individual classifiers and also ensemble classifiers. The proposed data representation which is space efficient gives promising results and the experiments conducted also lay emphasis on the use of ensemble classifiers.",

abstract="Whatever traveling abroad or within their's own cities, everyone aims at optimizing their route in terms of time, distance or even sightseeing. But, finding the best path in a crowded city is very challenging in terms of continuous changing traffic conditions, road maintenance state and user needs. Most people are busy with daily-basis activities, but elders tend to walk more and, therefore, they develop expertise on the traffic state and/or the presence of works going on the roads. Our driving ides is to take advantage of the knowledge that elderly can gather. For example, a tourist can go sightseeing in a new city by using an elder's advice. When decisions are based on information collected from other individual, trust management is a key problem. Also in our case, we must deal with the problem of the freshness of the elder's information and the trustworthiness of their knowledge. Our work presents a solution for this issue by proposing a new trust management in participatory sensing for path optimization using cloud based services.",

Older members of society have needs from IT which can be quite specific, reflecting their living arrangements and increased likelihood of suffering from physical and cognitive impairments. So how can businesses offering IT services understand these needs to develop products and services that this demographic group (and their carers) will be willing to adopt? In this paper we outline the process we went through to attempt to answer this question. Because our research involved elderly and (in some cases) disabled trial participants, the process had ethical considerations at the forefront, which on occasion affected the operational processes involved in bringing the trial to life. We describe the various challenges we encountered, where possible how we overcame them (by balancing commercial, stakeholder and participant requirements or by compromising where we could not), and what we learnt for future trials.",

abstract="To face new challenges caused by society aging, several researchers have initiated the experimentation of serious games as a re-education platform to help slowing down the decline of people suffering from Alzheimer. In the last few years, academic studies have been conducted and some commercial products (Nintendo's Brain Age, Big Brain Academy, etc.) have emerged. Nevertheless, these initiatives suffer from multiple important limitations since they do not really suit perceptual and interaction needs of silver-aged gamers, more specifically people suffering from Alzheimer disease. In an effort to address this important issue, we present in this paper a set of specific guidelines for designing and implementing effective serious games targeting silver-aged and Alzheimer's patients. Our guidelines cover the following aspects: (i) choosing right in-game challenges, (ii) designing appropriate interaction mechanisms for cognitively impaired people, (iii) implementing artificial intelligence for providing adequate assistive prompting and dynamic difficulty adjustments, (iv) producing effective visual and auditory assets to maximize cognitive training. Also, as a case study, we present the prototype of our new serious game for Alzheimer's patients.",

abstract="In smart home applications, accurate sensor-based human activity recognition is based on learning patterns online from collections of sequential sensor events. A more challenging problem is to discover and learn unknown activities that have not been observed or predefined. This is because in a real-world environment, it is impractical to presume that users/residents will only accomplish a set of predefined activities over a long-term period. To address the issues of classifying sequential data where there are multiple sensor-based activities which might be overlapping, we propose an Online Hidden Condition Random Field (OHCRF) using Resilient Gradient Algorithm (RGA) to recognize human activity behaviors. The discriminative nature of our OHCRF models the sequential observations of an online stream, resolving the level of biased data and over-fitting. The proposed adaptive RGA approach is used to update OHCRF's parameters for online learning. Compared with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the proposed adaptive RGA converges faster, and has an efficient and transparent adaptation process. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art methods for sequential sensor-based activity recognition involving datasets acquired from residents in smart home test-beds.",

abstract="The aging population, prevalence of chronic diseases, and outbreaks of infectious diseases are some of the major healthcare challenges. To address these unmet healthcare challenges, monitoring and Activity Recognition (AR) are considered as a subtask in pervasive computing and context-aware systems. Innumerable interdisciplinary applications exist, underpinning the obtrusive sensory data using the revolutionary digital technologies for the acquisition, transformation, and fusion of recognized activities. However, little importance is given by the research community to make the use of non-wearables i.e. unobtrusive sensing technologies. The physical state of human pervasively in daily living for AR can be seamlessly presented by acquiring health-related information by using unobtrusive sensing technologies to enable long-term health monitoring without violating an individual's privacy. This paper aims to propose and provide supervised recognition of Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) by observing unobtrusive sensor events using statistical reasoning. Furthermore, it also investigates their semantic correlations by defining semantic constraints with the support of ontological reasoning. Extensive experiments were performed with real-world dataset shared by the University of Ja{\'e}n Ambient Intelligence (UJAmI) Smart Lab in order to recognize the human activities in the smart environment. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the supervised method (87{\%}) is comparable to the one, state of the art semantic approach (91{\%}).",

This paper focuses on how to coach a user so that his/her motion gets closer to the good template of a target motion. It is important to efficiently advise the user to emulate the crucial features that define the good template. The proposed system (1) automatically mines the crucial features of any kind of motion from a set of motion features and (2) gives the user feedback about how to modify the motion through an intuitive interface. The crucial features are mined by feature sparsification through binary classification between the samples of good and other motions. An interface for motion coaching is designed to give feedback via different channels (e.g., visually, aurally), depending on the type of error. To use the total system, all the user must do is just move and then get feedback on the motion. Following experimental results, open problems for future work are discussed.",

Recent studies on the technology are cited in this chapter in order to give an overall outlook of the current discussion on the topic including on the issue of ethics. The objectives of the ethical consideration have to be grounded to the main objective of benefitting the society as a whole. As such, individual rights to access of information, system configuration, and education regarding autonomous technology should be upheld. In the end, it is important to integrate the autonomous systems into larger, interdependent transportation network systems in planning the future urban infrastructure and realize the full benefits of the technologies.",

A person with dementia should receive the counseling as often as possible. However, it is difficult for a limited number of caregivers to spare sufficient time and effort. This motivated us to exploit the virtual agent technology we are developing, for implementing daily dementia counseling system at home. However, our previous system relies on static dialogue scripts. Therefore, it is difficult to realize person-centered conversations that are essential to the dementia counseling. In this paper, we propose a method that dynamically generates personalized dialogues for individual people with dementia. The proposed method extensively uses life history and linked open data (LOD). More specifically, we obtain the life history of a user based on The Center Method, then the system choose appropriate conversation considering the history. During the conversation, the system finds new information in LOD relevant to the response and uses it to develop further conversation. We also implement a prototype to show practical feasibility of the proposed method.",

abstract="The ageing population is leading to a significant impact on current society and it is introducing new challenges to find innovative solutions to help older adults to improve their quality of life, stay healthier, and live independently. In this context, the present paper provides a usability assessment of a Smart Kitchen developed to support people with the early-stage dementia in cooking activities. The smart system is managed through an adaptable user interface, which provides information on the meal preparation and allows to configure and manage all household appliances in a simple and intuitive way. Although this preliminary evaluation only included a small number of participants, the results showed that the system could be useful to help and guide people to remain independent in their own home environment for daily kitchen activities.",

abstract="The advent of digital medical data has brought an exponential increase in information available for each patient, allowing for novel knowledge generation methods to emerge. Tapping into this data brings clinical research and clinical practice closer together, as data generated in ordinary clinical practice can be used towards rapid-learning healthcare systems, continuously improving and personalizing healthcare. In this context, the recent use of Data Science technologies for healthcare is providing mutual benefits to both patients and medical professionals, improving prevention and treatment for several kinds of diseases. However, the adoption and usage of Data Science solutions for healthcare still require social capacity, knowledge and higher acceptance. The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of needs, opportunities, recommendations and challenges of using (Big) Data Science technologies in the healthcare sector. This contribution is based on a recent whitepaper (http://www.bdva.eu/sites/default/files/Big{\%}20Data{\%}20Technologies{\%}20in{\%}20Healthcare.pdf) provided by the Big Data Value Association (BDVA) (http://www.bdva.eu/), the private counterpart to the EC to implement the BDV PPP (Big Data Value PPP) programme, which focuses on the challenges and impact that (Big) Data Science may have on the entire healthcare chain.",

abstract="City traffic is getting more multi-modal, with a variety of actors and mobility options in mixed spaces. This makes decisions on traffic behaviour and control more complex. Beyond traditionally considered aspects (e.g. traffic state or used vehicle), human aspects (e.g. physical state, displacement goal, or companion), gain increasing relevance. They can greatly modify how people move and interact with others. Introducing social knowledge about human behaviour and context can help to better understand and anticipate the environment and its actions. This paper proposes the development of Social-Aware Driver Assistance Systems (SADASs) for that purpose. A SADAS uses traffic social properties that formalize social knowledge using a template organized around diagrams. The diagrams are compliant with a specific modelling language, which is intended to describe social aspects in a given context. They facilitate the integration of this knowledge with system specifications, and its semi-automated verification both in design and run time. A case study on a distributed obstacle detection system for vehicles extended with social knowledge to anticipate people' behaviour illustrates the approach.",

abstract="Mobile wearable and sensor-enabled devices offer an opportunity for deluging unprecedented amount of health-related data that is beneficial in health and caregiving research. Fusing data ingested throughout various heterogeneous channels is essential for better provisioning novel healthcare solutions. However, this is typically challenged by privacy-awareness. For example, the European Commission throughout its call-for-proposals always stresses a requirement that provisioned solutions should consider privacy and should boost security- and privacy-awareness in cloud computing environments. Current solutions either do not consider privacy requirements or provide solutions that are mostly ad hoc and patch efforts. In this position paper, we motivate the adoption of Blockchain technologies for providing privacy-awareness to novel healthcare data fusion solutions. Our envisioned solution is proposed on top of current state-of-the-art blockchain and big data representatives, specifically Hyperledger Fabric and Apache Spark.",

abstract="The term ``Smart Home'' refers to a home equipped with sensors, which observe the environment and the actions of its occupants, and actuators, which automatically control the home ambience and devices. A Smart Home can provide a variety of services to its occupants, based on information gleaned from the data recorded by the sensors and using the automation afforded by the actuators. Our work in the Smart-CondoTM project has been motivated by healthcare concerns: we aim to support people with chronic conditions to live independently longer. To that end, our first objective has been to develop an accurate location- and activity-recognition method. In this paper, we describe the Smart-CondoTM middleware architecture, focusing on its occupant-localization feature. We report on simulation experiments with three sensor placements, one of which was deployed at a recent indoor localization competition. Finally, we draw a comparison between the simulated and real-world results, showing the potential practical significance of our methodology.",

abstract="Model-driven development approaches such as Model Driven Architecture (MDA) have been proposed as the new paradigm for software development. The adoption of MDA is still low, partly because of the general-purpose modelling language being used. Domain specific modelling languages are being developed for technological and industrial domains to improve the expressiveness and effect of model-driven development techniques. The healthcare domain could benefit from these methodologies. In order to incorporate domain knowledge in a MDA process, information about workflows, artefacts and actors can be formalized in a UML profile and applied by MDA tools for design and development. This paper presents the work done on model-driven development of smart homecare services in the MPOWER project. Following an iterative approach, two UML profiles to support development of Service Oriented Architecture based homecare applications are proposed. Using homecare specific UML profiles indicate an improvement in the process for model-driven development of homecare services.",

abstract="Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are novel and emerging technologies that allow a person to interact with the environment without any muscular activity using only his or her brain. Currently, there are various applications of neurorehabilitation, which have emerged from this technology. These are based mainly on the performance of motor imagery tasks and visualization of movement, which encourage a process of neuroplasticity. Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative approach that is used in numerous neurorehabilitation applications. Several studies have combined BCIs and VR to develop applications, which allow a person to navigate in virtual environments or to play video games, among others. Some studies have been focused on neurorehabilitation applications, such as applications that allow a person to control virtual limbs. However, nowadays neurorehabilitation has become essential to our society, and this resulted in a substantial increase in BCI research directed toward this field. This chapter will introduce the current state of the art in BCI systems developed for neurorehabiliation applications, among which are innovative studies that make use of VR.",

abstract="Beginning dementia is a major cause for leaving the familiar home environment and moving into a retirement home. This means loss of independence for the individuals and leads to growing expenses for the health-care system. While many solutions for ambient assisted living (AAL) provide support for monitoring and enabling dementia patients to stay longer in the home environment, the actual use of AAL solutions lags behind expectation. A major challenge is to satisfy the information needs of different stakeholders in the dementia care process while paying attention to the privacy concerns at the same time. In this chapter, a concept is introduced to autonomously process and analyze collected data in the home environment. The concept is part of the ``SAKI'' project which is funded by the Federal German Government. By using data mining and artificial intelligence, the tremendous amount of data can be analyzed in-home and only sent outside when defined critical situations are detected. Therefore, existing AAL solutions are combined to detect significant patterns where external help or information is required. Three types of actors in the field of dementia care can profit from this development: The patient himself is provided with real-time feedback of his cognitive and behavioral performance. Family members are provided with summarized and abstracted information to monitor the patient's well-being and their level of autonomy. Professional caregivers are provided with detailed information on daily activities and medical information, which can be integrated in the caregiver's information technology system.",

abstract="Though widely promoted as needing to play a significant role in future healthcare systems, Digital Homecare could serve to complicate situations for patients and care providers unless it becomes much easier to create, deliver and manage the complex mix of technology, support and services that are appropriate to a patient at a specific time. Any holistic approach to Digital Homecare must be able to support a patients' Physiological, Physical, Emotional and Environmental care needs. Furthermore, solutions must meet the requirements of patients' family and friends who will need to take on much more participative supporting roles if Digital Homecare is ever to be deployed on a scale that will alleviate stretched healthcare resources and save the millions of dollars that studies claim can be saved. In all but the simplest of systems the patient gateway is a key technology component. Intelligent Gateways are critical to driving mass adoption of Digital Homecare. Without them, Digital Homecare solutions will remain the niche, high end technology applications that they are today functioning only in un-integrated silos. Current and future participants in the Digital Homecare sector should focus on developing more intelligent gateways to ensure mass adoption.",

The long-term goal is to generate alerts that notify care givers of changes in a resident's condition so they could intervene and prevent or delay adverse health events.

abstract="City traffic is getting more multi-modal, with a variety of actors and mobility options in mixed spaces. This makes decisions on traffic behaviour and control more complex. Beyond traditionally considered aspects (e.g. traffic state or used vehicle), human aspects (e.g. physical state, displacement goal, or companion), gain increasing relevance. They can greatly modify how people move and interact with others. Introducing social knowledge about human behaviour and context can help to better understand and anticipate the environment and its actions. This paper proposes the development of Social-Aware Driver Assistance Systems (SADASs) for that purpose. A SADAS uses traffic social properties that formalize social knowledge using a template organized around diagrams. The diagrams are compliant with a specific modelling language, which is intended to describe social aspects in a given context. They facilitate the integration of this knowledge with system specifications, and its semi-automated verification both in design and run time. A case study on a distributed obstacle detection system for vehicles extended with social knowledge to anticipate people' behaviour illustrates the approach.",

abstract="Much has been written about the benefits, for example, greater independence, autonomy, and dignity, which can derive from the use of assistive technologies with older people (Loader, Hardey, {\&} Keeble, 2009; McCreadie {\&} Tinker, 2005; Poser {\&} Moser, 2009). These benefits have been well researched, clearly expressed in the literature, and remain uncontested here. Apart from benefits to individuals and carers, assistive technologies can release funds for other applications, and where this is in care settings funded through public expenditure, the cost savings that might arise from their application may afford the opportunity for more effective targeting of taxpayer's resources. As the Audit Commission (guardian of public expenditure in the UK) noted, the use of technology represents the unusual possibility of providing cost savings at the same time as better service provision (Audit Commission, 2004). The merits then are evident. But there is a need also to be alert to the ethical questions that arise as a concomitant to the use of new technologies and to address what Mort, Roberts, and Milligan (2009) have argued is an ``ethical and democratic deficit in this field which has arisen due to a proliferation in research and development of advanced care technologies that has not been accompanied by sufficient consideration of their social context'' (p. 85). This chapter will raise these ethical issues, alight on the potential deficits, and highlight some of the policy and practical issues that might warrant further inquiry. It does so by addressing three key areas. First, it considers ethical approaches commonly in use and their limitations for application in the field of assistive technologies. Second, it explores the ethical issues that arise around the design and execution of research with users of assistive technologies. Third, it raises the question of whether or not assistive technologies contribute to a better quality of life (QoL) for recipients, not least because QoL is explicitly included as an intended policy outcome of the deployment of such technologies (Scottish Government, 2009; Telecare Services, 2010). The chapter draws its examples primarily from the experience of the UK (and its devolved polities), where the policy objectives of governments for extending the use of assistive technologies are particularly ambitious. We are mindful of the methodological pitfalls of cross-national applicability, but the discussion should have broader resonance, as ethical approaches and practices come to terms with a technologically fast-changing world. Our use of the term assistive technologies embraces the definition of any item, piece of equipment, product, or system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities (Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act, 1988 P.L.100/407); more practicably, as Cowan and Turner Smith (cited in McCreadie {\&} Tinker, 2005) note, it refers to any device or system that allows an individual to perform a task that they would otherwise be unable to do or increases the ease and safety with which the task can be performed. We note in particular that some of the more interesting ethical challenges have arrived with the advent of telecare sensor-based technologies, which open up important issues around privacy, autonomy, and the potential for replacement of human care through remote monitoring.",

It is given by the development of demographic and age structure of the population and the need to ensure support and safety of elderly and handicapped people with increased health and other risks. Currently there is a lack of graduates having interdisciplinary theoretical education in the fields of electronics and information and communication technologies and simultaneously focusing on the whole complex of practical needs of applications related to assistive technologies. The same situation arises at producers of these technologies. There are very few graduates able to understand and realize complex applications as a whole. Most of the graduates are able to manage separate narrow applications without ability to interconnect them. Therefore we have decided to develop a series of courses that will fill the gap in the education. The courses will become a core of an interdisciplinary study branch in Master study and at the same time they will be offered in life long learning. The core courses cover the following topics: data sensing and transmission; sensors, actuators and control in assistive environment; circuitry and system principles of electronic devices for AT; advanced methods of data mining and knowledge discovery and their applications in AT; telecommunication equipment and systems for AT; multimedia technology; security and safety; system integration; legal, ethical and social aspects of AT. The topics are systematically and logically interconnected. The content is designed in such a way that theory, applications and system integration are represented in suitable proportion.",

abstract="The Asia-Pacific region houses over half of the world's urban population, and is estimated to reach 50{\%} urbanization mark in 2019. Based on their sustained economic growth, Asian-Pacific cities have played a transformative role in the region, and are on the forefront of economic, social, political, and informational and technological change. However, they are also characterized by widespread urban poverty and inequality, enormous deficiencies in access to shelter and services, and deteriorating quality of the urban environment. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) aims to address the main issues faced by cities and human settlements around the world today, and outlines key principles and commitments towards addressing them. First, this chapter contextualises the NUA vis-{\`a}-vis the key sustainable and inclusive urban development issues worldwide. Second, it systematically reviews the idea of governance, and its evolution and theoretical underpinnings since the early 1980s in relation to the changing emphases of overseas development aid. Likewise, it provides insights into the ideas and literature related to governance, decentralization and democratization, and their relevance to cities. Third, the chapter juxtaposes the NUA with the urban realities of the Asia-Pacific region, and reviews three areas of immediate concern: (i) urban governance as an umbrella to respond to urban challenges, (ii) urban planning and policy, and (iii) service delivery and access for social inclusion. In doing so, it highlights the latest tenets of the global urban agenda that are articulated in the NUA, and Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Finally, by providing a brief introduction to the various chapters, it explains how they are organized in the following three sections of the book: (i) urban planning and policy, (ii) innovations in service delivery and access for social inclusion, and (iii) emerging trends and future trajectories.",

abstract="At present the need for interdisciplinary education supporting development and practical application of assistive technologies (AT) is continuously growing. It is given by the development of demographic and age structure of the population and the need to ensure support and safety of elderly and handicapped people with increased health and other risks. Currently there is a lack of graduates having interdisciplinary theoretical education in the fields of electronics and information and communication technologies and simultaneously focusing on the whole complex of practical needs of applications related to assistive technologies. The same situation arises at producers of these technologies. There are very few graduates able to understand and realize complex applications as a whole. Most of the graduates are able to manage separate narrow applications without ability to interconnect them. Therefore we have decided to develop a series of courses that will fill the gap in the education. The courses will become a core of an interdisciplinary study branch in Master study and at the same time they will be offered in life long learning. The core courses cover the following topics: data sensing and transmission; sensors, actuators and control in assistive environment; circuitry and system principles of electronic devices for AT; advanced methods of data mining and knowledge discovery and their applications in AT; telecommunication equipment and systems for AT; multimedia technology; security and safety; system integration; legal, ethical and social aspects of AT. The topics are systematically and logically interconnected. The content is designed in such a way that theory, applications and system integration are represented in suitable proportion.",

In Africa, however, the implementation of this idea has been stubbornly sluggish. This chapter explores the ideology and rationale for learning cities with reference to the idea's rapid evolution during the new millennium and the multitude of practical examples from around the world. The African context is discussed in relation to literature that has so far emerged from the continent. The chapter starts with some reflections on early, but abortive attempts to develop learning cities and regions in southern Africa and some of the reasons why these efforts have apparently not succeeded.

abstract="Due to demographic change and the resulting challenges for society, innovative solutions are needed to maintain the living quality of the elderly. In the research project Ambient Assisted Living in Intelligent Controlled Environments (A2LICE) a (technical) system to maintain the self-determination and autonomy of older people in their home environment is developed. By using facility automation and smart homes, the foundations of assisting people in need for help in their own homes are created. But supporting older people with technical assistance systems is bearing challenges beyond the technical issues. Acceptance problems and the lack of willingness to learn in the main target group lead to problems in the implementation of the ideas. To avoid these problems and demonstrate the advantages of Ambient Assisted Living technologies to the users, methods from other research disciplines are integrated. The approach of Serious Gaming is focusing on using the intrinsic motivation of individuals for learning. This should solve fundamental issues of acceptance and knowledge expansion in older generations. By utilizing the effect of playful learning and by connecting familiar concepts with new ones, users of Ambient Assisted Living technologies are getting easier access to these systems and their operations.",

abstract="One of the most challenging issues faced by many elders is the over-decreasing independence mainly caused by impaired physical, cognitive, and/or sensory abilities. Activity recognition can be used to help elders live longer in their own homes independently, by providing assurance of safety, instructing performance of activity and assessing cognitive status. In this work, we propose to discover both intra- and inter-activity association patterns from daily routines of elderly people. Specifically, a data mining method is proposed to extract the most frequent sequential sequences of steps inside each individual activity (i.e., intra-activity pattern) and activities (i.e., inter-activity pattern) of a set of daily activities. These patterns can then be used to model human daily activities for activity recognition purpose, or to directly instruct/prompt elders with impaired memory when they perform daily routines. The experimental results conducted on two individuals' datasets of daily activities show that our proposed approach is workable to discover these association patterns.",

These prototype systems are categorised based on the styles of their software architecture into a standalone, a multi-agent and two SOA systems. This reflects and closely corresponds to the evolution of the latest technologies in software engineering and smart cyber-physical systems. Given that previous chapters have already described how systems are used for specific use scenarios, this chapter has focused on the implementation details and operation processes of these systems which are described one by one in four sections. It is expected that interested researchers can use these systems or follow the implementation methodologies to support their research. In addition, the performance, strengths and limitations, and future work of these systems are also discussed.",

abstract="In the context of assistive robotics in health care, we introduce the AMIGO system with its innovative ``Coach'' framework that uses social robots for the entertaining motivation of persons with dementiaDementia. The overarching objective is to empower persons with dementiaDementia to perform daily stimulating training activities within the concept of an integrated multimodal intervention. The ``Coach'' frame is complemented by a ``Companion'' frame that involves the client in a long-term relationship with the robot which will care by asking about the client's health status, remind about important events or tasks, involve the client in dialog, invite the client to engage in multimodal training, and provide entertainment such as reading the news from all over the world. A research objective is to adjust Pepper's dialog and motivation style based on emotional feedback sensed in interaction. The system will motivate the client to perform personalized exercises and to maintain and extend social bonds and will stimulate cognitive processes and physical activities. Sensors for eye tracking and motion analysis technologies will offer affordances for entertaining, sensorimotor sequences and for data capture and analysis of cognition and locomotion-specific behavioral parameters. Easily usable interfaces enable planning and autonomous daily practice to formal as well as to the informal caregiver in a weekly rhythm so that people with dementiaDementia can stay at home longer and the progress of dementiaDementia is slowed down. The AMIGO system is motivated from the viewpoint of health care, neuropsychology, and ICT systems. The first implementation of the prototype system and first results of a mixed-method study are presented in detail.",

pages="226--241",
abstract="Targeting at modeling the high-level dynamics of pervasive computing systems, we introduce Bond Computing Systems (BCS) consisting of objects, bonds and rules. Objects are typed but addressless representations of physical or logical (computing and communicating) entities. Bonds are typed multisets of objects. In a BCS, a configuration is specified by a multiset of bonds, called a collection. Rules specifies how a collection evolves to a new one. A BCS is a variation of a P system introduced by Gheorghe Paun where, roughly, there is no maximal parallelism but with typed and unbounded number of membranes, and hence, our model is also biologically inspired. In this paper, we focus on regular bond computing systems (RBCS), where bond types are regular, and study their computation power and verification problems. Among other results, we show that the computing power of RBCS lies between LBA (linearly bounded automata) and LBC (a form of bounded multicounter machines) and hence, the regular bond-type reachability problem (given an RBCS, whether there is some initial collection that can reach some collection containing a bond of a given regular type) is undecidable. We also study some restricted models (namely, B-boundedness and 1-transfer) of RBCS where the reachability problem becomes decidable.",

We applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to build a Behavior Classification Model (BCM) and learn the users' habits when they perform activities for predicting and identifying the house occupant. To test the model, we have analyzed the early morning routine activity of six users at the DOMUS apartment and two users of the publicly available dataset of the Washington State University smart apartment tesbed. The results showed a high prediction precision and demonstrate that each user has his own manner to perform his morning activity, and can be easily identified by just learning his habits.",

abstract="Technology is continually being implemented by construction professionals with the goal of improving construction processes and the industry's glacial pace of change. As we look to new technologies to solve existing problems, we can consider Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to make construction safer and efficient. Through this paper, we explore the ways in which AI can assist in the goal of making construction sites safe. This study proposes the development of an AI platform, which improves construction safety through hazard identification at the pre-construction stage, and suggests the applicable OSHA codes for the identified hazards, thus allowing safety standards to be implemented for compliance. Emphasis is laid on the mitigation of fall hazards, which is the leading cause of accidents in construction. Currently, project safety and risk assessment in the construction industry is carried out by professionals, who heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision making. There is a lack of a systematic approach and the ways to check the reliability of these decisions. Through the machine learning aspect of AI, we can automate the process and create an environment where potential hazards are identified before they occur with a link to the OSHA standards for recommended mitigation strategies.",

abstract="Those with dementia need closer attention and monitoring when they develop incontinence. Incontinence can lead to medical complications such as skin breakdown, places greater demands on caregivers, and strips the patients of their dignity. We have taken a step towards building a smart continence management system (SCMS) by automating the detection of events and forwarding details of these events to caregivers. Besides reducing bedsores and concomitant ill-effects of the elderly remaining in soiled diapers for prolonged periods, SCMS also benefits caregivers, helping them improve visitation schedules and time management. In the user-requirements generation phase, a cohort of people were interviewed. Subsequently the user-requirements were translated into technical specifications, based on which, a product survey was conducted. The system was designed, implemented, deployed and is being evaluated at a nursing home in Singapore. Initial results are encouraging. A planned usability study/overall system evaluation will provide new requirements for the second version.",

abstract="Robotic telepresence offers a means to connect to a remote location via traditional telepresence with the added value of moving and actuating in that location. Recently, there has been a growing focus on the use of robotic telepresence to enhance social interaction among elderly. However for such technology to be accepted it is likely that the experienced presence when using such a system will be important. In this paper, we present results obtained from a training session with a robotic telepresence system when used for the first time by healthcare personnel. The study was quantitative and based on two standard questionnaires used for presence namely, the Temple Presence Inventory (TPI) and the Networked Minds Social Presence Intentory. The study showed that overall the sense of social richness as perceived by the users was high. The users also had a realistic feeling regarding their spatial presence.",

In this scenario, smart homes will significantly help users to increase their quality of life, while maintaining a great level of autonomy. This paper presents a system for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) capable of understanding context and user's behavior by exploiting data gathered by a pervasive sensor network. The knowledge inferred by adopting a Bayesian knowledge extraction approach is exploited to disambiguate the collected observations, making the AAL system able to detect and predict anomalies in user's behavior or health condition, in order to send appropriate alerts to family members and caregivers. Experimental results performed on a simulated smart home prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

Using a Facebook page about Citizens' Observatories (COs), we reviewed indicators for evaluating public interest in social media content, and evaluated users' engagement with our COs page. The result is a practical method to promote and enhance the visibility of environmental health information. The major method is to exploit visual material to increase user engagement. The total sum of visits to the page was greatest when visual content was used. We found that environmental health content appeals to adults between 35--44 years of age, equally balanced between men and women. Our findings highlight the importance of up-to-date informational content, the use of visual content and the role of features for interaction and dialogue to ensure user engagement with a Facebook page on environmental health.",

abstract="Our research group has been studying a speech communication system with a virtual agent (VA), to support person-centered care (PCC) of people with dementia (PWD). The current system uses the 3D model based on an unreal character for the VA. Because the unfamiliar appearance is to be a mental obstacle to PWD, PWD hardly accept advice and which causes a limitation in the care effects. In this paper, we develop a novel system that dynamically creates a VA based on a given facial image of real person. The proposed system constructs a three-dimensional model based on facial landmarks within the image. It then stretches and transforms some portions of the 3D model to generate facial expressions. From just a given picture, the proposed system easily generates a communication agent familiar with individual PWD. Hence, it can implement (virtual, but effective) conversations with familiar partners. We implement the prototype based on the proposed system and conduct the experiment targeting to the elderly.",

By contrast, the logical topology of a network refers to the manner that data flows through the network from one node to the other without worrying about the physical interconnection of the devices for transporting a packet from a source to a destination device. The two lower layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model (ISO/IEC international standard, Information technology -- open systems interconnection -- basic reference model: the basic model, 2nd edn, 1994) , the physical and data link layer, define the physical topology of a network, while the network layer is responsible for the logical topology.",

On one hand Japan is blessed with many ingredients of success. It has a well-developed business culture, is an industrial power with global reach, equipped with a first class bureaucracy and financial strength. To be sure, a highly developed industrial country like Japan needs all of that, especially as it sees itself confronted with unfavourable demographics. The country's population will shrink to less than 100 million in a few decades which will mean a smaller domestic market, less manpower, higher public debt and rising social costs. What to do? As will be sought to explain below, economically, Japan must stay on the higher edge of the `Smiley's curve' and focus on products and services with the highest possible added value. Japan is equipped with the instruments, manpower and know-how to do all of that although we should always keep in mind that ``history is sometimes the result of mistakes'' as the saying goes.",

This preliminary analysis has interested the extraction of features from Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA) signal and their correlation with different emotional states (i.e., Arousal). A low-cost system for continuous monitoring of EDA has been described, together with the experimental setup and the processing techniques applied. A unique indicator, which combines the features extracted from the raw waveform, has been discussed in the paper and applied in post-processing. The implementation of the processing algorithms and the computation of the novel indicator allow to discriminate, with a statistical significance, the user perception, in case of high emotion events (i.e., from low level Arousal{\thinspace}{\thinspace}6). More investigation is needed to improve the processing technique and validate the preliminary results obtained.",

abstract="Today there is no internationally accepted standard that establishes rules for designing a circadian lighting system for interior spaces. For several years, in many different contexts, we have been talking about human centric lighting, although both the definition and the practical application of this discipline are controversial and debated. In this concluding chapter, through the analysis of the original research results presented in this book and of other sectoral research, we propose a framework of possible guidelines for circadian lighting. The elements that come into play in this framework are the natural light present in interior spaces, but also lighting design and lighting product design achievable currently thanks to the availability of LED light sources and the new lighting management systems.",

abstract="One of the effects of population ageing is the increase in the proportion of long-term chronic diseases, which require new therapeutical models that mostly take place at the patients' home rather than inside a health care institution. This requires that patients autonomously follow their prescribed treatment, which can be especially difficult for patients suffering some kind of cognitive impairment. Information technologies show potential for supporting medication adherence but the main challenge is the distributed and highly regulated nature of this scenario, where there are several tasks involving the coordinated action of a range of actors. In this paper we propose to use socially intelligent systems to tackle this challenge. These systems exhibit, understand, and reason about social behaviour, in order to support people in their daily lives. Such systems present an opportunity when applied to information technologies for supporting treatment adherence. We explore how concepts of socially intelligent systems, including social practices and social identities, can be applied to AVICENA, an ongoing project to create a platform for assisting patients in several daily tasks related to their healthcare. We first introduce AVICENA, briefly describe our previous attempts to model the system from an organizational perspective and an institutional one and discuss some of the limitations found in those models. Then the core concepts of socially intelligent systems are introduced and we show how they can be applied to create a socially aware framework for supporting medication adherence.",

abstract="In recent years, the research on the anomaly detection has been rapidly increasing. The researchers were worked on different anomalies in videos. This work focuses on fall as an anomaly as it is an emerging research topic with application in elderly safety areas including home environment. The older population staying alone at home is prone to various accidental events including falls which may lead to multiple harmful consequences even death. Thus, it is imperative to develop a robust solution to avoid this problem. This can be done with the help of video surveillance along with computer vision. In this paper, a simple yet efficient technique to detect fall with the help of inexpensive depth camera was presented. Frame differencing method was applied for background subtraction. Various features including orientation angle, aspect ratio, silhouette features, and motion history image (MHI) were extracted for fall characterization. The training and testing were successfully implemented using SVM and SGD classifiers. It was observed that SGD classifier gives better fall detection accuracy than the SVM classifier in both training and testing phase for SDU fall dataset.",

abstract="The ReAAL project intends to deploy a critical mass of Ambient Assisted Living applications and services for ca. 7,000 users in seven EU countries, based upon the universAAL platform, previously developed with EC support, with the intent of kick-starting the market for interoperable AAL services, applications and devices. ReAAL will facilitate the emergence of an AAL ecosystem by showing the platform usefulness, and spreading the related technical knowledge through an associated community of interest. Here, ReAAL will establish a multi-dimension evaluation methodology to measure the impact of the deployment of the AAL ecosystem in terms of the social, economic and health indicators. Whether health, safety, comfort, social integration or support of mobility---assistance might be needed in any possible aspect of daily life. From an investment point of view, the AAL market should allow individuals in danger of losing independence to pick the set of applications and services of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) over time in conjunction with actual needs, as they arise. Open platforms are supposed to be the enabler for such gradual system evolution and support products and services to become more affordable, future-proof, adaptable, and accessible. The ReAAL project investigates these assumptions via a number of pilots, each with a different focus. If the platform's usefulness can be shown and the related technical knowledge is spread to an associated community of interest, a self-organizing AAL ecosystem will emerge, from which diverse stakeholders will benefit: application and technology vendors, service providers, public authorities and policy makers, sponsors, and the consumer masses, foremost those people who wish to be able to avoid dependency on nursing homes, preferring to continue to live independently in their own homes.",

abstract="Over the last decade a number of technologies have been developed that support individuals in keeping themselves active. This can be done via e-coaching mechanisms and by installing more advanced technologies in their homes. The objective of the Active Healthy Ageing (AHA) Platform is to integrate existing tools, hardware, and software that assist individuals in improving and/or maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This architecture is realized by integrating several hardware/software components that generate various types of data. Some examples include heart-rate data, coaching information, in-home activity patterns, mobility patterns, and so on. Various subsystems in the AHA platform can share their data in a semantic and interoperable way, through the use of a AHA data-store and a wearable devices ontology. This paper presents such an ontology for wearable data interoperability in Ambient Assisted Living environments. The ontology includes concepts such as height, weight, locations, activities, activity levels, activity energy expenditure, heart rate, or stress levels, among others. The purpose is serving application development in Ambient Intelligence scenarios ranging from activity monitoring and smart homes to active healthy ageing or lifestyle profiling.",

abstract="In this study, we evaluate the use of height for biometric identification of residents, by mounting ultrasonic distance sensors above the doorways in a home. Height sensors are cheap, are convenient for the residents, are simple to install in an existing home, and are perceived to be less invasive than cameras or microphones. Height is typically only a weak biometric, but we show that it is well suited for identifying among a few residents in the home, and can potentially be improved by using the history of height measurements at multiple doorways in a tracking approach. We evaluate this approach using 20 people in a controlled laboratory environment and by installing in 3 natural, home environments. We combine these results with public anthropometric data sets that contain the heights of residents in 2077 elderly multi-resident homes to conclude that height sensors could potentially achieve at least 95{\%} identification accuracy in 95{\%} of elderly homes in the US.",

abstract="The demographic change has tremendous consequences for health care availability, with a growing mismatch between rising numbers of patients and the declining number of care personnel. As a consequence, considerable shortcomings in availability, accessibility, and quality of health care can be expected. Telemedicine and telemonitoring services are promising approaches to compensate this gap, especially for long-term monitoring, nevertheless also within the supply chain of health care. Despite the potential, the acceptance of telemedicine is quite low. In this paper we report on two studies focusing on acceptance of telemedical services. First, chronically ill persons were experimentally studied with respect to their acceptance of telemedical systems. Second, a survey was conducted to assess medical professionals' points of view. Findings reveal perceived benefits in the context of telemedical services, however, also considerable barriers, especially on the medical doctors' side. Outcomes may contribute to the development of a sensitive and transparent communication and information strategy for stakeholders, as well as a public awareness for the benefits and the drawbacks of telemedical services.",

The Climate Adapted People Shelters (CAPS) project addressed the complex challenges of public exposure to urban heat, its impacts on the community, and the need for smarter public transport infrastructure to improve the liveability of cities in a warming world. It found that solutions to this problem require the integration of knowledge that includes, but is not limited to, the disciplines of environmental physics, innovation and design, business management, smart technology design, transport user behaviour and local governance. The project sought to foster innovation in climate adaptation through an open and human-centred design competition involving multiple stakeholders. The process was important because it revealed that community expectations about bus shelter design and performance were multi-faceted, and that the needs of infrastructure users could inform the practices of designing future public infrastructure. We discuss how to achieve more effective and broadly accepted urban design by utilizing open innovation, addressing urban resilience and climate adaptation, and leveraging the opportunities that lie within the use of data analytics and sensor technologies to address, in particular, transport user needs.",

As technology is becoming ubiquitous in healthcare, self-management of one's health typically requires the patient to interact with a variety of technologies. These changes in the healthcare system are coupled with a rapid aging of the US population, resulting in a greater need for technologies to assist older adults in managing their health. However, age-related declines in cognitive abilities can impact the success with which older adults are able to use healthcare technologies. To be useful to and useable by older adults, technology must be compatible with the needs, preferences, and abilities of diverse older adult populations. This chapter provides an overview of aging, cognition, and technology systems, with a focus on the implications for use of healthcare technology and the capability of technology to support cognitive aging. We also discuss factors that influence the adoption of technology among older adults and provide a case study on the interdisciplinary collaboration necessary for successful technology development.",

The robot interacted with the two participants for almost one hour. A tremendous amount of sensory data was recorded from the multi-sensory system (i.e., audio data, RGB-D data, thermal images, and the data from the skeleton tracker) for better understanding the interaction, the needs, the reactions of the users, and the context. This data was processed offline. Before the interaction between the two elderly residents and the robot, a demo was shown to all the residents of the facility. The reactions of the residents were positive and they found the robot useful. The first lessons learnt from this interaction between Kompa{\"i} robot and the elderly are reported.",

Probably among the most challenging members of the home network are the elderly, who may have demanding needs for ensuring accessibility. Either living in a joined community as in a home for the elderly or at home on their own, the possibility to have a remote connection to the homes of their extended family may become important by e.g. decreasing mobility. Interconnectivity between various heterogeneous networks across multiple homes means for example situations where the family shares a photo album or web server with various pieces located at different homes. In this paper, we identify usability challenges presented by internetworking multiple homes, with a special focus on universal accessibility.",

abstract="The urban centers in India are experiencing a rapid transformation, both controlled and uncontrolled, supported by the growing economy in the past two decades. However, this rapid urban growth has led to failure of urban authorities to regulate and implement safe building standards and practices, resulting in risk accumulation in the urban centers. Building regulation is an important tool to address the problems of uncontrolled development and increasing disaster risk. In spite of existence of various codes and guidelines (BIS codes, NDMA guidelines, and PWD/CPWD manuals), nothing has proved accountable enough to scale down the magnitude of the vulnerabilities of building stocks. In India, state governments, local bodies (urban and rural), development authorities, special and new town development agencies, etc. are directed to modify, revise, and revamp the existing building regulations, planning, and safety standards in line with the National Building Code (NBC) 2015 with due consideration for the local variations. But implementation has remained a challenge due to weak institutional and financial capacities of the urban local bodies and non-emergence of specified agencies/expertise in the country. The strengthening and capacity building of various building development and regulating agencies with adequate level of expertise for proactive responses need to be supported by the building professionals and builder's lobby. This chapter highlights the importance of compliance of built structure with national guidelines/standards/codes/manuals developed in the country. Further the chapter highlights various gaps based on four factors: (1) legal mechanism, (2) building code development, (3) implementation, and (4) training and awareness. In order to narrow the gaps, possible solutions like expert pooling among contiguously situated urban local bodies, rapid visual surveys, and financial incentives are discussed in the later part of the chapter.",

China and India share many similarities: both have a huge population, high economic growth, and ancient civilizations (which provide them with strong national identities) with-out histories of colonizing others. Yet, both are distinct in terms of their political and economic structure and progress. Since opening up in 1978, China has developed into a nation with a larger and wealthier population than India, with the per capita income of an average Chinese citizen being three times that of an average Indian.1 While China is considered ``The Factory of the World'' because of its reputation for exporting low-cost manufactured goods and merchandise, India is a global center for services, specifically, a hub for outsourcing business work processes and software.

abstract="The demographic change has tremendous consequences for health care availability, with a growing mismatch between rising numbers of patients and the declining number of care personnel. As a consequence, considerable shortcomings in availability, accessibility, and quality of health care can be expected. Telemedicine and telemonitoring services are promising approaches to compensate this gap, especially for long-term monitoring, nevertheless also within the supply chain of health care. Despite the potential, the acceptance of telemedicine is quite low. In this paper we report on two studies focusing on acceptance of telemedical services. First, chronically ill persons were experimentally studied with respect to their acceptance of telemedical systems. Second, a survey was conducted to assess medical professionals' points of view. Findings reveal perceived benefits in the context of telemedical services, however, also considerable barriers, especially on the medical doctors' side. Outcomes may contribute to the development of a sensitive and transparent communication and information strategy for stakeholders, as well as a public awareness for the benefits and the drawbacks of telemedical services.",

abstract="In today's healthcare environment, patients are increasingly expected to assume more responsibility in managing their health. As technology is becoming ubiquitous in healthcare, self-management of one's health typically requires the patient to interact with a variety of technologies. These changes in the healthcare system are coupled with a rapid aging of the US population, resulting in a greater need for technologies to assist older adults in managing their health. However, age-related declines in cognitive abilities can impact the success with which older adults are able to use healthcare technologies. To be useful to and useable by older adults, technology must be compatible with the needs, preferences, and abilities of diverse older adult populations. This chapter provides an overview of aging, cognition, and technology systems, with a focus on the implications for use of healthcare technology and the capability of technology to support cognitive aging. We also discuss factors that influence the adoption of technology among older adults and provide a case study on the interdisciplinary collaboration necessary for successful technology development.",

DR mechanisms are capable of controlling the user energy consumption according to load conditions and providing effective energy management. However, they are typically performed regardless of user's situation and current activities. Factoring in the user's contextual information which is relevant to their current or future energy consumption can significantly increase the effectiveness of DR programs and enable adaptive and personalized execution of DR control actions. In this paper, we review current DR techniques and discuss the state-of-the-art smart energy management approaches that take into account contextual information. An overview of context reasoning and learning techniques for smart homes are presented to demonstrate how knowledge of user activities can be utilized in context-aware DR mechanisms. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of DR programs and highlight the importance of the context-awareness in improving smart energy management.",

People adapt to smart devices and let discipline them. People trust in smart devices for numerous, albeit vague reasons.

abstract="Technology is becoming a common place in the lives of all of us, the potential for it to help deliver health and social care is exciting. However, the full potential of this won't be recognised if there is a failure to understand how such technology is interwoven within our daily lives. It must be remembered not everyone can interact with technology in the same way. Yet technology is often developed around the lives of the imagined average citizen, meaning many people can be disadvantaged by not having technology fit their into lives. Systems are still designed to help others in a rather paternalistic fashion. Therefore more needs to be done to involve the end users of the technology in the design of technology such as mobile ehealth (mhealth) and move towards a bottom up transcendent rather than technocratic approach to technology. In addition, there should be more space for understanding how technology, such as mhealth, can change society, examining how it challenges moral dilemmas and ethics. Regulation is important when developing new technology, but it needs to cover changes in practice not just the technology itself. Mobile ehealth also effects many current debates in the lives of older people and those in marginalised groups of society, including challenging systems of health and social care but also housing, transport and economics. More research is needed in the area of mhealth but the research must continue to be multi-disciplinary and fully involve stakeholders and end-users for full potential to be realised.",

abstract="The availability of diverse embedded sensors in modern smartphones has created exciting opportunities for developing context-aware services and applications, such as Human activity recognition (HAR) in healthcare and smart buildings. However, recognizing human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data mining approaches due to the limited resources of the device. For example, the training process is usually performed offline but rarely online on the mobile device itself, because traditional batch learning usually needs a large dataset of many users. Therefore, building models using complex multiclass algorithms is generally very time-consuming. In this paper, we present a comparison study using two approaches in order to reduce training time and memory usage while maintaining significant performance. In the first approach, we conducted experiments using batch learning on a GPU platform. Results showed that High Performance Extreme Learning Machine (HPELM) offers the best compromise: accuracy, memory usage and training time. Moreover, it achieved better performance on two dynamic activities, outperforming the best SVM model obtained in our previous study. In the second approach, we conducted experiments using online stream learning on the MOA platform. Unlike the first approach, experiments were performed using accelerometer data only. We also studied the effects of user/device dependency and feature engineering on the classification performance and memory usage by comparing five constructed real data streams. Simulation results showed that Hoeffding Adaptive Tree has comparable performance to batch learning, especially for user and device dependent data streams.",

abstract="Falls are a major risk for the elderly and where immediate help is needed. The elderly, especially when suffering from dementia, are not able to react to emergency situations properly, thus falls need to be detected automatically. An overview of different classes of fall detection approaches is presented and a vision-based approach is introduced. We propose the use of a Kinect to obtain 3D data in combination with fuzzy logic for robust fall detection and show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms. Our approach is evaluated on 72 video sequences, containing 40 falls and 32 activities of daily living.",

abstract="Wireless sensor devices with communication capabilities are affected by data quality issues. To ensure that information transmitted by these sensing devices are of a high quality, the data needs to be processed, validated and verified to meet the data quality requirements of the end user. The sensor validation component of the Data Management System (DMS) architecture is presented. It is designed to identify if the real-time sensor is functioning within the correct operating bounds. The DMS is applied within a medical environment to assess its ability to manage real-time patient sensor readings. The effectiveness of the DMS-Validation Model (DMS-VM) is evaluated under two real world scenarios 1) Hardware variance among four Tyndall-DMS-Motes with a patient state of resting and 2) One Tyndall-DMS-Mote under three patient states. The experiments have shown the reliability of the Tyndall-DMS-Mote and the ability of the DMS-VM to ensure sensor data quality. Validating sensor reliability is essential to enable safe remote health monitoring in the home.",

abstract="One application of smart homes is to take sensor activations from a variety of sensors around the house and use them to recognise the particular behaviours of the inhabitants. This can be useful for monitoring of the elderly or cognitively impaired, amongst other applications. Since the behaviours themselves are not directly observed, only the observations by sensors, it is common to build a probabilistic model of how behaviours arise from these observations, for example in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In this paper we present a method of selecting which of a set of trained HMMs best matches the current observations, together with experiments showing that it can reliably detect and segment the sensor stream into behaviours. We demonstrate our algorithm on real sensor data obtained from the MIT PlaceLab. The results show a significant improvement in the recognition accuracy over other approaches.",

abstract="We discuss an integrated approach towards building systems for monitoring and assisting people with mild dementia in their homes. Our approach differs from existing approaches in three ways. First we improve context acquisition and understanding with the concept of micro-context that takes us beyond existing notions of location and temporal context; second, we incorporate plasticity concept into the human computer interface, in order to provide a natural interaction way and accommodative interface to the user; third we target robust and reliable systems that are easy to scale and deploy in diverse end-user settings, through the use of formal model building tools to specify and verify systems at key stages from requirements generation all the way to deployment and user statistics gathering. In order to address real-life end user requirements we are working closely with geriatric doctors and their staff, so as to get inputs as to precise challenges in caring for mild dementia patients, and how systems targeted at holistic, personalized assistance and care-giving can be built with a view towards scaled up deployment in diverse settings. The main contribution of this paper is an approach for system building that incorporates activity monitoring, user interface plasticity and scenario verification targeting people with cognitive decline in regards to a Singapore initiative called A-Star Home 2015 Phase II. We expect our work to lead to a methodology for systematic development of monitoring and assistive systems for cognitive interventions for mild dementia patients at home. Although the integrated framework is still not completely realized, the three areas mentioned above have each yielded significant results on their own, and these are mentioned in the paper.",

ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, has published an ETSI Guide (EG) [1] that anticipates new interaction technologies [2] in the form of technology roadmaps, pointing out potential barriers individual technologies may create for specific user groups. That document also lists measures that can be taken in order to overcome these barriers so that the technologies can be introduced to the market in barrier-free versions right from their first implementation.

abstract="While worldwide several health and wellbeing products and services are being developed to support people to live comfortable and independently in their home environment, widespread adoption of these smart living solutions is still not envisioned. A hindering factor is that users are not aware of possible solutions or where to find them, which could be solved through promoting solutions on shared platforms. Designing such platforms is challenging as multiple stakeholders need to be satisfied and start-up problems need to be overcome. Most theory on platforms is explored in ex-post studies and there is a lack of knowledge on how platforms should be designed and implemented. In this paper, we elicit functional requirements for the design of a multi-sided health and wellbeing platform based on interviews with both end-users and stakeholders. These requirements provide the basis for future design cycles in which, the development and actual implementation of a platform is foreseen.",

In this sense, the integration of hospital and homecare protocols and technologies should be considered from the moment that they begin to be designed. The proliferation of healthcare units and services complicates this task, as multiple administrative domains can be found, usually spread out in multiple technology domains, difficult to integrate. This hard integration requires a well defined middleware where heterogeneous and autonomous components must be included. The design of this middleware observing well accepted international standards is a cornerstone for the successful deployment. This chapter makes a review of the concept of personalized medicine, the main research trends in hospital and homecare and it finally proposes some approaches to design architectures providing healthcare scenarios and knowledge integration.",

Significant outcomes have been achieved in developing an integrated health informatics framework for long term monitoring of an elderly person living independently. The wireless sensing systems were indigenously designed and developed at the Smart Sensing and Intelligent System research group of Massey University, New Zealand. Novel artificial intelligent methods have been devised to determine the wellness of an elderly person living alone. The deployed sensor systems at the home of an elderly person do not require any direct contact with the inhabitant. The ubiquitous computing environment allows the elderly person to stay as they normally do while providing the monitoring system to be able to recognize their daily activities, and assess and determine the behavior of the elderly person as regular or not.",

The role of public health professionals is to merge health expertise with non-medical expertise making public-health action possible and achievable. The process of changing is faster than predicted. There is no unique recipe for different urban areas and human agglomeration. In this paper, we give our common views from different perspectives (Belgium and Serbia). Exchanges of different experiences and stories about challenges support a way to common sustainable future.",

Such spaces are defined as a physical space rich in equipment and software services that is capable of interacting with people in order to provide intelligent services to the user for improved comfort (quality of life), energy saving, security, and tremendous benefits for an elderly person living alone. Providing intelligent services requires the equipment to be sensitive to the context of use or context-awareness. The concept of context is a key enabling factor in such environment and understand it, establishing its components and modeling it are basic and important steps for the development of smart spaces.

The search process for mobile AT applications that fulfill specific user needs is not an easy task for the end-users, their facilitators as well as the professionals in the area of rehabilitation. Even, when they finally find what they are looking for, a number of questions are raised relative to the reliability, stability, compatibility and functionality of the AT applications. These questions can be answered safely only by a team of AT experts. In this work we present the methodological approach for the design and development of the mATHENA web-based inventory, which aims to make the search and selection of free mobile AT applications simple and sound. This methodology is based on the consistent and well-documented presentation of the information for each mobile AT application, after it is tested in an AT lab. mATHENA offers social interaction services for its diverse target groups. Moreover, we present the advantages of mATHENA compared with the functionalities of six other inventories for AT applications.

Even though some historical concepts of the early twentieth century like Garden City and the Charter of Athens are still influencing the structure and patterns of the ancient European town, extensive demographic and economic transformations are the main present drivers of their developments. Due to these drivers, different forms of suburbanization and urban sprawl as well as metropolization and regionalization characterize the current urban development on a global scale. Besides this, functional and structural diversifications and future challenges of urban planning will especially result from climate change, more participatory oriented forms of governance and new paradigms for a post oil society in general.",

abstract="Pervasive sensors in the home have a variety of applications including energy minimization, activity monitoring for elders, and tutors for household tasks such as cooking. Many of the common sensors today are binary, e.g. IR motion sensors, door close sensors, and floor pressure pads. Predicting user behavior is one of the key enablers for applications. While we consider smart home data here, the general problem is one of predicting discrete human actions. Drawing on Activity Theory, the language as action principle, and speech understanding research, we argue that smoothed n-grams are very appropriate for this task. We built such a model and applied it to data gathered from 3 smart home installations. The data showed a classic Zipf or power-law distribution, similar to speech and language. We found that the predictive accuracy of the n-gram model ranges from 51{\%} to 39{\%}, which is significantly above the baseline for the deployments of 16, 76 and 70 sensors. While we cannot directly compare this result with other work (lack of shared data), by examination of high entropy zones in the datasets (e.g. the kitchen triangle) we argue that accuracies around 50{\%} are best possible for this task.",

abstract="Daily activity recognition is essential to enable smart elderly care services and the recognition accuracy affects much the quality of the elderly care system. Although a lot of work has been done to recognize elderly people's activities of daily life (ADL), few systems have investigated if the location information can be deployed to improve the ADL recognition accuracy. In this paper, we intend to incorporate the location information in the activity recognition algorithm and see if it can help to improve the recognition accuracy. We propose two ways to bring the location information into the picture: one way is to bring location in the feature level, the other way is to utilize it to filter irrelevant sensor readings. Intensive experiments have been conducted to show that bringing location information into the activity recognition algorithm in both ways can help to improve the recognition rate by around 5{\%} on average compared to the system neglecting the location information.",

Among the target groups of people, elderly are a population eager for ``choices for living arrangements'', which would allow them to continue living in their homes but at the same time provide the health care they need. Given the growing elderly population, there is a need for statistical models able to capture the recurring patterns of daily activity life and reason based on this information. We present an analysis of real-life sensor data collected from 40 different households of elderly people, using motion, door and pressure sensors. Our objective is to automatically observe and model the daily behavior of the elderly and detect anomalies that could occur in the sensor data. For this purpose, we first introduce an abstraction layer to create a common ground for home sensor configurations. Next, we build a probabilistic spatio-temporal model to summarize daily behavior. Anomalies are then defined as significant changes from the learned behavioral model and detected using a cross-entropy measure. We have compared the detected anomalies with manually collected annotations and the results show that the presented approach is able to detect significant behavioral changes of the elderly.",

abstract="More and more people in china are increasingly using Internet as a major source of health-related information in recent years. Online healthcare communities (OHCs) are interesting in this regard, appearing to serve as virtual communities for people to provide social support. However, the development of OHCs requires the active participation of its members to create and share knowledge. How to improve community members' provision of social support becomes a key issue for community managers. To address this issue, utilizing social exchange theory, we propose a benefit-cost model to study the incentive factors and inhibiting factors of the social support in OHCs. In the model, the benefits are extended to the psychological rewards in social exchange, including sense of belongings, reputation and sense of self-worth. Costs are divided into cognitive costs and executional costs. We study the moderation effect of psychological distance. Data will be collected from more than 300 users of well-known OHCs in China and analyzed by SmartPLS. The research findings can provide managerial implications for community managers.",

abstract="The improvement of the conditions of daily life at home and work, promoted by the socio-economic progression, best quality private living environments and the immense development in healthcare and biomedical technologies has extended the average age of life beyond 70. According to recent surveys this ``population aging'' phenomenon will contribute to reach the record number of 1 billion people over 60 years on earth by the year 2020. Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents a remote home monitoring application called Living Assistant that could be utilized to continuously monitor and control a wide range of electronic appliances and ambient parameters. Basically it has been designed to function as a healthcare aide for elderly patients suffering from restricted mobility or other chronic diseases. The advanced ways of user interfaces presented in this paper are simple, generic and universally applicable.

abstract="Activity- and context-aware systems, as they are known, established, and well evaluated in small-scale laboratory settings for years and decades, suffer from the fact, that they are limited concerning the underlying data delivering entities. The sensor systems are usually attached on the body, on objects, or in the environment, directly surrounding persons or groups whose activities or contextual information has to be detected. For sensors that are exploited in this kind of systems, it is essential that their modalities, positions and technical details are initially defined to ensure a stable and accurate system execution. In contrast to that, opportunistic sensing allows for selecting and utilizing sensors, as they happen to be accessible according to their spontaneous availability, without presumably defining the input modalities, on a goal-oriented principle. One major benefit thereby is the capability of utilizing sensors of different kinds and modalities, even immaterial sources of information like webservices, by abstracting low-level access details. This emerges the need to roll out the data federating entity as decentralized collecting point. Cloud-based technologies enable space- and time-free utilization of a vast amount of heterogeneous sensor devices reaching from simple physical devices (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, as they are conventionally included on today's smart phones) to social media sensors, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This paper presents an opportunistic, cloud-based approach for large-scale activity- and context-recognition.",

abstract="Societies need to devise mechanisms of caring for the well aging of the increasing number of seniors, as it is very important for elderly people to maintain their independence. Smart environments are being devised as a form of care in what has been called ambient assisted living. A smart environment should be able to respond in case of emergency or risk and inform any abnormal behavior. Still, not much research is done to understand behavior patterns, temporal changes and other particularities that can affect the effectiveness of smart environments in ambient assisted living. We explored the behavior of two adults in a smart environment in order to reveal temporal, spatial and sequential relations among the activities as well as the changes that these relations undergo overtime and across individuals. This paper presents an analysis of three human behavior patterns: temporal, location and frequency. These patterns are mined on two experimental subjects using the dataset provided by the CASAS project.",

In particular the combination of smart home environments and relatively inexpensive robots can be a viable technological solutions for assisting elderly and persons with disability in their own home. Such services require an easy interface like spoken dialogue and the ability to refer to physical objects using semantic terms. This paper presents an implemented system combining a robot and a sensor network deployed in a test apartment in an elderly residence area. The paper focuses on the creation and maintenance (anchoring) of the connection between the semantic information present in the dialogue with perceived physical objects in the home. Semantic knowledge about concepts and their correlations are retrieved from on-line resources and ontologies, e.g. WordNet, and sensor information is provided by cameras distributed in the apartment.",

abstract="User guidance systems are relevant to various applications of the service robotics field, among which: smart GPS navigator, robotic guides for museum or shopping malls or robotic wheel chairs for disabled persons. Such a system aims at helping its user to reach its destination in a fairly complex environment. If we assume the system is used in a fixed environment by multiple users for multiple navigation task over the course of days or weeks, then it is possible to take advantage of the user routine: from the initial navigational choice, users can be identified and their goal can be predicted. As a result of these prediction, the guidance system can bring its user to its destination while requiring less interaction. This property is particularly relevant for assisting disabled person for whom interaction is a long and complex task. In this paper, we implement a user guidance system using a dynamic Bayesian model and a topological representation of the environment. This model is evaluated with respect to the quality of its action prediction in a scenario involving 4 human users, and it is shown that in addition to the user identity, the goals and actions of the user are accurately predicted.",

abstract="Elderly with declining cognitive functions, their family members and assistive care providers have all identified good ``quality of life'' as a central element in living with diseases such as dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Quality of life concerns mood, sleep, daily activities performance, pleasant engagements, physical mobility and healthy lifestyle. Sleep quality is essential for the human being to maintain good physical and emotional health. And sleep disorders can lead to severe physical and emotional effects, e.g. cognitive decline and mental health complications. So being able to measure and evaluate sleep quality and monitor mood is inseparably linked to every assistive living system. Sensor-based sleep and mood monitoring systems promise to prolong independent living of elderly people with declining physical and cognitive functions. In this paper, an implementation of sleep and mood monitoring and estimation of intelligent modules part of Ambient Assisted Living architecture is presented. A web application displays the computational results by providing information and recommendations on how to improve sleep hygiene to caregivers and coaches the elderly into a healthy sleeping behavior, based on their personal rhythm and health problems.",

abstract="Although eHealth technologies offer an enormous potential to improve healthcare, the knowledge about key determinants of acceptance for eHealth technology is restricted. While the underlying technology of eHealth technologies and Information and Communication technology (ICT) is quite similar, utilization contexts and using motives are quite different. In order to explore the role of technology type on acceptance, we contrasted central application characteristics of both technology types using the scenario technique. A questionnaire was administered (n = 104) measuring individual variables (age, gender) and attitudes regarding an eHealth application (blood sugar meter) in contrast to an ICT device (Personal Digital Assistant, PDA). Older users basically approved the utilization of health-related technologies and perceived lower usability barriers. In addition, we identified main utilization motives of eHealth technology and technology-specific acceptance patterns, especially regarding issues of data safety in the eHealth context. Effects of age and gender in acceptance ratings suggest a differential perspective on eHealth acceptance. Finally, practical interventions were derived in order to support eHealth device design and to promote acceptance of eHealth technology.",

abstract="This paper investigates the multiple dimensions of patient satisfaction measured by the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey in the United States. The analysis reveals that even the highest rating hospitals do not excel on all dimensions of satisfaction. While satisfaction levels with nurse and doctor communication are high, satisfaction levels with discharge information and explanation of medications could be significantly improved. In addition, low rating hospitals seem to be doing better than the high rating hospitals on these critical dimensions for the quality of care. The paper also investigates how hospital structural characteristics captured in the American Hospital Association (AHA) survey affect different dimensions of patient satisfaction. The analysis reveals that these structural factors may have differential effects, i.e. the type of hospitals (e.g., teaching vs. non-teaching) has a relatively small effect on the hospital room environment than on communication and responsiveness. The results suggest that considering all patient satisfaction dimensions helps provide a more accurate picture of the care received by patients, makes it possible to pinpoint specific areas where hospitals are deficient that are not reflected in the overall satisfaction scores, and assists hospital management to design actionable strategies for improvement.",

abstract="Combining ongoing Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technological developments (e.g. pervasive computing, wearable devices, sensor networks etc.) with user-centred design methods greatly increases the acceptance of the intelligent system and makes it more capable of providing a better quality of life in a non-intrusive way. Elderly people could clearly benefit from this concept. Thanks to smart environments, they can experience considerable enhancements, giving them an opportunity to live more independently and for longer in their home rather than in a health-care centre. However, to implement such a system, it is essential to know for whom we are designing. In this paper, we present an intelligent system with a monitoring infrastructure that will help mainly elderly users with impairments to overcome their handicap. The purpose of such a system is to create a safe and intuitive environment that will facilitate the achievement of household tasks in order to preserve independence of elderly residents for a while longer. Pursuing this goal, we propose to use the persona concept to help us build a user model based on the personas' aptitudes. The practice of user modelling emphasizes the importance of user-centred techniques in any AmI system development and highlights the potential impacts of AmI for certain targeted groups - in this case, the elderly and people with disabilities.",

abstract="This study conducted a driving simulation experiment using an aural, visual, or multi-modality in-vehicle information system (IVIS) to investigate the performance and emergency response of 24 younger (age: M = 23.10 years, SD = 1.54) and 24 older (age: M = 69.21 years, SD = 3.05) drivers in simple and complex road conditions. All drivers assisted by aural or multi-modality IVIS made significantly fewer errors in response to hazard warnings than those who were assisted by the visual modality system. Specifically, drivers exhibited improved performance for response time and the total number of correct turns in complex driving conditions when using multi- or aural modality IVIS; this effect is particularly salient for older drivers. The IVIS improved the safety of older drivers more than that of their younger counterparts, despite their poor vehicle control and slow response time in hazard situations.",

abstract="Today, data collected in smart-living environments are constantly increasing in the dimensions of volume, velocity and variety, which characterize any big data application. In such a way, it makes sense to investigate big data analytics for elderly monitoring at home. The aim of this study is to conduct a preliminary investigation of state-of-the-art algorithms for abnormal activity detection and change prediction, suitable to deal with big data. The algorithmic approaches, under evaluation and comparison, belong to the three main categories of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques. At this purpose, specific synthetic data are generated, including activities of daily living, home locations in which such activities take place, as well as physiological parameters. All techniques are evaluated in terms of abnormality-detection accuracy and lead-time of prediction, using the generated datasets with various kinds of perturbation. The achieved results, even though preliminary, are very encouraging, showing that unsupervised deep-learning techniques outperform traditional (machine learning) ones, with detection accuracy greater than 96{\%} and prediction lead-time of about 15 days in advance.",

Hence, it is crucial for patient's health data to be digitalized and organized in such a way allowing their exploitation by the healthcare provider at a later point of time [2].

abstract="Service-Oriented Architecture is widely used to program pervasive spaces such as Smart Homes because of its capabilities to handle dynamic and heterogeneous environments. It is often the case that the services required are designed and implemented using different SOAs, such as OSGi and Web Services. Most of the current composition frameworks take a two-tier approach: those services following the same SOA can take advantage of service composition and runtime substitutions, while interactions between services of different SOAs require hardcoded service invocations that do not really provide full advantage of SOA. Some SOAs do not support features such as on-the-fly compositions or a searchable service directory. In this paper, we present a framework to compose and orchestrate services from different SOA implementations and provide the missing functionalities to support composition of heterogeneous SOAs. We present a case study and the performance analysis of the study to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework.",

abstract="Studies on contemporary urbanization have put a lot of emphasis on the conditions of the slums which presently are almost universal phenomenon in the developed and the developing countries alike. But the magnitude and the nature of the problems suffered by these spatial units vary regionally depending on the skewed behaviour of the combination of socio-economic and demographic variables. Slums, often referred to as the urban blight, suffer from insufficiency of infrastructures and civic amenities, filth and dingy ambience and the health hazards of the residents are directly related to such stressful environment and living conditions. The living conditions on the other hand is greatly reflected in the type of the dwelling unit, the density of the occupance, the availability of proper ventilations to name a few and the socio-economic status of the occupant on the other. However, it is also true that the conditions in the slums cannot be straight-jacketed as studies have revealed a great deal of variations in the so called homogenous urban space. Therefore, the present study attempts to assess the housing and housing conditions in the slums of Delhi and would proceed to measure whether the choice of such dwelling units has any causal relationship with the various socio-economic and the demographic variables. Furthermore, attempt has also been made to congregate the findings on the basis of the regional variations the conditions of living of the slum dwellers. For the purpose of the study 13 slums well distributed geographically had been selected in Delhi.",

abstract="Assisted Living Systems with Ambient Intelligence technology raise new challenges to system and software engineering. The development of Assisted Living applications requires domain-oriented interdisciplinary research -- it is essential to know both the domain and the context. It is also important that context-descriptive prototypes are: (1) an integrated description that describes system, work processes, context of use; and (2) a formal description. Because (1), designers, including end users, are provided with a means to investigate the system in the context of the envisioned work processes. Because (2), investigations into questions of formalization and automation, not only of the system, but also of the work processes, can be made explicitly and become subject for discussions and further elaboration. Adapted engineering approaches are required to cope with the specific characteristics of ambient intelligent systems. Elderly are the most demanding stakeholders for IT-development -- even highly sophisticated systems will not be accepted when they do not address the real needs of the elderly and are not easily accessible and usable. Communication processes are essential in that respect. The evolution and, in particular, the spread of unambiguous symbols were an necessary postulate for the transfer of information, as for example in sign language, speech, writing, etc. In this paper, we report on our experiences in design, development and evaluation of computer applications in the area of ambient assisted living for elderly people, where, to our experiences, engineers highly underestimate the power of appropriate knowledge on semiotics and we demonstrate how we can emphasize universal access by thinking of informatics as semiotics engineering.",

abstract="An ambient assisted living (AAL) approach based on standard home automation devices is presented. The aim of this AAL project is to enable senior citizens to live independently as long as possible. Two basic principles have been observed during the development of the AAL environment: first, in order to make the project a success it is crucial to consider both the needs and the wants of seniors. Second, health monitoring issues are important but the project will only be successful if it comes as a package with additional benefits (comfort, entertainment, safety, and communication). To provide these extra functionalities, the tablet PC-based PAUL -- the Personal Assistant Unit for Living -- has been developed. The HCI has been specifically designed for high ease of use and intuitive interaction. Moreover, PAUL also monitors the activities of daily living (ADL) and can generate alarms. The algorithms and automata used for this purpose are described in this paper.",

abstract="We herein present a hierarchical model-based framework for event detection using multiple sensors. Event models combine a priori knowledge of the scene (3D geometric and semantic information, such as contextual zones and equipment) with moving objects (e.g., a Person) detected by a video monitoring system. The event models follow a generic ontology based on natural language, which allows domain experts to easily adapt them. The framework novelty lies on combining multiple sensors at decision (event) level, and handling their conflict using a probabilistic approach. The event conflict handling consists of computing the reliability of each sensor before their fusion using an alternative combination rule for Dempster--Shafer Theory. The framework evaluation is performed on multisensor recordings of instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., watching TV, writing a check, preparing tea, organizing week intake of prescribed medication) of participants of a clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease study. Two fusion cases are presented: the combination of events (or activities) from heterogeneous sensors (RGB ambient camera and a wearable inertial sensor) following a deterministic fashion, and the combination of conflicting events from video cameras with partially overlapped field of view (a RGB- and a RGB-D-camera, Kinect). Results showed the framework improves the event detection rate in both cases.",

abstract="Falls in the home environment are a serious cause of injury in older people leading to loss of independence and increased health related financial costs. In this study we investigate a device free method to detect falls by using simple batteryless radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in a smart RFID enabled carpet. Our method extracts information from the tags and the environment of the carpeted floor and applies machine learning techniques to make an autonomous decision regarding the posture of a person on the floor. This information can be used to automatically seek assistance to help the subject and decrease the negative effects of `long-lie' after a fall. Our approach does not require video monitoring or body worn kinematic sensors; hence preserves the privacy of the dwellers, reduces costs and eliminates the need to remember to wear a device. Our results indicate a good performance for fall detection with an overall F-score of 94{\%}.",

abstract="When we think about activity in later life, our first thoughts often take us towards the idea of physical activity and the person's ability to remain fit, physically robust, and mobile. The World Health Organization (WHO) has taken a broader view and defined active aging as a state which ``allows people to realize their potential for physical, social, and mental well-being throughout the life course and to participate in society'' (WHO, 2012, p. 1). In this chapter our focus will be on the social dimension of this construct and specifically the potential role that videoconferencing may have in assisting older adults to remain socially active and engaged. We begin by reviewing literature that highlights the positive health and benefits that accrue to older adults who remain socially active. This is followed by the results of qualitative research that illustrates the potential value of videoconferencing technology in remaining socially connected.",

abstract="Falls in the elderly is a major public health problem because of their frequency and their medical and social consequences. New smart assistive technologies and Health Telematics make it possible to provide elderly with more security and well being at home. A smart home can automatically monitor home activities for early warning in health changes or detecting dangerous situations. One of our objectives is to design an automatic system to detect fall at home, which in its final version will be made up of a network of RGB-D sensors. In this paper, we present a simple and robust method based on the identification and tracking of the center of mass of people evolving in an indoor environment. Using a simple Hidden Markov Model whose observations are the position of the center of mass, its velocity and the general shape of the body, we can surprisingly monitor the activity of a person with high accuracy and thus detect falls with very good accuracy without false positives. An experimental study, that is reported here, has been driven in our smart apartment lab. 26 subjects were asked to perform a predefined scenario in which they realized a set of eight postures. 2 hours of video (216 000 frames) were recorded for the evaluation, half of it being used for the training of the model. The system detected the falls without false positives. This result encourages us to use this system in real situation for a better study of its efficiency.",

abstract="Despite their crucial goal of assisting the elderly through their daily routine, Independent Living Support systems still are at their inception. This paper postulates that such systems be designed with a number of requirements in mind, and in particular with safety, security and privacy as fundamental ones. It then correspondingly articulates the three main challenges behind the development of Independent Living Support systems: requirement elicitation, design and correctness analysis. It is found that requirement elicitation will have to cope with a large variety of issues; that design will have to proceed from modularity; and, notably, that correctness analysis will have to be socio-technical. The last finding in particular emphasises that, for a system that prescribes vast interaction with the human, system correctness only makes sense if the system is analysed in combination with the human, rather than in isolation from the human. Building upon previous experience with the socio-technical analysis of Internet browsers, this paper identifies the specific socio-technical challenges that Independent Living Support systems pose, and indicates an approach to succeed in taking them.",

We also claim that technological developments in security neglect the human aspect and in their attempt to produce solutions with quantifiable measures of success they overlook non-quantifiable, yet essential ingredients of everyday existence, thereby creating disembodied, ephemeral scenarios and use-cases. We look at what is missing from the presently dominant, `clean' paradigm, and project the possible results of continuing along this trajectory. We seek alternatives, we explore how biometric technology can be used for an ambient lifestyle, and we draw attention to the concerns that are buried under the worn-out discourse of a positivist approach.",

In particular, it was exploited on pervasive environments to enable simple communication with automation systems. In this paper, we present a novel gesture recognition algorithm that works under uncertainty. The algorithm is based on the tracking of passive RFID tags installed on everyday life objects. The method is able to perform the difficult task of segmentation and recognize basic directions within noisy dataset of positions. A set of tests was conducted in a realistic environment, and the results obtained are encouraging.",

abstract="Based on GPS/Beidou technologies, dynamic safety supervision of commercial operating vehicles has played an important role in transportation industry safety. From the serious traffic accidents occurred in recent years, the major reasons were the improper safety supervision of vehicles. The traditional dynamic safety supervision mode and applications are insufficient. To make up for the lack of traditional dynamic supervision and realize the traceability and visualization of the supervision process, it is necessary to innovate the road transportation safety monitoring, with new management concepts and technologies. Based on the practical understanding of the traditional monitoring status of the industry, this paper proposes the third-party safety supervision of commercial vehicles. We successfully incorporate the application of third parties in other fields world widely and combine it with the development of vehicle dynamic monitoring technology. Through the innovative application of empirical applications in certain areas, the government bureau, enterprises, and monitoring operators all recognized the new model. The overall safety level indicators and accident data before and after the application are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the new model has largely improved the safety level of transportation within the region. At the same time, it has broadened the scale of supervision, practically reducing the corporate costs and operating investment. The new model greatly improves the dynamic security monitoring effect, which satisfies all parties' demands without increasing the input. At present, this model has been promoted and applied in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was proved to have important social and economic significance for modern transportation industries.",

Many of the cognitive skills that humans regularly use to solve problems, imagine, play, and create still stump computer scientists to even define, let alone program. Humans are, by evolution, amazing pattern recognizers, including our ability to see patterns not yet formed. However, the cognitive machinery that gives us this breadth also limits our ability to concentrate on a single thought deeply through many, many alternatives. While some people (like skilled planners or chess players) are better at generating and keeping track of numerous alternatives, the number of alternatives that most people can efficiently handle is well below the thousands of alternatives that computers can routinely generate and manage. Additionally, cognitive skills vary across people, are dependent on our genetics and experiences, and tend to degrade as we age.",

In this paper, we present our approach for creating highly realistic simulation and visualization of activities of daily living (ADL) in smart homes within our Persim 3D simulator. We design and compile a set of ADLs into Persim3D activity library. We present three simulation models for human actions and space objects (necessary for performing and visualizing the activities), and sensors (necessary for sensing the effect of interactions between the virtual character performing the activity and the virtual space). We evaluate Persim 3D's simulation fidelity through use study, by gauging users' perception of the realism of activity visualization.",

If we want to understand whom the plans are for, then we need to know who the people are. Eventually, this will involve actually talking to and planning with the people we are trying to serve. And ideally, we know the area and their residents well enough to not have to go through preliminary surveys. Data, in all its diversity and messiness, helps us from making the mistake of relying completely on our instincts. We deal with the myriads of ways we can get hold of the data that underlies every rational planning process. We juxtapose traditional (though sometimes altered in their character by the surprising variety of provenance) outsider perspectives like demographic profiles with various community-based techniques such as behavior maps, participant observation, sensor, perceptual mapping, or modern survey techniques. Regardless of how all this data is generated, it then needs to be critically assessed to be used in geographic information systems to eventually perform spatial analyses. We regard GIS and Geodesign as local techniques because this is where they show their strengths. We outline the opportunities afforded by these techniques but also provide cautionary notes on their constraints and reflect on the role of planners in a world where technically skilled but nonprofessional citizens are confounding officials with their data wizardry. By necessity, this overview is very high level, and we provide numerous suggestions for further reading at the end of this chapter.",

A growing social problem is supporting older adults who want to live independently in their own homes. It needs a health assistance system to make them independent living up to a higher age. Recently, technological advancements have spurred various ideas and innovations to assist the elders living independently. In this paper, we proposed a homecare sensory system that uses RFID-based sensor networks to collect elder's daily activities and conducts the data into Hidden Markov model (HMM) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to estimate whether the elder's behavior is abnormal or not. Through detecting and distinguishing the abnormal behaviors of elder's daily activities, the system provides assistance on elder's independent living and improvement of aged quality of life.",

abstract="Technological innovations offer many opportunities for design in the context of wearable computers and smart objects and their interaction with user and with ubiquitous computing systems. These technologies can be used to make new products and services designed to collect, increase and share information, knowledge, and emotion, through platforms, which support higher social awareness. If applied to the field of wellness, they can interact among each other, with the network and with the person, to drive and assist people, including socially vulnerable groups, towards an active and dynamic life, and they can become a means for monitoring the state of the user's wellbeing and health.

abstract="The rehabilitation/redevelopment of urban centers is costly and once begun will take several years to accomplish. It is most efficiently completed in stages by discreet neighborhoods within a city and by prioritized need in adjoining shantytowns/slums. The time to start a renewal process is now as pressures from growing populations increase daily as evidenced by the demographic projection that the 2018 city population of {\textasciitilde}4 billion people will rise to 6.9 billion by 2050 fueled as already noted by births, rural citizen in-migration, and sometimes immigration. Today, as previously stated, there are scores of millions of people living in shantytowns/slums in developing and less developed nations especially in Asia and Africa, but also in South America. For most people living in these squalid conditions, basic needs for a reasonably good quality of life are not being provided. What can be expected in terms of social stability as years pass to 2050 and beyond? Restless masses demanding change are a likely answer if indeed municipalities and nations do not show progress to a better life by steadily improving delivery of basic needs to citizens as each year passes. Progress begins slowly with small but real improvements in living conditions in shantytowns/slums by providing basic services that contribute to good public health (safe water, access to adequate sanitation, and regular garbage collection).",

We acquired and extracted the relative risk of different risk factors from relevant literature by searching academic databases. A total of 19 items of risk factors in our daily lives has been finally selected. To design App graphic interface, a total of three pages were designed to let user answer the questions and show the results of their level or risk to have T2DM. We validated the feasibility of our App in 100 users and the results were promising. Therefore, the personalized EBM diabetes risk factor calculator might be a feasible approach to remind those T2DM risky populations by revealing their potential risk factors, thus making implementation of personalized and prevention medicine achievable at hand.",

The interrelation between these two forms of mobility, physical and virtual, both of which have become part of our everyday lives, is worth observing more closely.

abstract="Ensuring ethical value exchange is moving to the forefront of the global challenges that HCI will have to address in the coming years. In this position paper, we argue that applying a context-sensitive, sociotechnical approach to HCI can help meet the challenge. The background is that the life of marginalized people in contemporary society is challenging and uncertain. The marginalized can face health and cognitive issues as well as a lack of stability of social structures such as family, work and social inclusion. Three questions are of concern when innovating together with people `at the margins': how can we describe users without attempting to stereotype badly, what sociotechnical HCI methods fit the local societal context, and how to make the design sustainable in face of current planetary challenges (e.g., climate change)? We adapt the sociotechnical HCI approach called human work interaction design (HWID) to meet the challenges of designing for ethical value exchange. We present three cases of service design, and suggest how to add a fourth similar case using the HWID approach during a field trip and workshop at the INTERACT 2017 conference in Mumbai. We conclude that applying a context sensitive sociotechnical HCI framework implies that both the backend and frontend of service design and product innovations should be executed and valorized from within the local context.",

For instance, doctors and caretakers will spend more time for patients who truly need them and the patient, in its turn, will receive recommendations in order to prevent disease development and progression. This paper presents a novel user-centric approach proposed and researched by the first author in the context of his Master thesis.

abstract="In recent years, there has been an increasing trend towards using video games for health applications. In particular interactive video games, where an individual interacts with the game by moving their limbs or whole body, have started to find application in the field of rehabilitation medicine. The often dull and repetitive nature of rehabilitation exercise can be transformed into an activity to which patients happily adhere via the use of engaging video games that are enjoyable to play. One additional potential benefit of video game use in rehabilitation is that patients can continue to interact with the video game system in their own home following discharge from hospital. As such, video games may offer a means for rehabilitation specialists to remotely assess compliance of patients with their rehabilitation therapy and monitor changes in function over time. Although the use of technology for monitoring health at home is now widespread, an as yet unexplored challenge lies in integrating information technologies with rehabilitation games. This keeps the health professional informed about compliance and progress of the video game exercise, while the patient performs her/his prescribed rehabilitation routine at home. Therefore, there is a strong need for a computational framework to support the medical professional and patient by using an agent-based architecture. Agents are pieces of software that act on behalf of human roles, involved in rehabilitation process. The objective of this chapter is to thus address major issues in designing an agent-based mobile monitoring system for rehabilitation treatments. The chapter also suggests how to remotely measure the patient's progress in rehabilitation treatments while the patient plays video games at home.",

The first convergence, the technology convergence, was in fact many convergences: the wired/wireless and fixed/mobile convergence that gave us the Internet of today and ubiquitous connectivity, the device convergence of smart phones and tablets, and the media convergence that changed the way we consume content at home, work and on the road. The 2nd Convergence is melding technology, business models, social networks and culture and catalyses media and story telling innovation. It is breaking through traditional design silos and is displacing traditional linear value chains and some the predominant business models and creates a new generation of innovators, users and creators across skill and age barriers. This book chapter will review the technology convergence, the first convergence, by revisiting its heritage, establishing its basis, reviewing current and past research and providing early implementation examples as well as challenges and controversies. It will show that the 2nd convergence emerges from it and promises even more innovation in the future.",

This paper presents an innovative way of data management based on a middleware platform providing services for fast and easy creation of applications dealing with the problems of taking care of patients in their homes. The work was carried out as a part of the MPOWER project, funded by the EU 6th Framework Programme, and carried out by a multinational development team. The project focuses on supporting activities of daily living and provides services for elderly and cognitive disabled, e.g. people with dementia. The MPOWER platform is designed to facilitate rapid development of a variety of applications and adopt them to specific users' needs. The paper introduces the whole platform, its functionality and principal goals along with the architectural background of data management, focusing on the different types of data that the system has to manage and analyze. The last section concludes the work done on the project.",

abstract="The application of design within city planning and governance has hitherto taken various, related guises. It is to be found in the renovation of streetscapes for urban regeneration, the development of place-brands, through policies that promote the `creative city' and within cultural planning. Each of these represents relatively `top-down' approaches. More recently, design has been drawn closer into public sector innovation processes in some instances. This may be read as part of a shift in public policymaking from New Public Management to network governance. It also involves a move from design as an objectoidal outcome to design as process. It includes a more person-centred, results-driven approach that pragmatically looks to the most efficient outcome in terms of public sector service delivery. This challenges traditional bureaucracies and spatial arrangements for it invariably transcends their usual hierarchies and boundaries. Key drivers here have been the multiple challenges that have been set through austerity agenda in public policy. New alliances and hybrid possibilities for connecting public administrations and citizens may emerge. This chapter traces some key tendencies and examples here, in order to critically analyse the possibilities and limitations of a concept of design citizenship.",

A previously reported fall detection method using the Microsoft Kinect was used to detect naturally occurring falls in the main living area of each apartment. In this paper, evaluation results are included for 12 apartments over a 101 day period in which 34 naturally occurring falls were detected. Based on computed fall confidences, real-time alerts were sent via email to facility staff. The alerts contained an embedded hyperlink to a short depth video clip of the suspected fall. Recipients were able to click on the hyperlink to view the clip on any device supporting play back of MPEG-4 video, such as smart phones, to immediately determine if the alert was for an actual fall or a false alarm.

abstract="Methods from the area of Process Mining traditionally focus on extracting insight in business processes from event logs. In this paper we explore the potential of Process Mining to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. Events in smart home environments are recorded at the level of sensor triggers, which is too low to mine habit-related behavioral patterns. Process discovery algorithms produce then overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework to automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level. Our framework is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. We use supervised learning techniques to train it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction improve on precision as well as on F-score.",

abstract="The ongoing advance in micro technologies gives rise to increasingly versatile and capable sensors as well as unprecedented computational power and communication options in diminishing scale. The notion of smart dust summarizes ubiquitous computing and sensing application systems, which can serve for local as well as global information acquisition and decision making. For off-the-shelf-nodes, and even more for dedicated physical designs, the system design process becomes increasingly challenging and potentially intractable. Automated design methods emerging for intelligent systems are introduced as a remedy. These considerations will be extended to variations, that multiple system instances have to face in real-world applications and potential compensation by incorporation of self-x properties. These concepts are elucidated for the case of reconfigurable and evolvable sensor electronics. Finally, an application perspective of the presented approach for integrated distributed sensing in home automation, assisted living, and in particular, smart kitchen applications, denoted as culinary assistance systems will be presented.",

Accelerometers are increasingly used to monitor human activities of daily living in different contexts such as monitoring activities of persons with cognitive deficits in smart homes, and monitoring physical and fitness activities. Activity recognition is the most important core component in monitoring applications. Activity recognition algorithms require substantial amount of labeled data to produce satisfactory results under diverse circumstances. Several methods have been proposed for activity recognition from accelerometer data. However, very little work has been done on identifying connections and relationships between existing labeled datasets to perform transfer learning for new datasets. In this paper, we investigate deep learning based transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that takes advantage of learned representations of activities of daily living from one dataset to recognize these activities in different other datasets characterized by different features including sensor modality, sampling rate, activity duration and environment. We experimentally validated our proposed algorithm on several existing datasets and demonstrated its performance and suitability for activity recognition.",

Context-aware physiological pattern analysis with regard to activity performance has great potential for health monitoring in addition to the detection of abnormal lifestyle patterns. In this paper, the successful capture of the relationships between physiological and activity profile information is presented. Experiments have been designed to collect ECG data during the completion of five predefined everyday activities using wearable wireless sensors. The impact of these activities on heart rate has been captured through the analysis of changes in heart rate patterns. This has been achieved using CUSUM with change points corresponding to the transition between activities.

abstract="Some of the needs that people with dementia and their informal carers currently perceive as insufficiently met by regular care and support services might be alleviated, or even be met, using modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The study described in this chapter was designed to provide an insight into the state of the art in ICT solutions that could contribute to meet the most frequently mentioned unmet needs by people with dementia and their informal carers. These needs can be summarized as (1) the need for general and personalized information; (2) the need for support with regard to symptoms of dementia; (3) the need for social contact and company; and (4) the need for health monitoring and perceived safety. Databases that were searched include PubMed, Cinahl, Psychinfo, Google (Scholar), INSPEC and IEEE. In total 22 websites and 46 publications were included that satisfied the following criteria: the article reports on people with dementia and/or their informal carers and discusses an ICT device that has been tested within the target group and has proven to be helpful. Within the first need area 18 relevant websites and three studies were included; within the second need area 4 websites and 20 publications were included. Within the third and fourth need area 11 and 12 publications were included, respectively. Most articles reported on uncontrolled studies. It is concluded that the informational websites offer helpful information for carers but seem less attuned to the person with dementia and do not offer personalized information. ICT solutions aimed at compensating for disabilities, such as memory problems and daily activities, demonstrate that people with mild to moderate dementia are capable of handling simple electronic equipment and can benefit from it in terms of more confidence and enhanced positive affect. Instrumental ICT support for coping with behavioural and psychological changes in dementia is relatively disregarded as yet, while support for social contact can be effectively realized through, for example, simplified (mobile) phones or videophones or (entertainment) robots. GPS technology and monitoring systems are proven to result in enhanced feelings of safety and less fear and anxiety. Though these results are promising, more controlled studies in which the developed ICT solutions are tested in real-life situations are needed before implementing them in the care for people with dementia. It is recommended that future studies also focus on the integration of the current techniques and solutions.",

It begins by considering the debate around gender imbalance in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector and contemplates the challenges and opportunities in addressing this anomaly. It then discusses the career of a female outsider leader (Regina Moran), who has risen through the ranks of a global IT company (Fujitsu) over the last 30 years. As Vice President and Head of Industries EMEAI at Fujitsu and one of the 50 most influential women in Information Technology in the UK, Regina looks back over her career to date and discusses the need for current business leaders and mentors to entice both genders to pursue careers in STEM to help build a reservoir of future female business leaders in these sectors. A conclusion is presented at the end of the chapter, along with a reflection on the chapter's content.",

abstract="Accelerometers are become ubiquitous and available in several devices such as smartphones, smartwaches, fitness trackers, and wearable devices. Accelerometers are increasingly used to monitor human activities of daily living in different contexts such as monitoring activities of persons with cognitive deficits in smart homes, and monitoring physical and fitness activities. Activity recognition is the most important core component in monitoring applications. Activity recognition algorithms require substantial amount of labeled data to produce satisfactory results under diverse circumstances. Several methods have been proposed for activity recognition from accelerometer data. However, very little work has been done on identifying connections and relationships between existing labeled datasets to perform transfer learning for new datasets. In this paper, we investigate deep learning based transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that takes advantage of learned representations of activities of daily living from one dataset to recognize these activities in different other datasets characterized by different features including sensor modality, sampling rate, activity duration and environment. We experimentally validated our proposed algorithm on several existing datasets and demonstrated its performance and suitability for activity recognition.",

abstract="This paper presents the results of a study on how elderly people perceive an intelligent system, embedded in their home, which should enable them to live independently longer. Users of a motion sensor system were interviewed about their experiences. A sensor system that autonomously works as well as a manipulated version was studied. The manipulation contained a touch screen that informed the users if the gathered information was correct before sending it to caregivers, so more control over personal information was provided. To test the use intention of the motion sensor system Spiekermann's Ubiquitous Computing Acceptance Model of was used. This study shows that people, who perceive more control over their wellbeing, show more use intention. And that the subjective norm influences their acceptance. This study shows that acceptance models for Ambient Intelligence application in care situations need to be developed.",

abstract="The rise of progressive cities is an invitation to understand the conditions that enable progressive modes of participatory governance that expand the right to the city in the pursuit of social justice. The focus on progressive cities is essential as cities are rapidly becoming key sites of policy-making in the contemporary world. In contrast to national levels, governance at city scales can more readily foster democratic and vital day-to-day links between government, civil society, and business interests. We stress the different paths taken toward progressive governance, paths marked by democratizing national politics in East Asia and long-standing local democratic participation in Europe. As the studies show, cities are found to be progressive in different ways, and some are experiencing serious junctures that are impeding the gains they have made. The chapter concludes by showing how the 13 city studies of the book are organized along three themes. Theme 1 incorporates the overviews, conceptualizations, and practices in the making of progressive cities. Theme 2 includes chapters that examine specific urban policies focused on inclusion and distributive justice. The authors of chapters brought together in theme 3 explore the idea of conviviality and the associational life of city residents and nonresidents at community and city scales. Discussions of the urban commons, vernacular heritage, and relations with the natural environment are included to show how motives other than those for material gain also arise from grassroots mobilizations and local governance politics aimed at enhancing of urban lifeworlds. The chapters in this book provide hopeful as well as cautionary tales about struggles for progressive cities. Our intention is not to prove that a given city is progressive in any absolute way. It instead uses the lens of our concept of progressive cities to comparatively assess processes of urban governance in the world today and, in so doing, contribute to shifting the discourse on cities toward ideas of human flourishing.",

As elderly potentially refuse or forget to wear any additional sensors to activate alarm calls, FEARLESS will visually and acoustically detect and handle risks by contacting the relatives or care taker organization automatically - without the need of any user intervention. This is done by using only one single type of sensor making the system affordable for everyone. It increases the feeling of safety, reduces fears, enhances the self-efficacy and thus enables elderly to be more active, independent and mobile in today's self-serve society.",

Then feature information determined the fall is extracted based on the neck key point tracking algorithm. The feature for judging fall, namely the angle between leg and horizontal plane, is proposed in this study. The experimental data is based on the simulated fall videos took from Leqiao station of Soochow 1st metro line in Jiangsu province. Our results show that, the single picture and video are tested respectively, and it is found that the timing information is more fault-tolerant and more accurate in identifying falls, yet is more complex and more difficult to implement. What's more, because of the lack of sufficient fall videos, the results analysis based on the proposed algorithm remains much room for improvements. Also, more useful and efficient detection characteristics can be taken into account in the future.",

abstract="This paper addresses the problem of reasoning under conflicts within rule-based systems. Nowadays, using logical rules to infer knowledge, express restrictions and so on has shown a great interest in several domains which makes rule-based systems very popular. However, since rules may originate from heterogeneous sources and change over time, methods are required to maintain rules consistency by detecting and resolving the conflicts. The method we put forward in this work refines a form of non-monotonic reasoning called argumentation with new definitions. Through implementing and evaluating the framework to a smart home test-bed, the proposed framework dynamically detects and flexibly resolves conflicts. The result proves the efficiency and viability of our proposal.",

abstract="Understanding what the user is doing in a Smart Environment is important not only for adapting the environment behavior, e.g. by providing the most appropriate combination of services for the recognized situation, but also for identifying situations that could be problematic for the user. Manually building models of the user processes is a complex, costly and error-prone engineering task. Hence, the interest in automatically learning them from examples of actual procedures. Incremental adaptation of the models, and the ability to express/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks, are also desirable. First-order logic provides a single comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all of the above. This paper presents a First-Order Logic incremental method for inferring process models, and show its application to the user's daily routines, for predicting his needs and comparing the actual situation with the expected one. Promising results have been obtained with both controlled experiments that proved its efficiency and effectiveness, and with a domain-specific dataset.",

Care policies (i.e. Event-Condition-Action rules) can be used to specify care services, facilitating changes in the behaviour of a home care system. Context modelling allows a user to specify the trigger and conditions of a care policy, using high-level context rather than raw sensor data. The actions of a care policy are, however, still dependent on the implementations details of actuators. We propose a framework that allows the actions of a care policy to be specified abstractly using human-understandable concepts. The framework takes care of discovering and using specific actuators, hiding the low-level home networking details from ordinary users. It therefore makes personalisation and modification of home care systems more accessible to ordinary users, requiring very little technical knowledge.",

The aim of this research is to increase the security, confidence and independence of the elderly as well as their relatives. To achieve such objective, this research proposes using a network of multiple Kinect sensors installed in different areas of a house monitoring the individual with the ability to interact with the person by voice or video, if required. The Kinect sensors analyze the everyday life and routines of the person. This analysis allows the individual to be traced, and means an automatic detection of risks in real time, decreasing the response time required in the event of a health emergency.",

Novel human-computer interaction systems and techniques are required to fill the gap between elderly reduced physical and cognitive capabilities and the smooth usage of technological artefacts densely populating our environments. Gesture-based interfaces are potentially more natural, intuitive, and direct. In this paper, we propose a personalized hand pose and gesture recognition system (called HANDY) supporting personalized gestures and we report the results of two experiments with both younger and older participants. Our results show that by sufficiently training our system we can get similar accuracies for both younger and older users. This means that our gesture recognition system can accommodate the limitations of an ageing-hand even in presence of hand issues like arthritis or hand tremor.",

Ubiquitous, smart home technologies can fulfill this role, but a thorough understanding of elders' routines, lifestyles, and home environments is required in order to develop effective aids. This paper describes our research approach, which evolved from stories related in household interviews (`tales'), ethnographic observation of elders' routines and environments (`tours'), analysis of artefacts (`tools') and finally interactive performances (`troupes') to convey and elicit feedback about the capabilities of future home technologies for the elderly. This combination of methods revealed a range of user values, behaviours, coping styles, and requirements for ubiquitous technology that would otherwise have been difficult to gather in this domain of ubiquitous, `invisible' computing.",

Acceptability is not only related to human factors such as button size and legibility, but rather relates to perceived value and harmony in relation to existing living patterns. This paper describes the design of an asynchronous interactive communication system based upon a bulletin board metaphor. A panel of end-users was involved in various stages of the design process. To improve ease of use, functionality exposed to elderly users is limited, while caregivers are given extended control. A pilot field study with a working prototype showed a high degree of user acceptance. The user centered approach resulted in a design concept that was acceptable for the elderly participants.",

abstract="Applying ambient intelligence to assistive technologies and remote monitoring systems is a challenging task, especially in the field of healthcare. In this chapter, we focus on how ambient intelligence has been implemented within the telemonitoring and home support system developed in BackHome, an EU project that aims to study the transition from the hospital to the home for people with disabilities. The proposed solution adopts a rule-based approach to handle efficiently the system adaptation, personalization, alarm triggering, and control over the environment. Rules are written in a suitable formal language, defined within the project, and can be automatically generated by the system taking into account dynamic context conditions and user's habits and preferences. Moreover, they can be manually defined by therapists and caregivers to address specific needs. In this chapter, we also present the concept of ``virtual device'', which is a software element that mashes together information from two or more sensors in order to make some inference and provide new information. The abstraction of sensor information creates a powerful layered system, which provides a simpler, more readable and more natural description of the rules. Thanks to the proposed solution, end-users can rely on the automatic customization of their user interfaces according to their context and preferences; caregivers can personalize the system to the user's need; and therapists can monitor user's activities easily and can be informed as soon as an alarm is triggered or an anomaly detected.",

In 2009, a major urban regeneration project named `The Sustainability Park' (Parque da Sustentabilidade) was launched by the city council. Supported by the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF 2007--2013), the project involved 15 local and national partners, including the University of Aveiro and the Association of Small Businesses (commerce), and a budget of nearly 14 million euro, subdivided into 17 subprojects. This chapter presents the story of the project. As soon as the project became public, primarily through the media, citizens protested about the fact that they had not participated in the proposal's design, nor had they been informed, to say the very least. This situation prompted a strong civic movement to call the City Council's attention to the potential harmful impact of these projects on the local environment and on the daily lives of residents. This contribution describes how movements tried to engage in a series of talks with the politicians involved and bring tacit and codified knowledge to the process.",

Successful innovations comply to a complex system of social, technical, and financial attributes. First we narrow down the vast amount of innovations in healthcare into a review set of innovations and select attributes of successful innovations from literature. Next the compliance of the review set with the attributes is assessed by an expert panel. There exists no metric to objectively measure compliance and empirical data analysis cannot be performed because there are no data. Six innovations with high expectations were assessed: smart homes, eHealth, electronic health records, self management, robotic assisted devices and online health companion contacts. None complied convincingly to all attributes. Innovation in healthcare appears as a multi-level, multi-sector, multi-disciplinary transition and needs both successes and failures to make progress.",

The dynamics of globalisation and the progressive individualisation of society are phenomena that, in different ways, lead to a greater desire for well-being, when the primary needs are achieved or exceeded. Human beings have acquired awareness about the fact that to satisfy this desire it is necessary to pursue a harmonious relationship with nature and landscape. Food and nutrition are directly involved in this search for balance between the need to obtain the nourishment for living and respect for the environmental dimension. In contemporary society nature is no longer considered a source to be exploited in order to satisfy human needs but a precious ally that allows improvement in the lives of all living beings with its resources.",

abstract="As the number of elderly people living worldwide and average life expectancy increases, older adults' safety assurance has become increasingly important. There are many works on safety issues of the elderly focusing on human activity classification. Most of them use external sensor devices and/or completely or partially user input based classification and prediction systems. In this paper, we have developed an algorithmic model, monitored and documented elderly people`s daily activities by using the gyroscope and accelerometer of a smartphone and with the use of those data and model, we calculated how much activity is required or overdone for a subject in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. More importantly, we built a real time system that could not only judge what basic activity the subject is currently doing, but also protect the subject from possible injury that might happen to the subject if abnormal data is received.",

There is a great demand of supporting systems that are able to ensure medical safety for these people. In order to determine the health state of a person an obvious choice would be to draw conclusions from the behavior patterns which can be deduced from the ADL (Activities of Daily Living). Different technologies are available for recording ADL. Some of them are presented in this paper. Following that, the system ``eventlogger'' will be introduced and the interaction of patients, mapped in a geriatric day hospital, and the resulting behavioral patterns, will be analyzed.",

Such an assessment is useful, since the context of the innovations change rapidly as a result of the health care reform process. Successful innovations comply to a complex system of social, technical, and financial attributes. First we narrow down the vast amount of innovations in healthcare into a review set of innovations and select attributes of successful innovations from literature. Next the compliance of the review set with the attributes is assessed by an expert panel. There exists no metric to objectively measure compliance and empirical data analysis cannot be performed because there are no data. Six innovations with high expectations were assessed: smart homes, eHealth, electronic health records, self management, robotic assisted devices and online health companion contacts. None complied convincingly to all attributes. Innovation in healthcare appears as a multi-level, multi-sector, multi-disciplinary transition and needs both successes and failures to make progress.",

abstract="Our research group has been studying a speech communication system with a virtual agent (VA), to support person-centered care (PCC) of people with dementia (PWD). The current system uses an unfamiliar avatar for the VA, which causes a limitation in the care effects. In this paper, we develop a novel system that dynamically creates a VA based on a given facial image. The proposed system constructs a three-dimensional model based on facial landmarks within the image. It then stretches and transforms some portions of the 3D model to generate facial expressions. From just a given picture, the proposed system easily generates a communication agent familiar with individual PWD. Hence, it can implement (virtual, but effective) conversations with familiar partners.",

The focus is on body area sensing networks incorporating the primary enabling technologies: sensors for capturing the physiological and kinematic data, and data analysis techniques for extracting the clinically relevant information. With respect to the StrokeBack project, the majority of this chapter is dedicated towards physical activity monitoring---a key component in stroke rehabilitation. In particular, the domain of upper limb rehabilitation is examined since reduction of upper limb motor function is a common effect of stroke and significantly impairs the performance of patients as they engage in activities of daily life. As an example, a case study is presented where different arm movements are recognized in real time using data from inertial sensors attached to the arm. Tracking the occurrences of specific arm movements (e.g. prescribed exercises) over time can give an indication of rehabilitation progress since the frequency of these movements is expected to increase as motor functionality improves.",

Depth video is provided by low-cost RGB-D sensors unobtrusively installed in the house. The user's location, posture, as well as point cloud -based features related to gestures are extracted; a standing/sitting posture detector, as well as novel features expressing head and hand gestures are introduced herein. To model the target activities, we employed discriminative HCRFs and compared them to HMMs. Through experimental evaluation, HCRFs outperformed HMMs in location trajectories-based ADL detection. By fusing trajectories data with posture and the proposed gesture features, ADL detection performance was found to further improve, leading to recognition rates at the level of 90.5 {\%} for five target activities in a naturalistic home environment.",

abstract="Home environments are one of the subjects of study regarding ambient intelligent systems for various purposes, including development of assistance systems for the elderly and energy consumption optimization. Sensing the environmental state via different sensors is the first and crucial component of every ambient intelligent system. In this work we investigate the use of environmental sounds for touch-free audio-based device recognition in a home environment. For this purpose, we analyzed sound characteristics of typical home appliances using different processing techniques. We are using the acquired knowledge to develop a flexible set of features, which can be set manually or determined automatically. To classify the device-specific acoustic fingerprints -- consisting of a significant subset of our features -- we use established supervised learning techniques, whereby we optimized the straightforward ones. After building a recognition basis for the recognition of fixed length sound buffers on demand, we implemented a live recognition mode for real-time environment monitoring, providing runtime setup adjustments. We then extended our work with the recognition of untrained, simultaneously working, known devices by mixing their records, utilizing semi-supervised learning. We then anticipated promising results in our evaluation in various aspects, including recognition rate, performance for the different combinations of features, as well as to study the reliability of an automatic mixing of trained data.",

In this area, specific tasks undertaken by the persons in the context of their normal day-to-day lives reveal a wealth of information to be used to customize their environment to improve their living experience. In our current work we investigate the development of models which can be used to represent, classify and monitor basic human behaviors and support observation and control of activities of daily living. In particular, in this paper we focus on the problem of automated recognition of sequences of events that may indicate critical conditions and unexpected behaviors requiring intervention and attention from caregivers. Our work is based on a formal framework developed with temporal logic used for the specification of critical sequences of patterns and a behavior checking engine for automated recognition. In addition we have also developed an approach to provide a means of interaction with user. A visual formalism for the specification of Linear Temporal Logic expressions reduces the barrier of technical complexity enabling the involvement of experts in the domain of healthcare services to interact with the system.",

A previously developed technical system for unobtrusively recording location information using home automation data was installed in the homes of five participants aged 64--84 years over a period of partially more than nine month. The recordings are manually evaluated to check whether items of geriatric assessment tests relevant to self-care ability can be assessed using the sensor recordings. The evaluation is a preliminary step to develop an automatic assessment algorithm and to develop a model for mapping domestic assessment results to result scales of clinical assessment tests. The mapping is required since most clinical assessment tests are not suitable for execution in domestic environments and thus new approaches are required which do also account for the difference between performance and capacity in functional abilities as proposed within WHO's ICF.",

The work presented addresses these questions 1) What daily activities the elderly participants like to be monitored, 2) With whom they would want to share this monitored data and 3) How a monitoring system for the elderly should be designed. For this purpose, this paper discusses the study results and participatory design techniques used to exemplify and understand desired ambient-assisted living scenarios and information sharing needs. Particularly, an interactive dollhouse is presented as a method for including the elderly in the design and requirements gathering process for residential monitoring. The study results indicate the importance of exemplifying ambient-assisted living scenarios to involve the elderly and so to increase acceptance and utility of such systems. The preliminary studies presented show that the participants were willing to have most of their daily activities monitored. However, they mostly wanted to keep control over their own data and share this information with medical specialists and particularly not with their fellow elderly neighbours.",

abstract="India has been facing rapid transformation processes for about the last two and a half decades. One of the most critical manifestations and drivers of these changes is economic growth, which is a consequence of external (globalisation) and internal factors (liberalisation and economic reform since the early 1990s) -- both interrelated. Along with economic development, there are other dimensions of social and environmental change, such as rapid urbanisation, rising incomes, a maturing young workforce, emergence of a new and rapidly growing middle class, and associated social-cultural changes. These apparently positive developments involve a multiplicity of interrelated processes and mechanisms that directly and indirectly create social, ecological, and political risks and challenges. For instance, the social effects of economic development have to be looked at from two sides. On the one hand, the last two decades of growth have led to an escalator effect, which has lifted large parts of the poor out of poverty. However, on the other hand, social disparities have grown substantially -- between different regions and between urban and rural areas. Moreover, the fast character of change and the lack of effective institutions have led to tremendous social and environmental risks and challenges. And, as a form of ``umbrella effect'', most of these changes take place in urban areas in a concentrated manner, with the consequence of powerful feedback mechanisms that further drive urbanisation and serve as a pull factor for rural-to-urban migration. Hyderabad is taken as a representative example for many other megacities in India. This city defines the geographic frame for an analysis of processes that transcend physical-spatial boundaries by far. Such concentration, however, allows that the manifest locational aspects anchoring these processes on the ground are not lost sight of in the analysis.",

abstract="Community care is a complex operation that requires the interaction of large numbers of dedicated individuals, managed by an equally wide range of organisations. They are also by their nature highly mobile and flexible, moving between clients in whatever order person receiving care is that they receive what they expect regularly, reliably and when they expect to receive it. Current systems are heavily provider focused on providing the scheduled care with as high apparent cost effectiveness as possible. Unfortunately, the lack of focus on the client often leads to inflexibility with expensive services being provided when they are not needed, large scale duplication of effort or inadequate flexibility to change the care regime to meet changing circumstances. Add to this the problems associated with the lack of integration of emergency and routing care and the extensive support given by friends and family and many opportunities exist to improve both the levels of support and the efficiency of care. The move towards Individual Care Plans requires much closer monitoring to ensure that the care specified for each individual is actually delivered and when linked with smart home technology in conjunction with appropriate sensors allows a much richer range of services to be offered which can be customised to meet the needs of each individual, giving them the assurance to continue to live independently.",

abstract="Social isolation in urban areas is a societal challenge. It affects people of all ages but particularly elderly who struggle to maintain social ties into later-life. Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory. It proposes the use of the Integrated Behavior Model as a theoretical framework for understanding behavioral determinants and explores the use of games as a way of fostering changes in attitudes that could enhance intergenerational interactions.",

abstract="This chapter presents some of the early design work of the `Care in the Digital Community' research project --- begun under the EPSRC IRC Network project EQUATOR. One objective of the project is to improve the quality of everyday life by building and adapting technologies for a range of user groups and application domains. Consequently, it is very much concerned with developing supporting technologies based on a comprehensive understanding of user needs. Meeting this objective will require us to address fundamental and long-term research challenges in how computing technologies and concepts relate and adapt to a range of everyday domestic environments, including those characterised as `care' settings. The Digital Care project employs a multidisciplinary research team to facilitate the development of enabling technologies to assist care in the community for particular user groups with different support needs. The general aim is to examine how digital technology can be used to provide various kinds of support to sheltered housing residents and their staff. Although the project anticipates exploring the affordances of a variety of technological configurations, including the use of virtual environments replicating real world situations and the use of handheld and wearable digital technology, the focus of this chapter is on our early work on providing support for the medication regime.",

Civic engagement is, however, difficult to attain both from the perspective of citizens' willingness and ability to participate and government's ability to generate such engagement. E-government can play a role in enhancing civic engagement by allowing more and better opportunities for the same. In this chapter, I explore the theoretical and empirical literature on civic engagement, e-government, and their interaction. In the process, I identify key debates surrounding civic engagement through e-government, reveal some of the nuances associated with it, and through an operationalization of civic engagement through e-government, highlight the tools and techniques that are used to achieve it.",

Each case aimed to streamline the development of a product or service innovation in a Lean startup manner as an alternative to the traditional NPD.

Driving force to choose the organizational alternative is novel business endeavor rather than being depended on the company.

The improvements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) have resulted in the development of equipment that supports ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and intelligent user interfaces. The smart home technologies, assisted robotics, sensors for health monitoring and e-health solutions are some examples in this category. Despite such growth in these individualized technologies, there are only few solutions that provide integrated AAL frameworks that interconnect all of these technologies. In this paper, we discuss the necessity to opt for an integrated solution in AAL. To support the study we describe real life scenarios that help us justify the need for integrated solutions over individualized ones. Our analysis points to the clear conclusion that an integrated solution for AAL outperforms the individualized ones.",

abstract="The increase in prevalence of chronic disorders in modern societies has resulted in increasing organizational and financial pressure on healthcare systems. The challenge of adequate care delivered to patients with chronic conditions, who want to remain in their social context, promotes the search for effective models of care. Adequate use of information and communication technology may be an appropriate response to this challenge. Chronic patients require repetitive interactions with the healthcare system. High-quality care adhering to evidence-based medicine strategies must be delivered to a vast population of patients in a continuous manner. The experience from studies and pilot implementations of information technology tools in specific groups of patients suffering from chronic diseases indicates that considerable benefits may be gained related to improved cost-effectiveness and simultaneously maintained quality of care. It seems that e-health strategies may help to fulfill two contradictory requirements --- provision of high-quality medical services and preservation of the cost-effective approach. Available evidence supports the use of e-health solutions for care delivery. The results of trials based on the use of integrated IT-enhanced model of care with focus on patient empowerment and better interdisciplinary team communication demonstrated improvement of such outcome measures like hospitalization rate, frequency of ambulatory visits and level of quality of life in populations of chronic patients. However, it must be emphasized that a new model of care based on the effective use of e-health solutions cannot be implemented without adherence to legal, ethical and psychosociological requirements existing in the healthcare environment.",

Different people have different characteristics and abilities and each user has different needs which means that products have to be tailored accordingly. Microwave ovens are one of the most commonly used home appliances. People use them to quickly heat or cook certain foods. Today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 90{\%} of U.S. households own a microwave oven. This project seeks to enable people with intellectual disabilities and physical impairments to perform simple cooking tasks. The target group includes ageing people who experience difficulties in using microwave systems, with a particularly low grade of autonomy in preparing foods and meals. In order to address the specific needs of the defined group of users, the research follows the principles of the Quality Function Deployment analysis and takes inspiration from the DfA (Design for All) theories and the UCD (User Centred Design) method. The aim of the research is to find new solutions in order to simplify certain activities of daily living for users who would otherwise be excluded from these actions. In the second stage, the project, seeks to provide a set of tools that enable the interaction with smart appliances to grow the sense of community, by sharing information within a social network and a Cloud-based service system. The main challenge is to create a ``Community Supported Appliance'' that provides technology and settings for enabling users in performing one daily activity. The CSA is intended to be a simple to use, affordable learning system, continuously fed from the community of carers and service users, that has the potential to be used, in the near future, by a wider group of people. A device of this type benefits from added value given from expert users to others in the community, in the form of sequenced multimedia instructions to the person and direct operating instructions to the appliance.",

abstract="The growth in elderly population challenges technologists to develop applications explicitly designed for the elderly which are innovative yet intuitive to use. According to recent studies in Gerontology, one of the challenges that an elderly person has to confront is solitude and boredom. With the detectability of emotions through Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), one can provide reliable services to the elderly that address their emotional needs. In this paper the applications of the Emotiv EPOC, a BCI, is explained by developing a system called AWARE which helps mitigate loneliness in the life of an elderly and provides emergency services and other services based on their real-time emotional state. The AWARE system uses a model of computation that has taken pervasive computing to the next level by reducing the need for an explicit user input and facilitates the understanding of the user's emotions by the system to address theirs emotional needs.",

We report experiences from an explorative multiple case study covering eight cases from four companies of different sizes and business characteristics. Each case aimed to streamline the development of a product or service innovation in a Lean startup manner as an alternative to the traditional NPD. We present eight life-cycle paths that together exemplify the use of the five organizational alternatives, such as internal startup and company subsidiary. Driving force to choose the organizational alternative is novel business endeavor rather than being depended on the company. Using even multiple organizational alternatives is possible during the innovation life-cycle as long as the speed and independence for the innovation is achieved.",

abstract="A motivation behind much UbiComp research has been to make our lives convenient, comfortable and informed, following in the footsteps of Weiser's calm computing vision. Three themes that have dominated are context awareness, ambient intelligence and monitoring/tracking. While these avenues of research have been fruitful their accomplishments do not match up to anything like Weiser's world. This paper discusses why this is so and argues that is time for a change of direction in the field. An alternative agenda is outlined that focuses on engaging rather than calming people. Humans are very resourceful at exploiting their environments and extending their capabilities using existing strategies and tools. I describe how pervasive technologies can be added to the mix, outlining three areas of practice where there is much potential for professionals and laypeople alike to combine, adapt and use them in creative and constructive ways.",

We believe that this study will help develop information and communication technology (ICT) systems for caring for people with dementia (PWD). We installed a video monitoring system for caregivers in three homes and observed the positive and negative effects of applying the system to caregiving. In terms of positive effects, the video monitoring system enabled caregivers to optimize their work and helped them concentrate on their tasks at hand, reducing both mental and physical stresses. On the other hand, some caregivers expressed concerns over being watched by other caregivers through the monitor, especially when their activities were recorded. We discuss these issues and explain how the concept of a Triage Support Environment may lead to a solution for these problems.",

In fact, this is our second attempt to achieve that. Although tailored for smart homes, this virtual butler could be applied to other types of smart spaces and environments, such as shopping malls, airports, industry, etc. The developed virtual butler is able to interact with users by voice and it is sensitive to user location (and other context information).",

abstract="In recent years, social innovation has become an increasingly prominent concept employed by political leaders and administrations across the world. In 2003, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) supported a range of initiatives and research to promote inclusive entrepreneurship and `improve social cohesion through the identification and dissemination of local innovations'. In 2009, President Barack Obama established the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation to support cross-sectoral, bottom-up solutions to social problems and challenges in the USA. In Europe, social innovation has proved to be equally conspicuous in pan-European strategies and domestic policies. Innovation has been of enduring interest and concern for European Union (EU) policy for many years (Borzaga and Bodini 2014), but since the late 1990s social innovation in particular has captured the political interest of supranational organisations and domestic actors (Pol and Ville 2009; Grisolia and Ferragina 2015). In the EU, social innovation has been posited as a solution to both old and new social risks at a time of heightened uncertainty and pressure on public administrations and finances (Bonoli 2005; OECD 2011; Sinclair and Baglioni 2014). It seems clear that this considerable interest in social innovation has been intimately linked to the Great Recession, structural unemployment and the social challenges arising as a result (European Commission 2014a). Indeed, a key feature of the Europe 2020 strategy was to facilitate and embed social innovation across Europe to `deliver the kind of inclusive and sustainable social market economy we all want to live in' (BEPA 2010: 16).",

abstract="All western industrialised nations face important new challenges in meeting the long-term health and social care needs of their populations. Over the past two decades, an important demographic and epidemiological transition has taken place. Age-related and long-term chronic illnesses have replaced communicable diseases as the biggest challenge that health systems must now address. More than half of the growing number of people aged over 65 in Europe are living with more than three chronic conditions, and about one-fifth have five or more concurrent health problems (Anderson and Horvath, 2004). This shift means that the economic burden of age-related chronic illness represents between 75--80 per cent of healthcare expenditure, a figure that is also expected to rise as society ages (Nolte and McKee, 2008). Current health and care systems, however, appear to be ill equipped to meet the challenge as they have developed systemic and institutional structures that focus on cure rather than care. As a result, and particularly in an era of economic uncertainty, most countries and regions have begun the search for new and more integrated care models --- supported by technological innovation --- that place the emphasis on preventing ill health, supporting self-care and delivering care closer to people's homes.",

This paper presents an algorithm of fall detection for the ageing-at-home of the elderly. This algorithm detects fall events by identifying (human) shape state change pattern reflecting a fall incident from video recorded by a single fixed camera. The novelty of the algorithm is multiple. First, it detects fall occurrence by identifying the state change pattern. Second, it uses the camera projection matrix in its computing. Thus, it eliminates camera setting-related learning. Lastly, it adds constraints to state change pattern to reduce false alarms. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a promising performance.",

abstract="In recent years, much research has focused its attention on Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Its potential applications to smart homes, hospitals, health monitoring or daily life assistance make this paradigm a very promising field of research that can have a great and positive impact in our lives. The combination of AmI environments and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has emerged as a perfect solution for the development of this kind of applications. However, there are many challenges to be addressed before such applications can be put into practice. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on MAS aimed to build rehabilitation systems for people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and explain how this architecture has been applied for the development of Vi-SMARt: a system for defining and planning therapies for people with ABI, and to control and evaluate their rehabilitation process.",

abstract="A new architecture is suggested in this paper for an Assistive Platform in an Ambient Computing for elderly or disabled people. In this situation, interaction between the user, the environment and the platform is guided by means of a generated process. Depending on the context, the elements of the process are dynamically assembled. The aspect of assembly is based on rules that are set through an online learning operation. This new approach of designing an assistive platform is validated through devices integrated in a powered wheelchair with those implemented within the environment. Rules of operation evolve depending on a data base which is continuously updated depending on user's daily activities.",

abstract="In the personal or corporate spheres, the home/office of tomorrow is soon to be the home/office of today, with a plethora of networked devices embedded in appliances, such as mobile phones, televisions, thermostats, and lamps, making it possible to automate and remotely control many basic household functions with a high degree of accuracy. In this domain, technological standardization is still in its infancy, or remains fragmented. The different functionalities of the various appliances, as well as market factors, imply that the devices that control them communicate via a multitude of different protocols (KNX, LonWorks, InOne). Building a high level middleware to support all the appliances seems to be a reasonable approach. However, market factors has shown that the emergence of a unique and universal middleware is a dream. To solve this issue, we have built a new generation of schizophrenic middleware in which service access can be generated from an abstract services description. EnTiMid, our implementation of schizophrenic middleware, supports various services access models (several personalities): SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UPnP and DPWS (Device Profile for WebServices). In this paper, we describe how these personalities are generated using a Model Driven Engineering approach and discuss the benefits of our approach in the context of a deployment of new services at the city level.",

This paper explores the factors influencing the consumer's behavioral intention to use IRCTC Connect by adapting Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Regression analysis is used to analyze total 159 valid responses, collected through survey at MNNIT campus Allahabad, India. The findings of the study illustrate that only three factors Social Influence, Price Value and Habit of UTAUT2 model are significantly influencing the adoption of IRCTC Connect with adjusted R-Square value 0.699. This study will facilitate IRCTC Connect developers to encompass better understanding on consumers' desires and intention and encourages researchers in this area for longitudinal observation in different backgrounds.",

abstract="All western industrialised nations face important new challenges in meeting the long-term health and social care needs of their populations. Over the past two decades, an important demographic and epidemiological transition has taken place. Age-related and long-term chronic illnesses have replaced communicable diseases as the biggest challenge that health systems must now address. More than half of the growing number of people aged over 65 in Europe are living with more than three chronic conditions, and about one-fifth have five or more concurrent health problems (Anderson and Horvath, 2004). This shift means that the economic burden of age-related chronic illness represents between 75--80 per cent of healthcare expenditure, a figure that is also expected to rise as society ages (Nolte and McKee, 2008). Current health and care systems, however, appear to be ill equipped to meet the challenge as they have developed systemic and institutional structures that focus on cure rather than care. As a result, and particularly in an era of economic uncertainty, most countries and regions have begun the search for new and more integrated care models --- supported by technological innovation --- that place the emphasis on preventing ill health, supporting self-care and delivering care closer to people's homes.",

abstract="Robotics is a very fast-growing field and presents us with both a number of exciting possibilities and the threat of significant changes to society, possibly in unforeseeable and undesirable directions. The chapter discusses the associated ethical issues. It is introduced by definitions and statistics on different types of robots and continues to a brief overview of some of the main technological developments and current and probable future applications of robots. The concept of roboethics is then introduced and the limitations of early approaches based on Asimov's (I, Robot i,robot.pdf. Accessed 14 May 2014) laws of robotics are noted. However, the more general definition (Veruggio and Operto, Roboethics: social and ethical implications of robotics. In: Siciliano B, Khatib O (eds) Handbook of robots. Springer, Berlin, pp 1499--1522, 2008) is able to cover the wider social implications of the introduction of robots and could be extended to include the impacts on the environment and other species. The ethical issues of current and future applications of robots are illustrated by a number of examples covering a wide range of applications, including health care, military robots and toy and companion robots. A number of the ethical theories presented in Chap. 2are then applied to the evaluation of several of the applications of robots.",

In the last decades, it is tried to face these challenges by developing technical solutions in the area of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Besides technical functions and opportunities, the acceptance of future users is decisive for a successful implementation of those technologies in everyday life situations. As AAL technologies have an enormous potential to support care staff as well as caretakers in professional care situations, it is questionable to what extent professional care staff accepts and adopts to use assisting technologies in their professional everyday life. In more detail, it is of major interest to analyze how care professionals perceive potential benefits and barriers of AAL technology usage, specific characteristics of data gathering and storage as well as if individual user factors of care professionals influence the perception and acceptance of AAL technologies.",

abstract="This paper is concerned with the modality of gestures in communication between an intelligent wheelchair and a human user. Gestures can enable and facilitate human-robot interaction (HRI) and go beyond familiar pointing gestures considering also context-related, subtle, implicit gestural and vocal instructions that can enable a service. Some findings of a user study related to gestures are presented in this paper; the study took place at the Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Lab, a 60m2 apartment suitable for the elderly and people with physical or cognitive impairments.",

abstract="The concept of ambient intelligence (AmI) has recently been adopted related to living scenarios and denoted as ambient assisted living (AAL). It has received high attention related to the demographic shift and the positive options of care and support for elderly people at home and on the move. However, there exists an equally important field of application related to work. In the context of labour high mobility and flexibility of people is requested. The demand to work up to higher ages complements the situation. People in the workforce develop growing expertise and different abilities over time. They need tailored support systems at work keeping the efficiency and effectiveness and elements of prevention or adjustment to changing abilities. Indeed, environments in industry and at work provide already a high degree of networking and computing infrastructure, much more than in the private sector and can provide a basis for an advanced AmI infrastructure. The idea is discussed within the framework of creating accessible workplaces for people with disabilities. Here, so far a reactive strategy has been followed based on the individual case. Only in case a concrete person with a disability is included in the work force and only in that very moment a workplace adaptation is considered. However, now this reactive strategy is outdated, because today the complete infrastructure needs to be considered to make a workplace accessible. Following an AmI strategy --ambient assisted working (AAW) provides a flexible approach towards workplace adaptation for all, including people with disabilities and older people in the workforce. In order to use AAW, the process has to start much earlier in a more inclusive way. Without knowing the exact demands of a future worker, the system needs to be designed. The flexible networking character of AmI provides the required flexibility.",

abstract="We propose an activity recognition system for the elderly using a wearable sensor module embedding a tri-axial accelerometer, considering maximization of battery life. The sensor module embedding both a tri-axial acceleration sensor and an RF transmission module is worn at the right side of one's waistband. It connects and transfers sensing data to subject's PDA phone. Then, an algorithm on the PDA phone accumulates the data and classifies them as an activity. We utilize 3 tilts in addition to 3 acceleration values, compared to previous works. However, we reduce the sampling rate of the sensing data for saving battery life. As an activity classifier, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm is used, and we have achieved 96{\%} of accuracy in detecting an activity out of 9. It shows the proposed method can save the battery life without losing the recognition accuracy compared to related works.",

abstract="Current healthcare systems face new challenges due to the ageing population in the world. Aged population (over 65 years) has become a significant proportion of the total population in most of the countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in every four people will be over 65 years by 2056 [1]. With increasing demand for healthcare facilities, researchers have paid their attention towards improving existing healthcare infrastructure. Mobile healthcare has become a lucrative area in the eyes of researchers as well as entrepreneurs. Non-invasive and ambulatory health monitoring has become increasingly popular in modern healthcare as a solution for the increasing demand for hospital facilities. It has gained popularity not only for patient monitoring, but also in the field of sports where vital signs of sportsmen are monitored while they are on the field [2]. Ability to remotely monitor patients has many benefits. It is a solution for the increasing demand for physical infrastructure at hospitals. With the use of mobile health facilities, the requirement of patients being physically present in a hospital is eliminated. Vital body information can be transferred to a remote database via internet. Since the patients are monitored in real time while they are involved in their day to day activities, obtained parameters give more realistic overview of patient's health status. Consider a patient with high blood pressure; if it is possible to remotely monitor his/her blood pressure throughout the day, physicians can get a more realistic idea how the blood pressure builds up prior to reaching a certain threshold. Also it can eliminate inaccurate results caused by changed physical conditions that occur due to travelling to a hospital. It also makes it easy to keep track of the patient's or sportsman's health history. An early health warning system can also be implemented using this technology. An efficient Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is able to provide all the aforementioned benefits to both patients and physicians.",

abstract="The fast growing mobile sensor technology makes sensor-based lifelogging system attractive to the remote elderly care. However, existing lifelogging systems are weak at generating meaningful activity summaries from heterogeneous sensor data which significantly limits the usability of lifelogging systems in practice. In this paper, we introduce SensCare, a semi-automatic lifelog summarization system for elderly care. From various sensor information collected from mobile phones carried by elderlies, SensCare fuses the heterogeneous sensor information and automatically segments/recognizes user's daily activities in a hierarchical way. With a few human annotations, SensCare generates summaries of data collected from activties performed by the elderly. SensCare addresses three challenges in sensor-based elderly care systems: the rarity of activity labels, the uncertainty of activity granularities, and the difficulty of multi-dimensional sensor fusion. We conduct a set of experiments with users carrying a smart phone for multiple days and evaluate the effectiveness of the automatic summary. With proper sensor configuration, the phone can continue to monitor user's activities for more than 24 hours without charging. SensCare also demonstrates that unsupervised hierarchical activity segmentation and semi-automatic summarization can be achieved with reasonably good accuracy (average F1 score 0.65) and the system is very useful for users to recall what has happened in their daily lives.",

Conversely, the robot can be seen as a communicating object which is used by services to the person in loss of autonomy. We describe an architecture for cooperation between the robot and the ambient environment composed of sensors or actuators. One of the difficulties is that the robot is evolving in a crowded and not predictable physical environment. It is therefore necessary to have mechanisms of adaptation for answering to various or unforeseen situations so that the robot can move reliably in the home. It is necessary also to take into account two constraints, at first the degree of urgency of the service and secondly the degree of discomfort caused by the presence of a robot which is able to act near the person and see the person in her/his privacy.",

Environments would become smart and proactive, enriching and enhancing the experience of participants thus supporting maximum leisure possibly even at the risk of alienation. New insights have revealed that these brave new world scenarios are no longer desirable and that people are more in for a balanced approach in which technology should serve people instead of driving them to the max.

abstract="This chapter deals with the question of how people use digital technologies in order to get a better understanding of the world surrounding them, thus offering a cognitively inspired perspective to the current digital transformation of society. After delineating the importance of information and information processing, we introduce the concept of informational environments as the set of informational resources that a person habitually taps into over a life-course in order to get a better understanding of the world. Implications of this definition are discussed. We also introduce the two main themes of the current book and provide a preview on the subsequent chapters. The first main theme (effects of use) is to provide descriptive accounts of how people currently make use of their informational environments. On the one hand, effects of use depend on cognitive, motivational-affective, and social-interactive characteristics of a person. On the other hand, effects of use depend on the characteristics of the environment (e.g., rules and regulations). The second main theme (effective designs) prescriptively refers to the way that informational resources in an informational environment can be designed to improve learning. It is argued that digital technologies can provide such learning opportunities inasmuch as they engender teacher-like characteristics. Among these are cognitive characteristics (e.g., fostering self-regulation skills), motivational-affective characteristics (e.g., fostering emotion regulation), and social-interactive characteristics (e.g., providing interactive support that is adapted to the current needs of a learner).",

The proposed hybridization approach replaces the local and global pollination operations from the Flower Pollination Algorithm with Path Relinking-based strategies aiming to improve the quality of the current solution according to the global optimal solution or to the best neighbouring solution. We model the problem of generating healthy nutritional meals as an optimization problem which aims to find the optimal or near-optimal combination of food packages provided by different food providers for each of the meals of a day such that the nutritional, price, delivery time and food diversity constraints are met. To analyse the benefits of hybridization, we have comparatively evaluated the state-of-the-art Flower Pollination Algorithm, adapted to our problem of generating menu recommendations, versus the hybridized algorithm variant. Experiments have been performed in the context of a food ordering system experimental prototype using a large knowledge base of food packages developed in-house according to food recipes and standard nutritional information.",

This enables reasoners and automated decision makers to understand the environment and the data collected from it.

abstract="Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technologies are more and more often adopted in scenarios, like healthcare, environments monitoring and control, ambient assisted living, etc, which are critical for human safety and assets preservation. This requires that such a kind of applications be designed taking into account stringent dependability requirements. This paper presents a service-oriented middleware architecture for safety critical Ambient Intelligence applications, which provides services that enable the designer to develop runtime verification mechanisms; that is, it is possible to continuously monitor the verification of correctness properties defined at design time.",

abstract="The miniaturization of electrical and electronic equipment is certainly not a new phenomenon, and its effects have long been evident in the healthcare sector. Nevertheless, reducing the size of medical devices is one thing, wearing them is quite another. This transition imposes a new set of design requirements, challenges and restrictions and has further implications on their use, as they are often intended for operation by non medical professionals in uncontrolled environments. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the use of wearable devices in healthcare along with the key enabling technologies behind their design, with emphasis on information technologies. Furthermore, it aims to present the current state of development along with the potential public benefits in both technological and healthcare terms. The devices described are those involving some degree of digital information handling, thus excluding conventional wearable devices such as eyeglasses, hearing aids and prosthetic devices from the discussion.",

However, besides considering service-oriented response to the user needs, the assistance has to take into account the establishment of social relations. We propose the use of a robot NICA (as the name of the project Natural Interaction with a Caring Agent) acting as a caring assistant that provides a social interface with the smart home services. In this paper, we introduce the general architecture of the robot's ``mind'' and then we focus on the need to properly react to affective and socially oriented situations.",

abstract="Empathic computing is an emergent paradigm that enables a system to understand human states and feelings and to share this intimate information. The new paradigm is made possible by the convergence of affordable sensors, embedded processors and wireless ad-hoc networks. The power law for multi-resolution channels and mobile-stationary sensor webs is introduced to resolve the information avalanche problems. As empathic computing is sensor-rich computing, particular models such as semantic differential expressions and inverse physics are discussed. A case study of a wearable sensor network for detection of a falling event is presented. It is found that the location of the wearable sensor is sensitive to the results. From the machine learning algorithm, the accuracy reaches up to 90{\%} from 21 simulated trials. Empathic computing is not limited to healthcare. It can also be applied to solve other everyday-life problems such as management of emails and stress.",

In some instances, a single safeguard might be sufficient to address a specified threat or vulnerability. More typically, however, a combination of safeguards will be necessary to address each threat and vulnerability. In still other instances, one safeguard might apply to numerous treats and vulnerabilities. One could depict these combinations in a matrix or on a spreadsheet, but the spreadsheet would quickly become rather large and, perhaps, would be slightly misleading. Just as the AmI world will be dynamic, constantly changing, the applicability of safeguards should also be regarded as subject to a dynamic, i.e., different and new safeguards may need to be introduced in order to cope with changes in the threats and vulnerabilities.",

Fall-related clinical variables and health care satisfaction were assessed before, immediately after the intervention and two months later. Health care satisfaction was evaluated at the end of the intervention. All participants showed improvements for all of the variables measured: balance ($\Delta$ between 1-6/56), fear of falling ($\Delta$ between 3-17/60), motor function for the leg and postural control ($\Delta$ between 1 and 2 stage), functional gait ($\Delta$ between 11-47{\%}), and lower limb strength ($\Delta$ between 20-43{\%}). Satisfaction was also high. The result supports the feasibility of in-home Tai Chi teletreatment as a valuable alternative for some stroke patients.",

abstract="Robotic, smart homeSmart homeand other related technologies that are integrated in AAL environments should be combined and presented to their users in an unobtrusive way. ObtrusivenessObtrusivenessis a subjective, multidimensional, environment-dependent and multi-target concept that is used to describe how various technologies can negatively impact the daily lives of their users. Many of the negative implications come forward as a conflict between primary users (elderlyElderlypeople) and secondary users (clinical staff, (in)formal caregivers). In this chapter, we present the methodology followed during the design and development of the RADIO system to guarantee that the final solution is the least obtrusive for its users. To begin with, primary and secondary user requirements are set under the prism of obtrusivenessObtrusivenessdimensions and possible conflicts are described. The major clash presented is the gap between individual perceptions on privacyPrivacyand, reliable and sound clinical information. Bridging this gap depends most of the time on the means (sensors) used to monitor clinically interesting activities and the state of the art of the technical methods that exploit these data. The level of obtrusiveness of using a specific sensor depends on what activity is monitored as well as where this monitoring happens. In the processing pipeline that follows raw data collection, the main consideration is the type of output information (raw data, activity log, aggregates on logs). To put all this information together, we introduce a decision-making process for including a clinical assessment item in a monitoring system and we demonstrate with examples how this workflow can be followed in developing system's such as RADIO. Finally, we discuss several actions that must be taken in the design and development of system such as RADIO to ensure that overall unobtrusiveness is satisfied. Assigning obtrusivenessObtrusivenessimplications to a certain clinical assessment item highly depends on subjectivity of several constructs. However, here we define a framework within which intrusiveness constructs should be discussed and negotiated.",

abstract="Given that the population is aging, it is crucial to develop technologies which will not only help the elderly to age in place, but also live in place with independent and healthy lifestyle. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments can help the elderly and people with functional diversity by anticipating their needs in specific situations and acting proactively in order to properly assist them in performing their activities of daily living (ADLs). Since the users needs tend to be very diverse in regard to functioning and disability levels, it is crucial to have personalized services capable of providing tailored assistance to a user based on their unique preferences, requirements, and desires. This paper introduces the ontology named AATUM (Ambient Assistive Technology User Model), to be adopted by systems whose goal is to enhance user quality of life within ALL environments through service personalization. Its main feature is the use of The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to model the user's functioning and disability levels in a consistent and internationally comparable way. The use of the proposed ontology is illustrated through its application in two different case studies.",

abstract="In advanced service economies, almost any activity, skill, and asset can be bought on competitive markets, making it increasingly difficult to build competitive advantage on any of those inputs. Therefore, firms have to carefully decide what to own in order to capture value. That is, firms have to explore what types of assets can add value to their customers and at the same time are difficult or illegal to copy by competition. We examined this question and identified asset categories that potentially allow a firm to appropriate value. They are (1) resource-based assets (e.g., proprietary equipment and systems, manufacturing-related intellectual property (IP), and social capital with employees); (2) platform-based assets (e.g., physical and intellectual platform assets, and critical mass and volume-based advantages); and (3) market-based assets (e.g., brands and related brand equity, physical and virtual points-of-sale, access to physical and virtual distribution networks, and customer information and loyalty programs). Furthermore, we propose that each of these three asset categories can take the form of three types of capital. They are (1) tangible capital (i.e., it has a physical manifestation such as equipment and physical points-of-sale); (2) intangible capital (i.e., it can be codified and legally protected such as patents and brands); and (3) social capital (i.e., it is embedded in people's minds and cannot be legally protected such as trust, goodwill and engagement of employees, partners and customers). The three asset types and their three manifestations are integrated into a framework for an asset typology. For example, market-based assets can come in all three forms, that is in tangible (e.g., point-of-sale networks), intangible (e.g., brands), and social (e.g., customer equity) form. Finally, we identified four important organizational capabilities of asset integration that are independent of asset ownership but effectively link owned and outsources assets, capabilities, and processes to value creation and can also allow a firm to capture value. They are (1) business models for designing the architecture and ``Gestalt'' of value creation; (2) a customer-centric culture and a climate for service; (3) innovation capabilities, and (4) the effective management of an integrated web of processes and activities. We discuss the why and how of this asset typology and its implications for management, strategy, and research.",

abstract="Keeping a healthy and balanced diet has long been a critical issue for a person wanting to stay fit and energetic in her/his daily life. We can always turn to a dietitian (or a nutritionist) for professional diet suggestions if necessary. However, we cannot have a dietitian staying with us all the time, which renders daily nutrition control very challenging. Therefore, it is desirable for each individual to receive handy and informative diet suggestions whenever necessary. In this work, we propose a Context-aware Personal Diet Suggestion System (CPDSS) which tries to maximize an aggregated health utility function and provides useful diet suggestions according to some contextual information. In order to increase the practicality of the pro- posed system, we have integrated the CPDSS with an everyday appliance--a smart refrigerator--so that we can readily access the suggestions about one's diet, receive instant context-aware reminders while preparing foods, and keep long-term diet history to extract more useful pat- terns to caregivers to provide suggestions for health improvement.",

abstract="This chapter presents an argument against the core features of `ecomodernism,' i.e., a school of thought which presents itself as a form of sustainable/environmental philosophy while being in reality the new Trojan Horse of neoclassical economics in the field of environment. In effect, ecomodernists offer a new momentum to the capitalist agenda, its rejection of ecological limits, and its support to the techno-optimist and neoliberal rearrangement of the world. The first shortcoming of this theory lies in its denial of ecological boundaries which makes ecomodernists support a robust conception of substitutability (substitution of human capital for natural capital) and a correlative weak version of sustainability. Secondly, ecomodernism is flawed in its conception of unlimited economic growth (supported by the myth of decoupling) as a sustainable pattern for human societies, as well as in its conception of human nature understood under the reductionist concept of Homo Oeconomicus. Contrary to those views, this chapter presents the reconstructive components of a sound ecological economics (strong sustainability, weak substitutability, degrowth/post-growth and post-capitalism) as being the only sustainable alternative to the dominant forms of ecological modernisation (e.g., `green capitalism'). This new ecological economic paradigm considers the economy, broadly defined as the system of management and allocation of existing resources, as a dependent subsystem of earth's ecosystem and emphasizes, therefore, the irreplaceability of the natural capital, as well as the pressing necessity to restore/protect/preserve natural processes wherever and as much as possible. The general aim of this chapter is to propose a constructive agenda for an ecological economics in the Anthropocene.",

abstract="Use processes are under-researched in marketing theory. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the research on this topic in marketing. The main part of the paper is devoted to the description of an empirical sociological field study on the use of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technology. For the description and the analysis of the sociological project, we draw on service-dominant logic for marketing. We evaluate how the users of a complex AAL system managed to integrate the AAL technology with their own resources. The research presented in this paper could also be understood as a study on the preconditions of market making. It shows how solutions can be created in a sensitive field that is of both individual and societal importance. ``We argue that value is fundamentally derived and determined in use -- the integration and application of resources in a specific context rather than in exchange -- embedded in firm output and captured by price'' (Vargo, S.

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) refers to ambient intelligent environments where health and personal care is monitored to help to ensure elder's health, safety, and well-being, detecting possible situations that should be watched over. To effectively reason about a current situation and determine its criticality, it should be compared to past patterns. Current systems that learn patterns do not take into account the context in which they occur and we believe adding contextual variables to the description of patterns could improve the reasoning about current situations. Moreover, it can help improve the notification process to dynamically select who and what should be notified, maintaining the privacy of the elder and avoiding spam. In this paper we detail our proposal for a system that adds context to behavior patterns in order to then create personalized messages to the different members of the network of care of an elder living alone.",

abstract="The widespread dissemination of sustainability, the rapid urbanization of the world, and the global rise of ICT are the three most important global trends at play across the urban world today. They will most likely change the way cities can be managed and developed drastically. They are also rendering the tasks of urban management increasingly more challenging on many scales with regard to city development. This implies that the management of urban systems and what they entail in terms of operations, functions, processes, and services in the context of smart sustainable cities require complex interdisciplinary knowledge pertaining not only to project management and multiscale and participatory governance, but also to the administration of ICT and related computational and data analytics processes. These three urban management functions are particularly associated with significant risks and challenges that need to be managed and overcome, respectively, in the process of making decisions as part of the development of smart sustainable cities of the future. However, topical studies on project management, governance, and risk management approach these topics from a general perspective predominantly. From a somewhat specific perspective, the focus in this chapter is rather on these urban management functions in relation to smart sustainable cities as having distinctive characteristics with respect to both the ubiquity presence and massive use of ICT and what this entails in terms of information security risks as well as the complexity of multiscale and participatory governance structures and project management processes. This chapter intends to explore urban and ICT project and related risk management in the context of smart sustainable cities, as well as the various models of governance of their functioning and development. The emphasis in risk management is placed on both urban development and ICT projects as well as information security in relation to the use of cloud computing as an increasingly widely applied solution for big data and context-aware applications. As to governance models, we put emphasis on polycentric, participatory, and big data forms. This is deemed of particular importance to providing insights into workable, practice-oriented solutions for the management of the complexity of smart sustainable cities increasingly being sought by urban planners, strategists, policymakers, and decision-makers.",

In this paper, we propose a new service that uniformly manages the user context, and allows external applications to retrieve necessary user contexts efficiently. More specifically, the proposed service gathers heterogeneous data from different systems, and standardizes the data with a common database with general attributes of when, who, whom, where, what, how, and why.

In this paper we synthesize the extant findings of patient innovation research, and explore the current limits of patient innovation, including its value and impact. In particular, we discuss the implications that the phenomenon may have on health care systems and the value that society may harness from innovative patients. We use insights from a multiple case study to address barriers to patient innovation---solution development and diffusion---and elaborate on ways to improve it.

abstract="A new concept for safely performing and qualitatively evaluating assessments in domestic unsupervised environments, especially when utilizing mobile service robots, is presented. The presented approach is based on the idea that classical geriatric assessments, especially from the domain of mobility, may be divided in components which happen naturally throughout the day in domestic environments. Those components are measured separately and are recombined to com-plete assessment tests later on. In order for physicians to decide how reliable assessment results from the domestic do-main are, we define technical quality criteria for the components of the Timed Up{\&}Go assessment test. The approach is evaluated within an experiment in a living lab utilizing sensors, especially a laser range scanner, equipped with a mobile robot. Results show that the presented approach may be used to separate sensor measurements promising good assess-ment results from those containing insufficient data. Additionally, using mobile robots to perform assessments in domestic environments holds the potential danger for the inhabitant to stumble over the robot. Therefore, the paper also evaluates the aspect of inhabitants' safety during domestic assessments based on the experiment's data. A novel approach to navigate safely using the previously presented approach of optimal observation lots (OOL) is presented.",

The system is designed to recognize and classify major activities occurring within a bathroom based on sound. Carefully designed HMM parameters using MFCC features are used for accurate and robust bathroom sound event classification. Experiments to validate the utility of the system were performed firstly in a constrained setting as a proof-of-concept and later in an actual trial involving real people using their bathroom in the normal course of their daily lives. Preliminary results are encouraging with the accuracy rate for most sound categories being above 84{\%}.

abstract="The healthy cities movement was launched at a time of great openness to new ideas and concepts in the area of public health. It was very attractive to local political leaders, it inspired a wide range of new actors and it spread very quickly. Healthy Cities as a project embodied a number of key features that proved crucial in its success, including a strong emphasis on values, political commitment, partnership-based approaches, democratic governance, strategic thinking and networking. It combined the discipline of a well-defined project involving committed cities with mechanisms of inclusiveness and engagement of all interested cities. Healthy Cities thrived at the cutting edge of public health continuously broadening and adapting its agenda to new knowledge, developments and emerging local needs. It has changed the way cities understand and deal with health. Healthy Cities represents a unique example of a long-term sustainable WHO initiative that forged strategic links with local governments. The evidence and experience accumulated in the past 27 years have demonstrated repeatedly that Healthy Cities works and it makes a difference. There is however a tremendous amount of knowledge out there in the cities that are part of this movement that was never documented and analysed. Healthy Cities is now more relevant than ever. The time is right for WHO and governments at all levels to use its potential to the full and actively recognize the importance of urban health and local leadership for health.",

In this paper, we present a system to generate personalized health recommendations from various providers, based on classification of health related calendar events on the user's smartphone. Due to privacy constraints, such personal data often cannot be uploaded to external servers, hence the classification and personalization has to run on the client device. We use a server to train our model to classify calendar events using SVM and fastText, while the prediction is run on the client device using the trained model. The class labels from the classified calendar events, weighted in order of recency, are used to build a vector, which we treat as a representation of user interest while personalizing the recommendations. This vector is used to re-rank health related recommendations obtained from third party providers based on relevance. We describe the implementation details of our system and some tests on its accuracy and relevance to provide relevant health related recommendations. While we used the calendar app to classify events, our system can also be extended for other apps such as messaging.",

abstract="An increasingly significant characteristic that has emerged through the use of eHealth applications is the rise in consumer empowerment. The latest advances in sensor technology, sensors implementation, improved wireless telecommunications capabilities, open networks, continued increases in computing power, improved battery technology, and the emergence of flexible software architecture has led to an increased accessibility to healthcare providers, more efficient tasks and processes, and a higher overall quality of healthcare services. Intelligent infrastructures have provided the layers for contextual information gathering, knowledge processing as well as adaptation and optimization mechanisms. Pervasive health monitoring and care (PHMC) would shift the paradigm of healthcare from the traditional reactive, event-driven model, to one were subjects proactively manage their health in a patient centered healthcare system. The objective of this work was to identify requirements and barriers to adoption of pervasive sensing and computing in healthcare. To do so, the authors systematically reviewed published works on health information technology, eHealth, and pervasive health care, since 2005. We found technological, financial, psychological, logistic and liability issues related with requirements and barriers to PHMC adoption. We identified as potential requirements related with adoption of PHMC: optimization of hardware and software for remote, unobtrusive health monitoring; better evaluation of the implemented systems; better coordination of the involved stakeholders; respect and improvement of existing standards for eHealth or new standards realization; collaboration and team work of all stakeholders that may benefits from pervasive health implementation; training in using new technology; training for searching library and information sciences related with health technology and information communication technology; training in thoughtfully analysis of added value associated with new health technology; promotion of healthier lifestyle using health information technology; analysis of social and organizational change process in order to design flexible, adaptive systems for health monitoring and care; adequate policy support for quality improvement of pervasive health systems; transparency with regard to the goal, business plan and process implementation of pervasive healthcare; consideration of patients' perception as well as healthy individuals perception and patient-physician relationship as a core organizational operational system for PHMC; healthcare equity through improved data collection; education for technology literacy; and education for lifestyle management using new technologies. Barriers to implementation are associated with: financial constraints; privacy policy and related issues; poor transparency towards work plans and with regard to the implementation of health information technology; underestimation of complexity of the technological, clinical process and organizational problem; less or even lack of collaboration and team work of all stakeholders - patients, doctors, therapists, sociologists, engineers, computer technicians, etc.; fragmented or lack of responsibility in management of health information system implementation; low effective, persistent and consistent management of system implementation for more closely coordinated forms of health and social care provision; lack of quality audits of health information technology implementation in some healthcare systems; health professionals perception related mainly with less evidences on added value of some implemented eHealth approaches; aspect of culture associated with all stakeholders involved in health information communication technology. For the future it would be desirable to set up a comprehensive method that provides support in implementing PHMC taking into account quantitative measurements of variable identified in this work and potentially supplemented by others standardized surveys.",

abstract="Context-aware systems in mobile and pervasive environments face many conflicting situations while collecting sensor data, processing sensor data to extract consistent and coherent high level context information, and disseminating that context information to assist in making decisions to adapt to the continuously evolving situations without diverting human attention. These conflicting situations pose stern challenges to the design and development of context-aware systems by making it extremely complicated and error-prone. Quality of Context parameters can be used to cope with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the conflicting situations that a context-aware system may face at different layers of its conceptual design and present the conflict resolving policies that are defined on the basis of the Quality of Context parameters. We also illustrate how these policies can be used in different conflicting situations to improve the performance and effectiveness of context-aware systems.",

The idea is to integrate depth sensor and motion sensor. We illustrate the sensor fusion concept and implement the wireless fall detection sensor sub-system. We experiment with angular acceleration data in three limbs parts of human test target. Different life patterns of elderly are selected to test the motion monitoring system: walking and falling. Two methods are employed as diagnosis tool. The first is the energy expenditure method, while the second is the neural network method. The first tests the sensitivity of motion sensor, while the second filters out the noisy motion data for correct classification purpose. We discovered that the trained weights and bios from the neural network based on three limbs parts measurement data has allowed us to differentiate fall from regular walk motion with high accuracy.",

According to this perspective, mobile robots are no longer autonomous, physically situated and embodied entities adapting themselves to a world taliored for humans: on the contrary, they are able to interact with devices distributed throughout the environment and get across heterogeneous information by means of communication technologies. Information exchange, coupled with simple actuation capabilities, is meant to replace physical interaction between robots and their environment. Two benefits are evident: (i) smart environments overcome inherent limitations of mobile platforms, whereas (ii) mobile robots offer a mobility dimension unknown to smart environments.",

The intervention groups received once-weekly, one-hour therapy sessions targeting 3 mobility and 3 transfer tasks delivered either by Traditional In-Home Therapy or remote interactive Tele-Technology. Participants completed a 10-item, Likert scale measure of task self-efficacy at enrollment and after four weeks. Overall the intervention groups had a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy compared to the control. Comparisons between the two treatment delivery methods showed a medium standardized effect size (SES) in both groups compared to controls, although it did not reach statistical significance for the Tele group (SES Tele 0.35 [-2.5-.95]; Trad 0.54 [0.06-1.14]). Although further study is needed, this trend towards increased self-efficacy irrespective of the mode of rehabilitation delivery suggests that tele-rehabilitation can be a viable alternative to traditional in-home therapy.",

abstract="There is a strong motivation, in particular in the domain of healthcare, for new perspectives on context-driven research and computing in order to provide next-generation services to people that are tailored to individual needs rather than generalised assumptions that could potentially endanger human life. For that, context awareness is a key requirement in order to reach a better understanding of human-centric computing systems and environments, and subsequently, the deployment of dedicated services that are specifically adapted to the context to which they are applied. Such context-driven services would be able to provide the means of delivering situation-aware and person-centric services that ultimately may even anticipate future behaviour and problems of the user itself and the context in which the user finds themselves. However, the perpetual provision of contextual data in pervasive environments is far from being easy and includes major challenges that vary between environments. The reason for this is not only the sensor diversity within the environments themselves but also the contextual scope to be analysed and the amount of data to be collected and correlated to actually reach a minimum degree of contextual understanding. For that reason, in this chapter, contextual environments have been categorised as well as their interaction into different groups that reflect individual contextual levels of interest of which contextual understanding is required and consequently to which services can be applied.",

In parallel, the system provides interfaces to pass the obtained data forward for further processing and (professional) analyses, in case the user agrees. The system is designed to be used in every day's activities and it is not restricted to laboratory use or environments.

Recently, task computing (TC) paradigm has gained acceptance as the choice computing model for pervasive computing environment. One of the key components of TC is a task model that provides an adequate high-level description of user-oriented tasks. This paper presents a novel context-sensitive task modeling approach capable of supporting complex, user-oriented task definitions, and proposes an algorithm to discover a task and a method to execute it. This work is motivated by the fact that whilst current TC systems allow users to interact with their ambient environments in terms of high level tasks, existing task definitions are still relatively simple, and do not include user-centric and environmental contextual information in the task definition. This paper elaborates the proposed task model through a smart home application example to illustrate steps in context-dependent task modeling, service provisioning and resource organization.",

abstract="Social isolation and loneliness are among the important factors for the degradation of the life quality as the persons' aging process advances. These factors can have a pronounced effect on the general health and are caused by the decrease in social interaction by the person with the friends, family and ex-co-workers groups. On the other hand, the software and hardware technologies has reached a maturation point were the electronic assistants can acquire information from the user through camera images, as well as to communicate with the user by means of natural voice language. In this context, a model for the adoption of electronic intelligent assistants by the elderlies has been proposed in previous work. In the current work, it is assessed the possibility of using the current consumer assistants to implement the proposed model. Several assistants are analyzed (Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple), assessing their functionalities and how they could be used to assist the elderly in strengthening their social bonds with the family, friends and ex-co-workers groups.",

The user should benefit from the fact that the system offers an easy interface reporting the status of his body in real time. In parallel, the system provides interfaces to pass the obtained data forward for further processing and (professional) analyses, in case the user agrees. The system is designed to be used in every day's activities and it is not restricted to laboratory use or environments.

abstract="Pervasive computing applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of inhabitants of the environment, such as their locations, activities, vital signs, and environmental measures. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in ``aging-in-place'' scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.",

abstract="This study in the Indian context focuses on the gender-specific labour force participation across regions and makes an attempt to identify the important determinants. Before turning to the Indian situation, the participation rates are examined for various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In India like many other countries, the female participation rate is significantly lower than that among the males. The rural--urban differentials are more pronounced, and the interstate variations are sizable in the case of females than males. Even in the large cities the female labour market participation is lower than that in the rural areas despite higher levels of education. However, in terms of inter-spatial (rural/urban/city) variations, the impact of infrastructure, education, health and urbanization on labour force participation of both the gender is quite distinct. With improved infrastructure, the quantum of investment is expected to shoot up and the accessibility to growth centres offering better livelihood opportunities can perk up. While industrialization and growth in services show a positive effect on participation, economic growth unravels a positive impact on urban males only. Also, there is evidence on poverty-induced participation in agricultural activities, suggesting clearly the importance of rural diversification for creation of productive employment. Women's participation improves child health significantly. Access of mothers to resources enhances the health status of the children as their nutritional status and access to curative health care get better. On the whole, women participation in productive activities has a double effect: first, it raises the household income; second, it contributes to the well-being of the household. These findings are important from policy point of view because different infrastructure variables are seen to improve both participation and labour productivity. Infrastructure (social, physical and financial) can to certain extent break the social and cultural barriers and help women join the labour market, thus enabling them to make productive contribution to the growth process. Though the level of urbanization raises the urban participation rate in an inter-spatial sense, a similar pattern is not evident in the context of rural females (at least at the state level). How urbanization can be made more generative with positive spillover effects in the rural neighbourhood is an important policy concern because increased urbanization ushering in greater concentration of non-farm activities holds the potentiality to create employment prospects and at the same time result in productivity gains.",

Systems that manage these environments need to manipulate the context for interacting in a suitable way with users. One big challenge for creating a smart environment is to deal with context dynamicity. Ideally, these computer-supported environments must detect relevant events to forecast future situations and to act proactively to mitigate or eliminate situations related to specific user's needs. This paper proposes a framework for providing extensible, reactive and proactive behavior in Smart Environment systems. The focus of the present work is related to a specific class of Smart Environments: an Ambient Assisted Living. In this sense we define a framework and illustrate practical aspects of the use of framework by describing a home-care scenario in which the system observes the behavior of the user, as the time goes by, and detects relevant situations and acts reactively and proactively for preserving user health condition.",

abstract="In this paper a psychologist discusses the desirable relationship between the elderly and Artificial Objects based on some questions raised by an engineering researcher. Concretely, the paper discusses the differences between Objects, Machines, and Artificial Objects. Through this, it reveals the characteristic of Artificial Objects and presents the following four points that can be potentially problematic with respect to the relationship between such objects and the elderly. Moreover, these points should also be kept in mind by engineering researchers when developing Artificial Objects. 1) Artificial objects move autonomously, and therefore users can not take the role of initiator. That is, people must accommodate to artificial objects. 2) Artificial objects still only have a limited learning ability for creating relationships with their users, including the understanding of contexts and a shared history not unlike that between people. 3) Even with increased leaning ability as a result of increased efficacy and expanded operating capacity, which in turn leads to the creation of better relationships between artificial objects and persons, there are limitations to such relationships. 4) There is a need to point out the problem of initially focusing too heavily on the functions that artificial objects should have. Especially for the elderly, engineers should take time to consider the relationships of dependency that the objects they design will gradually foster over time.",

abstract="Assistive Technologies offer the possibility to develop services aimed at improving the Quality of Life of patients and caregivers. Specifically, this work refers to the case of persons with dementia who can live in their homes but need to be assisted. This paper describes a monitoring kit that provides alarms to the caregiver in case of dangerous situations or unusual events detected by the sensors. It is composed by a set of non-intrusive sensors installed within the house, and can be configured in order to best fit with the needs of each patient. The proposed system could have the potentiality to reduce the stress that usually affects the caregivers, due to the continuous effort required and the worry about the patients' safety. The improved system results from an existing solution that has been re-visited according to the feedbacks obtained from a pilot trial.",

abstract="Long term eldercare is often labor intensive. This paper addresses a multimodal sensing approach to situation awareness for elderly care using video and force sensitive resistor (FSR) sensor map. For elderly people, especially those with limited mobility, it is useful to keep care givers or family members known of their situations that may lead to abnormal patterns such as repeated action (get up and sit down) or hazardous result such as a falling from bed. By using multimodal sensing with video camera and FSR sensor, the situation awareness algorithm is proposed to detect and track human activities. Experiments have shown the effectiveness of the detection of primary situations for elderly care.",

abstract="Business solutions and security solutions are designed by different authorities at different coordinates of space and time. This engineering approach not only makes the lives of security and the business solution developers easy but also provide a proof of concept that the concerned business solution will have all the security features as expected.But it doesn't provide a proof that the integration process will not lead to conflicts between the security features in the security solution and also between security features and the functional features of the business solution. For providing a conflict-free secured business solution, both the developers of security solution as well as of the secure business solution need a mechanism to identify all possible cases of conflicts, so that the developers can redesign the corresponding solutions and thus resolve the conflicts if any. Conflict arises due to different authorities and configuration and other resource sharing among the solutions under integration. In this chapter, we discuss conflicts during integration of security solutions with business solutions covering the wide spectrum of social, socio-technical and purely technical perspectives. The investigated recent approaches for automated detection of conflicts are also discussed in brief. The ultimate objective of the chapter is to discover the best suited approaches for detecting conflicts by software developers. It spans over approaches from cryptographic level to policy level weaving over the feature interaction problem typically suited for software systems. The assessment of these approaches is demonstrated by a remote healthcare application.",

The increased acceptance of mHealth is often related to the diminished obtrusiveness of the device monitoring, coachingCoachingautomated coaching, diagnosing, and/or collecting data of its user. However, such `unobtrusivenessUnobtrusivenessobtrusiveness' not only has gains, but might also come at a cost. This paper focuses on how obtrusiveness currently plays a role in the design and use of mHealth, and what social and ethical implications are associated with this role. To gain such understanding a literature review of PubMed and Web of Science was performed. Discourse analysis is used to study the identified themes in the review and the introduction of unobtrusiveness in mHealth. This analysis demonstrates a tension between the modernist discourse and the humanist discourse, since both discourses articulate obtrusiveness in a different way. While unobtrusiveness seems desirable from a users' acceptance and design perspective, mHealth that is designed to be unobtrusive does have reported social and ethical implications. The developers and designers of future mHealth services should be aware of these implications. Users should be informed about the trade-off they make between unobtrusive monitoring or coaching via mHealth and potential infringement of privacy, loss of autonomy and will-power.",

This paper presents two main contributions. First, we present ContextAct@A4H, a new real-life dataset of daily living activities with rich context data (This research is supported by the Amiqual4Home Innovation Factory, http://amiqual4home.inria.frfunded by the ANR (ANR-11-EQPX-0002)). It is a high quality dataset collected in a smart apartment with a dense but non intrusive sensor infrastructure. Second, we present the experience of using temporal logic and model checking for activity recognition. Temporal logic allows specifying activities as complex events of object usage which can be described at different granularity. It also expresses temporal ordering between events thus palliating a limitation of ontology based activity recognition. The results on using the CADP toolbox for activity recognition in the real life collected data are very good.",

abstract="An ontology-based context-aware framework for behavior analysis and reminder delivery is described within this Chapter. Such a framework may be used to assist elderly persons maintain a healthy daily routine and help them to live safely and independently within their own home for longer periods of time. Behavior analysis associated with the delivery of reminders offers strategies to promote a healthier lifestyle. Current studies addressing reminder based systems have focused largely on the delivery of prompts for a prescribed schedule at fixed times. This is not ideal given that such an approach does not consider what the user is doing and whether the reminder is relevant to them at that specific point in time. Our proposed solution is based upon high-level domain concept reasoning, to account for more complex scenarios. The solution, referred to as iMessenger, addresses the problem of efficient and appropriate delivery of feedback by combining context such as current activity, posture, location, time and personal schedule to manage any inconsistency between what the user is expected to do and what the user is actually doing. The ontology-based context-aware approach has the potential to integrate knowledge and data from different ontology-based repositories. Therefore, iMessenger can utilize a set of potential ontological, context extracting frameworks, to locate, monitor, address and deliver personalized behaviour related feedback, aiding people in the self-management of their well-being.",

For elderly, leaving alone can be tough and risky, typically, a fall can have serious consequences for them. Consequently, smart homes are becoming more and more popular. Such sensors enriched environment can be exploited for health-care applications, in particular Anomaly Detection (AD). Currently, most AD solutions only focus on detecting anomalies in the user daily activities while omitting the ones from the environment itself. For instance the user may have forgotten the pan on the stove while he/she is phoning. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting anomaly occurring in the home environment during user activities: CAREDAS. We propose a combination between ontologies and Markov Logic Network to classify the situations to anomaly classes. Our system is implemented, tested and evaluated using real data obtained from the Hadaptic platform. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.",

The focus of this paper is a 10-class activity recognition problem using motion sensor events over time involving multiple residents and non-scripted activities. This paper presents the results of using three different graph-based approaches to this problem, and compares them to a non-graph SVM approach. The graph-based approaches are generating feature vectors using frequent subgraphs for classification by an SVM, an SVM using a graph kernel and nearest neighbor approach using a graph comparison measure. None demonstrate significantly superior accuracy compared to the non-graph SVM, but all demonstrate strongly uncorrelated error both against the base SVM and each other. An ensemble is created using the non-graph SVM, Frequent Subgraph SVM, Graph Kernel SVM, and Nearest Neighbor. Error is shown to be highly uncorrelated between these four. This ensemble substantially outperforms all of the approaches alone. Results are shown for a 10-class problem arising from smart environments, and a 2-class one-vs-all version of the same problem.",

This knowledge enables the environment to perform more in-depth, human-like analyses of the functioning of observed humans, and to come up with better informed actions. It is discussed which ingredients are important to realise this view, and how frameworks can be developed to combine them to obtain the intended type of systems: coupled reflective human-environment systems. Such systems include computational models by which they are able to model and simulate (parts of) their own behavior. Finally, further perspectives are discussed for Ambient Intelligence applications based on these coupled reflective systems.",

In this paper, we present a study that examines how users conceptualize applications involving automated capture and playback of home activities and reveals a breadth of home applications that people desire. We introduce CAMP, a system that enables end-user programming for smart home environments based on a magnetic poetry metaphor.

abstract="As the number of persons with dementia increases and also the demands on care and support at home, additional solutions to support persons with dementia are needed. The COGKNOW project aims to develop an integrated, user-driven cognitive prosthetic device to help persons with dementia. The project focuses on support in the areas of memory, social contact, daily living activities and feelings of safety. The design process is user-participatory and consists of iterative cycles at three test sites across Europe. In the first cycle persons with dementia and their carers (n = 17) actively participated in the developmental process. Based on their priorities of needs and solutions, on their disabilities and after discussion between the team, a top four list of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions was made and now serves as the basis for development: in the area of remembering -- day and time orientation support, find mobile service and reminding service, in the area of social contact -- telephone support by picture dialling, in the area of daily activities -- media control support through a music playback and radio function, and finally, in the area of safety -- a warning service to indicate when the front door is open and an emergency contact service to enhance feelings of safety. The results of this first project phase show that, in general, the people with mild dementia as well as their carers were able to express and prioritize their (unmet) needs, and the kind of technological assistance they preferred in the selected areas. In next phases it will be tested if the user-participatory design and multidisciplinary approach employed in the COGKNOW project result in a user-friendly, useful device that positively impacts the autonomy and quality of life of persons with dementia and their carers.",

This is as opposed to explicit, where the person must manually answer a question from a questionnaire or enter an observation into a diary. Implicit measurement has an advantage in being able to gather more data, however there is always the issue of to what extent the data gathered is actionable. It is technically possible to measure every step a person takes or to measure every location a person moves to. But what would be done with such data to enable useful health management? Most measurements today mimic what is most effective for acute care, while chronic care or everyday health may be radically different.",

In a social network people with similar diseases and ailments can find each other and share information to improve their understanding of their illness. Group communication tools can help maintain a virtual social network and provide a base for information retrieval. Nevertheless, they often lack the strengths of the social networking tools and vice versa. Within this work we have developed a new concept called dynamic groups. Dynamic groups make creation, management, and usage of groups for communication and social networking easy. Nevetheless, for this to work the profile management system is required to handle more than just user information, it is required to provide users with control over their data and offer privacy and customisation capabilities.

pages="149--163",
abstract="This chapter attempts to foreground the question of migrant labour and their survival in contemporary Kolkata with a study of workers in both `formal' and `informal' sectors of the solid waste management industry. In the age of ecological awareness and hygienic aesthetics, the image of a solitary woman/man sweeping the city streets in the early mornings, carrying the hazardous waste on her/his shoulders, clearing the overflowing litterbins with sharp dexterity produces a strong and darkly ironical visual effect. Apart from these heart-wrenching stories of exploitation and under-appreciation, there are other aspects of the waste disposal industry which deserve attention---especially the institutional details of their participation in the city workforce. In this chapter, the authors look at these issues by exploring work forms and life stories of conservancy workers who have migrated from different parts of the country and have been employed by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, and of homeless rag-pickers who participate in the apparently non-official systems of waste management in the city. Closely looking at a group of `settled migrant' rag-pickers, mostly women, this chapter seeks to understand the time, territory, family structures and the pattern of shifts in occupation taking place in and around a particular dwelling area. Put differently, it explores the relationship between the contingencies of occupation and the question of social reproduction, keeping the question of space alive in the context of a burgeoning rent economy in the city.",

abstract="With advances in technologies, environments and human habitats are all set to become smarter. Such environments, which include smart homes, hospitals, campuses, etc., are oriented towards human comfort and safety. Detecting the presence of a human being in spaces within such environment forms a major challenge. Though there are sensors that can perform this task, they are not without limitations. Using information derived from either single or multiple sensors separately is not sufficient to distinguish human beings from other objects within the environment. Reliable detection of human presence can be achieved only by fusing information obtained from multiple sensors. In this paper, we describe an approach to human presence detection using a combination of PIR and ultrasonic sensors. Analysis is performed based on the received raw signals from the PIR as well as an analog ultrasonic sensor. A voting based approach has been used to classify signals obtained from human beings and non-human objects, thereby facilitating human presence detection. Results obtained from indoor experiments performed using this approach substantiate the viability of its use in real environments.",

The chapter discusses some of the existing agendas for the development of healthy cities and settings, as proposed by WHO and considers the salutogenic model as an option to promote a paradigm shift in the direction of models that produce life and health at the territorial level. The chapter then reflects upon the role that education can play in the development of healthy and sustainable settings and how education can contribute as an emancipatory, health-promoting practice to sustainable development, pointing to some of the connections that need to be constructed within a context of multiple fragmentations of concepts, agendas, sectors, values and power.",

Therefore, potentials were identified about how the data of health care centres may enrich a regional data basis and thereby enhance municipal traffic control systems. In result, existing possibilities and barriers of the preferably sustainable satisfaction of prevailing mobility demands of patients, employees and visitors were assessed with regards to feasibility in terms of mobility supply. Another focus was put on the development of sustainable mobility solutions, which help to reduce emissions and other negative effects of traffic. Besides results of empirical surveys, an architecture for a data- and mobility platform was compiled for implementation.",

Initially, QoL was pursued as an environmental quality to be attained at any price (i.e. regardless of the economic and environmental costs), but more recent conceptions emphasize the need for quality from the standpoint of sustainability, just as much economic as social and environmental. Another aspect evolving over time concerns the factors that affect QoL, i.e. the shift from an almost exclusive emphasis on the ``objective'' socio-economic and environmental conditions to an active and decisive consideration of the subjective, experiential dimension, which inevitably brings us to the study of happiness. However, this displays a bias in operationalization that generates discrepancies, resulting from the methods used to measure happiness. Various instruments are employed, with different focuses and objects of measurement, leading to extremely contradictory and conflicting results. This state of affairs takes on great significance when it comes to making structural and structuring decisions on today's and future society.",

A ``cyberpark'' is defined as a new type of urban landscape where nature and ICTs blend together to generate hybrid experiences and enhance quality of life. The WAY Cyberparks digital tool consists of a smart phone application, server/cloud and web services. Through the experiences from testing it in selected urban open spaces in Barcelona, Lisbon and Ljubljana opportunities are presented and lessons are drawn about relevant aspects of the ICT towards building a more participatory and collaborative process in planning of public spaces. A relevant aspect of the ICT lays in their ability to enhance communication with (potential) users, transforming the production of public open spaces into an interactive process, and enabling creative community participation and empowerment. Furthermore, some challenges of the increasing penetration of digital technologies devices (smart phones, smart watches, tablets, etc.) within the broader context of their use in public urban open spaces such as parks, gardens, squares, plazas are discussed, together with the consequences of this interweaving, which is growing at a rapid pace, unfolds research needs in the future.",

abstract="Healthcare has become a major field of scientific research and is beginning to merge with new technologies to become connected. Measurement of motor activity provides physicians with indicators in order to improve patient follow up. One important health parameter is weight variation. Measuring these variations is not obvious when a person is walking. This paper highlights the difficulty of providing reliable weight variation values with good accuracy. To reach this objective, the paper presents ways to classify the activity of walking, in order to propose a method to measure weight variation at the right time and in a good position. Many methods were studied and compared, using Matlab. We propose a classification tree that uses the standard deviation of acceleration magnitude to define normal walking. The algorithm was embedded in an insole equipped with two force-sensing resistors and tested in laboratory.",

abstract="With the explosion of new information and communication technologies and new devices, these offer increased opportunities to support everyday life but also have increased the requirements on the expected properties such as adaptability to user needs, behavior and particularities. These requirements are even more needed if the user is elderly, disabled or children. Properties like adaptability or learning capability, self-organization can be ensured by using interfaces that copies biological behavior. Thus, uses of Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems can represent key solution for obtaining adaptive interfaces and systems. Modeling such complex systems is some time to computational intensive that's why we have proposed the use of hardware implemented neural networks. Using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) for hardware implementation allows parallel implementation of neurons increasing the processing speed. This paper aims to present the method developed by the authors for implementing artificial neural networks, the results obtained and the possibility of use in some applications experimented by the authors support independent life of elderly people.",

The chapter discusses some of the existing agendas for the development of healthy cities and settings, as proposed by WHO and considers the salutogenic model as an option to promote a paradigm shift in the direction of models that produce life and health at the territorial level. The chapter then reflects upon the role that education can play in the development of healthy and sustainable settings and how education can contribute as an emancipatory, health-promoting practice to sustainable development, pointing to some of the connections that need to be constructed within a context of multiple fragmentations of concepts, agendas, sectors, values and power.",

abstract="Because of the greying society the need of user centred care concepts are raising. One big wish of older persons is to stay as long as possible in their own flat. Depending on the demographic change it won't be possible to realize complete care by formal or informal caregivers especially for people living alone. One possible way to cope this problem is to use ICT based solutions e.g. mobile service robots. The personal in-house mobility and its preservation it is one goal to enable staying as long as possible in her/his own flat. The concept of an automated housing enabling assessment which is presented here is an advanced solution for this problem. It is based on three main components: (1) Measurement and analysis of the cognitive and physical capabilities of the user, (2) Measurement and validation of the flat and (3) Computation of areas with a higher risk to fall and advice to remove such issues, e.g. restructuring of the furniture. The great benefit of a mobile robot platform is that all needed sensors are mounted on the robot and it can follow the user to make measurements at different places in the home. This will reduce the cost and installation effort in the flat to a minimum. Another benefit is the continuous assessment which helps to restructure the flat in a continuous way. This helps to reduce the probability of a fall event and raise the feeling of safety. All measurements could also be used by other assessment tools to preserve the indoor mobility not only by preventing a fall event but also by reacting on changes in the mobility level over time.",

abstract="The global energy system is under stress with volatile oil prices, the challenge of climate change and economic uncertainty bearing down. Now is not the time to pretend that a `business as usual approach' across the Asia Pacific energy sector is a viable strategy which provides resilience. Currently, energy policy is stove piped and sector biased which does not reflect the multifaceted nature of energy. Addressing energy security in vulnerable cities requires a change in thinking. The traditional International Energy Agency (IEA) definition of ``energy security as the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price'', doesn't come close to addressing complex uncertainty. Energy planners in the Asia Pacific must consider the interconnected vulnerabilities of: technological innovation; resource climate management and security; geo-strategic competition; demographic shifts, efficient governance; social cohesion and trust; and hybrid and asymmetric threats. Failure to change the way nations think on energy is a failure to prepare for change.",

In result, existing digital data were specified and checked whether and how they can be used, together with existing open data of the mCloud and other sources, to create an effective steering- and prognosis base for the (digital) control of traffic flows of health care centres. Therefore, potentials were identified about how the data of health care centres may enrich a regional data basis and thereby enhance municipal traffic control systems. In result, existing possibilities and barriers of the preferably sustainable satisfaction of prevailing mobility demands of patients, employees and visitors were assessed with regards to feasibility in terms of mobility supply. Another focus was put on the development of sustainable mobility solutions, which help to reduce emissions and other negative effects of traffic. Besides results of empirical surveys, an architecture for a data- and mobility platform was compiled for implementation.",

This paper explores these applications and the portrayal of people with disabilities within the social robotics discourse. Our review of social robotics literature revealed that social robotics mainly portrays disabled people through a medical/body ability deficiency lens, namely identifying deficient abilities, and then proposing how a certain robot can fix them and give the individual ``normal'' functioning. However, within the Disabled People Rights Movement, the academic field of disability studies, and existing legal documents, a second narrative is evident which focuses less on `fixing' the person to the species-typical norm, and more on increasing the participation in society of that person the way they are. We submit that the second type of narrative and its way of defining problems and solutions needs more visibility within the social robotics discourse and in the vision of possible products.",

This paper proposes an approach with the aim of improving the accuracy and robustness of a location recognition approach based on RFID technology. A method was introduced for the optimal deployment of an RFID reader network, which aims to minimize the hardware cost whilst achieving high localization accuracy. A functional subarea mapping approach was proposed based on both a coarse-grained and a fine-grained method. Experimental results indicated that the coarse-grained mapping provided a higher overall accuracy of location detection. The average subarea location accuracy achieved based on coarse-grained and fine-grained data was 85.4{\%} and 68.7{\%}, respectively. Nevertheless it was found that the fine-grained mapping approach was capable of providing more information in relation to the details of the functional subareas. This implies that we need to balance the requirements between the size of the subareas and the location accuracy.",

We developed a prototype for shoe based activity detection system that uses pressure data of shoe and showed how this can be used for remote monitoring. We also developed a multimodal system where we used pressure sensor data from shoes along with accelerometers and gyroscope data from smart phones to make a robust system. We present the details of our novel activity detection system, its architecture, algorithm and evaluation.",

abstract="User identification in interactive Television (iTV) is an enthusiastic research area that aims to find the most reliable and non-invasive solution allowing viewers to enjoy a truly personalized TV experience. However, usability and efficiency of recognition methods depend upon users' cognitive and psychomotor characteristics, scenario even more complex when elderly viewers are at stake, since they present a great variety of combinations of those parameters. In this framework, the paper depicts the process that led to a methodology to identify the most suited recognition technique to each specific profile of elderly iTV users. The considered recognition methods were associated to an iTV system designed to promote comfort and sociability among elderly.",

abstract="As wireless technologies evolve, mobile technologies and services will increasingly affect our lives, accompanied by positive and negative effects. This development requires a high acceptance of users to the presence of mobile services in various usage contexts. In an exploratory focus-group-interview approach (n = 63), this research investigates usage motives as well as barriers, which are perceived by users of wireless mobile technologies. In order to understand the impact of specific usage contexts, in which mobile services are applied, an ICT context was contrasted to a medical service context. Outcomes show that acceptance factors are neither static nor independent from the specific usage or service context in which a technology is applied. Rather, acceptance reveals to be a product of individual usage motivations, situation-specific evaluations, and individual user profiles.",

We consider the term ``context'' in a broader meaning including presence and location of humans and objects, human behavior, human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction, activities of daily living, etc. We expect that the surrounding environment from which context is gathered is a ``smart environment'', i.e. a space (such as office, house, or public area) equipped with different sets of sensors, including audio and visual perception. Designing the underlying perceptual systems is a non-trivial task which involves interdisciplinary effort dealing with the integration of voice and image recognition technologies, situation modeling middleware, and context-aware interfaces into a robust and self-manageable software framework. To support fast development and tuning of dialog-based services, we introduce a simulation framework compliant with the proposed architecture. The framework is capable of gathering information from a broad set of sensors, of an event-based abstraction of such information, interaction with an integrated dialog system, and of a virtual representation of a smart environment in schematic 2D or realistic 3D projections. We elaborate on use-cases of architecture model referring the two projects where our system was successfully deployed.",

abstract="There is growing interest in the systematic scientific understanding of cities and urbanization due to an increase in data availability about many aspects of urban life throughout the world, as well as ready access to more powerful computation and modeling capabilities. Cities are manifestly complex systems in that social, economic, health and other aspects of urban processes are interconnected in the lives of each urban dweller and depend on the nature of urban services and infrastructure over their built environments. Despite this truism, the modeling of cities as complex systems across all these interdependent dimensions is relatively new. This paper presents a primer to different modeling approaches to cities and urbanization, pointing out their realms of applicability as well as critical areas where they are currently insufficient. Specifically, I give a short introduction to five main traditions---agent-based, spatial equilibrium, contagion, life-course and growth models---and discuss how they are becoming increasingly articulated and interdependent to create more realistic and more predictive models of cities. From this perspective, I summarize a research agenda for urban theory and modeling focused on understanding issues of growth and development across scales of organization from individuals to neighborhoods, cities and urban systems.",

abstract="Previous chapters explained how pervasive computing systems work. As we are secretly hoping you would also like to build such a system, the story would not be complete without an attempt to show you how this is done in real life. We enter now the field of systems engineering, an interdisciplinary, team-based approach that means to enable the realization of successful systems. In a pervasive computing system, software and hardware are working together, in order to enable the desired functionality. For example, a smart car is a system of interconnected sensors (gyroscopes, odometersOdometry, cameras, and LIDARsLIDAR), actuators (displays, speakers, brakes, and motors) and software agentsSoftware agent(map matching, shortest-path planning, traffic light recognition, pedestrians recognition, and automatic cruise control) that work together with other systems (GPS, traffic control systems, and digital map databases), with the purpose of a safe navigation of its passengers to their destination. In many pervasive computing systems, the physical devices, and even some of the software toolboxes, are ready-made. Therefore, the main challenge consists of developing the complete software application and integrating it with the existing hardware. This is why the main focus in this chapter will be on software. Software is nowadays the product of a team of software engineers. The first thing this software team does is, not as you might think, directly jump into programming. The team first writes down what the product should do, who and how will use it, how much time it will take to build it, what is its architecture, how it will be tested, what can go wrong, etc. This disciplined, engineering-like approach of ``making'' software, called software engineeringSoftware engineering, is proved to increase the project success and is benefic when it comes to maintainability and accidentAccidentsanalysis. Software engineering is thus a part of system engineeringSystem engineering, concerned with all aspects of software production, from system specification to maintenance. This chapter highlights the best practices in system engineering in general, and in software development process, in particular.",

The main utility is supporting the development of large annotated datasets, which is essential for the development and evaluation of context-aware models to interpret and monitor occupant behaviour within smart environments. DANTE only records scenes during which `tagged' objects are interacted with therefore significantly reducing the amount of redundant footage recorded. The current study has extended the concepts of DANTE and has used it to support the annotation of additional sensor platforms. Results demonstrated both the capability of DANTE to support annotation of other platforms along with reducing the amount of time previously required to manually annotate such data by more than 45{\%}.",

abstract="This chapter presents the current situation as regards Transport research and innovation in the Republic of Korea (South Korea or simply Korea) with special emphasis on the policies, capacity and general prospects for more international cooperation in this area. It also gives a basic understanding of the overall Research Technological Development and Innovation (RTD{\&}I) system in this country and discusses the obstacles and challenges that Korea faces in maintaining this system as one of the most advanced in the world. It shows the policies and other activities that this country is pursuing in RTD{\&}I in order to strengthen its national competitiveness and to increase its international technological stature in addressing shared global issues and challenges and providing technological assistance to developing countries. In focusing also on the field of Transport the chapter gives particular attention to the so called Land, Infrastructure and Transport RTD{\&}I (LIT/RTD{\&}I) which the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) has developed and is pushing forward as a tool to pursue national new growth engines in the field of Transport. Korea's international cooperation policies in RTD{\&}I are mainly carried out through specific projects which are funded and supervised by various individual governmental agencies. In relation to these policies the chapter also includes a SWOT analysis of the Korean RTD{\&}I prospects for increased future international cooperation and their focus in the field of Transport. Among the measures recommended to strengthen its current capacities and implement further its international cooperation capabilities in the land, infrastructure and transport areas (LIT/RTD{\&}I) are, the rebuilding of the current classification structure applicable to international RTD{\&}I work; development of more systematic investment plans to address specific investment strategies for international collaboration in RTD{\&}I; establishing a system to share information between government organizations and government-funded research institutes active in international RTD{\&}I collaboration in the land, infrastructure and transport areas; and developing specific RTD{\&}I strategies for individual partner countries considering their unique conditions, their level of development and geopolitical location.",

We also present a model of people's use of space in the home, identifying a small set of favored places of long-term use and a larger set of kinetic places used for specific tasks. We discuss how the factors we have identified generally promote use of laptops in favored places and generally discourage use of laptops in kinetic places.

One particular application that has benefitted from this technology is the remote monitoring and management of cardiovascular conditions. In this paper, details of an investigation considering the impact of everyday activities on heart rate are presented. ECG and accelerometer signals collected from wearable wireless sensors have been utilized to investigate the underlying relationships between physiological and activity-related profile information. The impact of activities on heart rate has been captured through analysis of the patterns of heart rate using the CUSUM algorithm. Subsequently, results have shown that a change in the pattern of heart rate is detected shortly after an activity commences. Further extensions of the research are also proposed, including integration of a range of ECG features and intelligent data analysis techniques, thereby facilitating the future development of context aware health monitoring mechanisms.",

abstract="Increasing care needs represent major challenges for today's care sectors. Developing assistive technologies such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems pose a potential approach to face these challenges by relieving care staff or facilitating everyday life, e.g., for people with disabilities. Thereby, acceptance is essential for a sustainable adoption of assistive technologies in real life. So far, research has focused on technology-related as well as demographic factors and persons' attitudes (e.g., technical self-efficacy) impacting technology acceptance. In contrast, individual attitudes towards the own situation - in particular individual attitudes towards care -- have not been considered as potential influencing factors on the acceptance of assistive technologies. In order to create an appropriate measuring instrument for attitudes towards care, two empirical studies were carried out: In an online survey study (n = 34) persons' attitudes towards the own care situation and their relationships to attitudes towards usage of assistive technologies were studied out of the perspective of people with disabilities. The exploratory confirmed instrument ``attitudes towards care'' was related with acceptance and perception of assistive technologies focusing on people of different ages with physical disabilities. Results of the second study (n = 64) verified these relationships focusing on elderly people in need of care. This suggests that attitudes towards care are acceptance-relevant for diverse groups of people. The results can be used to investigate relationships between individual perceptions of care and (assistive) technology acceptance in detail and to refine and adapt the attitude towards care instrument for diverse user groups.",

abstract="The acceptance of novel technology is one if not the most decisive component of the success of the technology rollout. Though, acceptance criteria differ not only across the diversity of users, but might also differ across the different usage context. This is especially valid for technologies in the health and beauty context, in which the balance between pro-using arguments and contra-using arguments is especially fragile. This paper focuses on the impact of the context towards the motivation to use an invasive technology. A survey was conducted in which 170 participants of a wide age range (17-89 years) took part. In the study, three different usage scenarios were presented (medical scenario, preventative healthcare scenario and beauty scenario). After an introduction into each scenario the participants had to evaluate usage motives and barriers. The results corroborated the impact of the situational context and the dependency of acceptance outcomes on the reasons for which technology might be used. Overall, acceptance was highest for medical technology and lowest for the beauty context. Considering the single reasons for or against the technology, we find that nature and weighing of perceived barriers and concerns are quite similar, independently of the context.",

The fused context information is logged using ontological representation in Life Log deployed on cloud server. On top of the Life Log, behavior analysis and prediction services are developed to analyze the behavior of the patient and provide better healthcare, wellness, and behavior prediction services.

abstract="Owing to the massive amount of video data being generated as a result of high proliferation of surveillance cameras, the manpower to monitor such system is relatively expensive. Passively monitoring surveillance video however, incapacitates the usefulness of surveillance camera. Therefore, a drive to monitor events as they happen is expedient to fully harness the massive data generated by surveillance cameras. This is the main goal of video analytics. In this chapter, we extend the notion of surveillance. Surveillance refers not only to monitoring for security or safety purposes but encapsulates all aspects of monitoring to capture the dynamics of different application domains including retail, transportation, service industries and healthcare. This chapter presents a detailed survey of video analytics as well as its application. We present advances in video analytics research and emerging trends from subdomains such as behavior analysis, moving object classification, video summarization, object detection, object tracking, congestion analysis, abnormality detection and information fusion from multiple cameras. We also summarize recent development in video analytics and intelligent video systems (IVS). We evaluated the state-of-the-art approach to video analytics including deep learning approach and outlined research direction with emphasis on algorithm-based analytics and applications. Hardware-related issues are excluded from this chapter.",

abstract="Advances in medical science allow people to live longer and more independently than some decades ago. However, this does not directly help older adults improve their mental wellbeing. Several studies show that elderly people usually suffer from some level of social isolation that negatively impacts on their physical and mental conditions. As a way to address such a problem, this paper presents Visitrack, a pervasive and unobtrusive service conceived to monitor the social activity of older adults living at home. Based on sensing data retrieved and processed by the system, it can take several actions. For instance, informing family members and friends about long periods with no social activity at the older adult's home. The proposed service has been evaluated through a controlled experimental study, obtaining highly accurate results.",

abstract="A ubiquitous environment allows the system to infer the users' needs and preferences, making adaptations to the interface. However, the best way to make such adaptations is still under debate by researchers. This paper proposes an architecture that supports the adaptation of user interfaces in ubiquitous environments according to the users' profiles. The proposed architecture is shown simple and low cost, has low implementation complexity and high extension capability. The user profile data are stored on the user's mobile device for privacy. As the profile is defined by the user, it is expected that the interface adaptation occurs more accurately. A prototype is presented as a proof of concept.",

abstract="Sensor technologies can enable independent living for people with dementia by monitoring their behaviour and identifying points where support may be required. Wearable sensors can provide such support but may constitute a source of stigma for the user if they are perceived as visible and therefore obtrusive. This paper presents an initial empirical investigation exploring the extent to which wearable sensors are perceived as visible. 23 Participants wore eye tracking glasses, which superimposed the location of their gaze onto video data of their panorama. Participants were led to believe that the research entailed a subjective evaluation of the eye tracking glasses. A researcher wore one of two wearable sensors during the evaluation enabling us to measure the extent to which participants fixated on the sensor during a one-on-one meeting. Results are presented on the general visibility and potential fixations on two wearable sensors, a wrist-work actigraph and a lifelogging camera, during normal conversation between two people. Further investigation is merited according to the results of this pilot study.",

The proposed robotic computer consists of a control unit and an agent unit. The control unit, which is a remote processing server connected to the host server of the smart environment, provides memory (high-level information) and processing (computing resources) capabilities to the agent unit. The agent unit is a portable device which is wirelessly connected to the control unit, and interacts with users and physical objects.

abstract="Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory, and its associated Dempster rule of combination, has been widely used to determine belief based on uncertain evidence sources. Variations to the original Dempster rule of combination have appeared in the literature to support particular scenarios where unreliable results may result from the use of original DS theory. While theoretical explanations of the rule variations are explained, there is a lack of empirical comparisons of the DS theory and its variations against real data sets. In this work, we examine several variations to DS theory. Using two real-world sensor data sets, we compare the performance of DS theory and several of its variations in recognising situations. The empirical results shed insight on how to select these fusion rules based on the nature of sensor data, the relationship of this data over time to the higher level hypotheses and the choice of frame of discernment.",

Trends in demographics, computer science and wireless world-circling communication portend an increasing reliance of the healthcare sector on therapy models that are consumer-driven and technology-dependent. The consumer will be at the information hub, especially in high-cost, long-duration healthcare interventions, such as those commonly found in rehabilitation, since a smaller amount of financial investment will be expected to deliver more in terms of functional outcomes. People will use computer-controlled devices like robots in assistive or exercise functions in individualized, socially embedded scenarios. Reliable sensors, adaptive motion control and robust data analysis software will change the landscape of rehabilitation practice. In the coming years, the field of robotics will be a key component to enhancing the quality of rehabilitative care and improving the communication between patient and clinical professional.",

The analysis draws on our review of more than 70 AmI projects, principally in Europe. It notes the visions as well as the specifics of typical AmI scenarios. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis, not least of which is that most AmI scenarios depict a rather too sunny view of our technological future. Finally, reference is made to the SWAMI project (Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence) which, inter alia, has constructed ''dark'' scenarios, as we term them, to show how things can go wrong in AmI and where safeguards are needed.",

abstract="In previous works overall activity and inactivity levels of users living in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) enabled flats were determined using standard home automation sensors. The flats are regular dwellings for long-term use by approximately 30 tenants located in Kaiserslautern, Germany. In this real-world AAL project it was shown that basic inactivity alarms based on linear thresholds can be triggered within 30 to 180 minutes after the occurrence of a potential emergency. However, inactivity alarms are somewhat coarse and do not make full use of additional information inherent in the raw sensor data: spatial and temporal information regarding the location of a tenant in their flat and the time spent in a room. Using that information, it can be determined in which room a tenant has resided for how long at a given time. Hence, in this paper a method for location tracking is proposed, forming a novel alarming criterion.",

abstract="The use of information and communication technologies in the healthcare industry has been referred to as ``telemedicine'' or ``e-health.'' Our healthcare systems are facing big increases in demand due to growing elderly populations, rising chronic diseases, and the rapid development of new treatments; thus, the use of telemedicine is believed to be a part of the solution in restructuring and redesigning our healthcare systems. Despite often positive results, many telemedicine services remain stuck in a pilot or experimental phase and never make it to a larger implementation. The most important obstacle is the lack of structural financial reimbursement and available budget. In The Netherlands, we have developed and successfully applied our Health Management Practice (HMP) Model on a large number of telemedicine services using the ``start small, think big'' approach, leading to fully integrated telemedicine services. Results show a 70--96{\%} reduction in hospital visits in dermatology and ophthalmology, which translates into an immediate cost reduction of 18{\%}. Response times of 4--5 working hours and the learning effect have a high impact on the quality of care delivered. Telemonitoring programs in mental health have shown that involving the patient as an active actor can result in more motivation and ownership of their own health. Telemedicine also allows hospitals to remain focused on delivering high-quality specialized care. In many peripheral centers in residential areas, more routine care services will be delivered close to the patient by paramedics, caregivers, and patients themselves under the direction and supervision of a general practitioner and medical specialist at a distance.",

Recent development of wireless and mobile technology (Agrawal and Zeng, 2003; Delin and Jackson, 2000; Hsu at al., 1998; Priddy and Jovanov, 2004) laid a foundation for the new generation of wireless intelligent sensors (DARPA, 2004; NIST, 2004). The same technology made feasible implementation of intelligent medical monitors that can provide real-time feedback to the patient, either as a warning of impending medical emergency or as a monitoring aid during exercise. Intelligent medical monitors can significantly decrease the number of hospitalizations and nursing visits (Heidenreich, 1999), acting as a personal ``guardian angel'' as proposed by Gordon Bell (Morse, 1997).

By extension, we show that intelligent furniture can be designed through ICT and home automation to assist persons with cognitive troubles or motor disability. Finally, we describe the application done in a dare care center for persons with cognitive troubles. Colors of the rooms have been chosen to allow the patients to naturally identify the role of each room.",

abstract="Nowadays, filtering and analyzing data coming from Tele* (i.e. telemedicine, telerehabiliation, telemonitoring, telecare, and teleassistance) systems is becoming more and more relevant. In fact, those systems gather a lot of data coming from patients through wearable, domotic, and environmental sensors, as well as questionnaires and interviews. The role of therapists and care givers is essential for remotely assisting the corresponding patients. Thus, intelligent solutions able to understand all those data and process them to keep therapists and caregivers aware about their assisted persons are needed. Moreover, friendly and useful tools for accessing and visualizing those data must be provided to therapists and caregivers. In this chapter, we present a generic Tele* solution that, in principle, may be customized to whatever kind of real scenarios to give a continuous and efficient support to therapists and caregivers. The aim of the proposed solution is to be as flexible as possible in order to be able to provide telerehabilitation, telemonitoring, teleassistance or a conjunction of them, depending on the real situation. Three customizations of the generic platform are also presented.",

Five senior users of above 65 years old who never use home-use glucose meters before were recruited to operate typical tasks: a. changing lancet, b. inserting a strip to turn on the meter, c. lancing, d. waiting for the result and e. discarding lancet. The experiment process was recorded for further interview. The results demonstrated that the key factors that caused operation errors were found on lancing device and test strip instead of the glucose meter.

abstract="This article reports on the issue of arrangement of public services. We argue that public services offered together in one building are often combined without consideration of citizens' needs. It is not unusual for services to be arranged only according to organizational charts of public administration bodies or space availability. Thus we postulate a shift of perspective from administration-centered to user-centered approach that should be applied in the public administration in general and in public services in particular. To this end we propose a method for decision support on user-centered arrangements of public services. The method is a planning and evaluation tool based on feature modelling. It makes it possible to describe services from the user perspective and compare them in terms of their advantageous arrangement in a facility building. The method has been tested on a real case study and the results are presented and discussed.",

Coastal cities themselves are important direct and indirect sources of new employment, the first factor of social integration, followed by housing and education. The enhancement of urban social capital is of increasing importance in cities that face new forms of unemployment, poverty and exclusion, where more than three generations co-exist, and immigrants also come from the sea in search of better opportunities on a blue horizon.

This study compares the openness to accept medical technology in Germany, Poland and Turkey. 300 respondents (19-85 years, 56{\%} women, 38{\%} chronically ill) participated in a survey, in which the pros and cons for using medical technologies were examined as well as the underlying acceptance motives and utilization barriers. The effects of different cultures, but also of age, gender and health status were analyzed regarding their impact on acceptance patterns. Results reveal both, culturally insensitive as well culturally sensitive acceptance, with strong effects of gender and exercising frequency.

Due to shortage of qualified caregivers, automatic detection of the situation in a bedroom is desirable since risks may arise when an elder gets up from the bed alone. In addition, analyzing the total amount of care time of an elder is helpful when the social effect on the improvement of the elder's health needs to be evaluated. This paper presents a context-aware healthcare system which makes use of multi-modal and un-obtrusive sensing technology meanwhile taking human feeling into account. Specifically, we choose ambient sensors such as pressure straps and a laser scanner to monitor both the activity of the elder and his/her surroundings. Moreover, a context fusion is further proposed to infer the situation of the elder. Experimental results demonstrate the high promise of our proposed methods for bed-related situation awareness.",

abstract="The world is urbanizing fast and climate change impacts are already being felt in urban agglomerations across the globe. The United Nations Report has projected that India will add 404 million urban inhabitants by 2050 (World Urbanization Prospects 2014). Because of high population densities and increased industrial activities, cities contribute to climate change and also face serious risks due to impacts of climate change. Being engines of growth, cities are a hub of economic centres, thus, economic losses due to climate changes are expected to be significantly high in urban areas making them extremely vulnerable to disasters. In spite of growing evidence of climate change impacts on Indian cities, both the state authorities and the civic bodies are unable to wed urban planning exercise with environmental planning. Current plans and policies are not holistic, and fail to meet the future escalating demands of urban population and possible urban disasters. This paper explores these issues through two case studies of Indian megacities---Bengaluru in Karnataka and Mumbai in Maharashtra. Former focuses on problems faced by urban residential communities located in low-lying areas of the city. Poor urban planning and mindless construction mania has accentuated cases of urban flooding in Bengaluru. The second case study of Mumbai looks at the July 2005 floods when the entire metropolis was marooned due to unprecedented heavy rainfall. It puts in perspective various scientific studies that show impacts of climate change in Mumbai and the associated risks. Both the cases re-emphasise the fact that urban planning is not a top-to-down approach and it cannot be done undertaken in isolation. In wake of growing evidence of climate change impacts in urban areas, it is imperative that a holistic ``environmental urban planning'' is undertaken to help Indian cities adapt to climate change.",

If, for example, an elderly person falls and cannot call for help independently, it often takes hours or even days until the emergency is noticed and assistance will be provided. The presented video monitoring system is to mitigate situations of this kind. If an emergency is detected, an automatic alarm will be raised. One of the main aspects of the developed assistance system is to be as unobtrusive as possible to achieve a high acceptance among the users. Moreover, the system needs to work very robustly in individual home environments. The fall detection system is part of an extensive real-life Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) concept with many other extended support functions.",

abstract="Alzheimer's disease can severely impair the independent lifestyle of a person. Dem@Care is an European research project that conducted a study for timely diagnosis of Alzheimers disease by collecting everyday motion data from couples (or dyads), with one of the person in the couple having AD. Their results suggest that AD can be detected using everyday motion data from accelerometers. They did evaluation based on leave-one-person-out cross-validation. However, this evaluation can introduce bias in the classification results because one of the person from the dyad is present in the training set while the other is being tested. In this paper, we revisit the Dem@Care study and propose a new evaluation method that performs leave one-dyad-out cross-validation to remove the dataset selection bias. We then introduce new domain specific features based on dynamic and static intervals of motions that significantly improves the classification results. We further show increase in performance by combining the proposed features with new time, frequency domain and baseline features used in the Dem@Care study.",

abstract="In this paper, we describe a human posture classification and a falling detector module suitable for smart homes and assisted living solutions. The system uses a neural network that processes the human joints produced by a skeleton tracker using the depth streams of an RGB-D sensor. The neural network is able to recognize standing, sitting and lying postures. Using only the depth maps from the sensor, the system can work in poor light conditions and guarantees the privacy of the person. The neural network is trained with a dataset produced with the Kinect tracker, but it is also tested with a different human tracker (NiTE). In particular, the aim of this work is to analyse the behaviour of the neural network even when the position of the extracted joints is not reliable and the provided skeleton is confused. Real-time tests have been carried out covering the whole operative range of the sensor (up to 3.5 m). Experimental results have shown an overall accuracy of 98.3{\%} using the NiTE tracker for the falling tests, with the worst accuracy of 97.5{\%}.",

abstract="The AAL Systems have been devised to monitor the life of persons in their home, in order to infer information on their state of health and to support their wellbeing. The achievement of this purpose is possible by means of various technologies and systems (such as, for instance, home environment sensors, personal sensors and clinical devices). This article describes the design and early development of a software tool, that allows to control an AAL System, completely based on an ontological approach. From this innovative point of view, an ontological formalization is used to describe a domain and to implement an automatic reason. This approach provides a dynamic model that can change its state and expand accordingly to rules that are also a part of the model. Such a description is continually updated with information provided by the AAL System database that reports the significant events recorded by the sensors. Then, exploiting the potential of an OWL-DL reasoner, decisions about the feedbacks that the System have to activate, are inferred.",

Especially device miniaturization is enormously progressing what makes implantable technology to a promising approach for the future. Especially in times of the demographic change implantable medical technology could play its part in the delivery of healthcare services, supporting an independent and mobile aging. From a technical point of view, implants are far-developed and will enter the market in the next years. From a human factors' point of view, there is a considerable lack of acceptance-related knowledge and understanding of perceived benefits and barriers across a diverse population. Using a qualitative approach, this study gains insights into public perceptions of implantable medical technology, the level of information revealing misconceptions and basic fears. It thus explores cognitive and affective factors that form the acceptance of implantable medical technology. Results allow the identification of information and technical communication deficits in order to derive a sensitive information and communication policy.",

At the level of the user interface, this will allow the personalization and the adaptation based on user's requirements. Service provision has to be effective and performed according to current context particularly when focusing on people with special needs. The proposed Service Model (SM) supports the diversity of existing pervasive services and their content, the personalization and adaptation to both user and device profile, and the context-aware discovery in visited environment. The SM is composed of three main parts: Service Profile describing what a service can do, Service Interface describing how a service should be used and Service Logic Code dealing program code and internal functionalities of the service.",

Incorporating vision devices in private settings is justified by its power to extract large amounts of data with low cost but must safeguard the privacy of individuals. The vision system we have designed incorporates a knowledge base containing information from the environment, parameters of different cameras used, human behavior modeling and recognition, and information about people and objects. By analyzing the scene, we infer its context, and provide a privacy filter which is able to return textual information, as well as synthetic and real images.",

abstract="Owing to ambient intelligence and context awareness in nowadays environments, the provided services become more pervasive and personalized according to the user's profile. With the growing healthcare and wellbeing context aware applications, modeling security policies become an important issue in the design of future access control models. This requires rich semantics using ontology modeling for the management of services provided to dependant people. However, current access control models remain unsuitable due to lack of completeness, flexibility and adaptability to the user capability and behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptable access control model (UBC-ACM) and its related architecture (UBC-ACA) in which the security policy is based on the user's behavior and capability to grant a service using any assistive device within intelligent environment. The design of our model is an ontology-learning and evolving security policy for predicting the future actions of dependent people. This is reached by analyzing historical data, contextual data, and user behavior according to the access rules that are used in the inference engine to provide the right service according to the needs of users.",

abstract="Lifestyle and risk factors affect the development of diseases, cognitive decline and loss of autonomy during ageing. In the Italian Smart Health 2.0 project, we developed the SmartAging program offering innovative ICT solutions, grounded upon the Italian Telecom platform (``Nuvola Italian Home Doctor''), to contrast cognitive decline and support ``active'' ageing. Specifically, the SmartAging program includes tools for daily telemonitoring at subjects' home of: (i) eating behaviour, (ii) physical exercise, (iii) tobacco consumption, (iv) cultural, social and relational activities, (v) cognitive functions, (vi) weight, temperature, and blood pressure. Furthermore, a Point of Care device and a Self-Assessment Health Station (i.e. health medical equipment), in proximity to the subjects' home, allowed periodic measures of blood biomarkers and physiological indices. To demonstrate the feasibility of this program, we performed a clinical proof of concept study for 16 weeks on 10 elderly subjects (5 being oncological long-term survivors). All subjects expressed a need for education and assistance concerning a healthy lifestyle. Most of them expressed a preference for ICT-based home programs to improve the lifestyle over institutional programs. All expressed satisfaction with the SmartAging program in terms of simplicity, clarity, adequacy and reported a positive impact on their quality of life. These results suggest that the SmartAging program fulfills all the requirements to be considered an innovative technological approach for the lifestyle education and telemonitoring of seniors, to prevent dementing disorders. Some concepts of the SmartAging program have been further developing in the H2020-MSCA-ITN-ETN BBDiag project.",

Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote socialization in shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. In order to understand socializations in these shared spaces, surveillance systems must be developed to quantify the number and type of interactions in an environment. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using multiple cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an automatic behavioral mapping surveillance system designed for monitoring interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. Specific emphasis is given to the system designed to monitor the number, length and type of interactions of older adults in the community.",

abstract="In this manuscript, a case study is conducted on bio-signals of timevarying spectral content with the purpose of developing a quality of life engineering product. The study deals with noise reduction of electrocardiogram (ECG) for detecting abnormality of the heart system during daily life. Instantaneous bandwidth (IB) of ECG is estimated and is used adaptively as IB of variable bandwidth filter (VBF) for suppressing noise whose Fourier spectrum overlaps with that of ECG and estimating more accurately parameters such as onsets, ends, rates, intervals and durations on the six principal waves of ECG measured during daily life. The proposed method based on the VBF improves the SNR on the P, Q and T waves without damaging the QRS complex, different from, the methods based on the Fourier spectral analysis.",

The traditional human detection and response systems always depend on some special devices, so that the prices of such systems are quite expensive. Considering that the widely-used smart phones are embedded many sensors, they provide a new way to construct a low-cost motion detection and response system. In this paper, a new architecture of the motion detection and response system is proposed based on smart phones, and the methods for detecting the human motion and responding accordingly are also given. Comparing with the traditional systems, the newly-proposed motion detection system is server-free and does not require any special devices.

abstract="Medical researchers are constantly looking for new methods for early detection and treatment of incurable diseases. Cancer can severely hinder the lives of patients if they are not constantly attended to. Cancer patients can be assisted with the aid of constant monitoring by a support group and a continual sense of self-awareness through monitoring, which can be enabled through pervasive technologies. As human life expectancy rises, incidents of cancer also increase, which most often affects the elderly. Cancer patients need continuous follow-up because of the state of their disease and the intensity of treatment. Patients have often restricted mobility, thus it is helpful to provide them access to their health status without the need to travel. There has been much effort towards wireless and internet based health care services, but they are not widely accepted due to the lack of reliability and usability. In this paper, we present a software called Wellness Monitor (WM). The purpose of WM is to utilize the portability and ubiquity of small handheld devices such as PDAs, cell phones, and wrist watches to ensure secured data availability, customized representation, and privacy of the data collected through small wearable sensors. WM explores how the social and psychological contexts that encompass the patients could be enhanced by utilizing the same technology, an aspect which is mostly unexplored. A further goal was to provide continuous psychological assistance.",

Moreover, these plans need to be adapted in a sensitive and responsive way to both the natural disease evolution and unexpected circumstances. This work presents an approach to automatically generate (from formal CPGs) and adaptively execute daily living care plans in the frame of a planning-based distributed architecture that allows for its application on AmI environments.

abstract="The aging process typically requires personalized care services for each individual. In this context, a collaborative elderly care ecosystem can support the provision of integrated services that may combine contributions from multiple providers. Through composition of services a personalized solution, tailored to the individual customer, respecting her/his requests, preferences, lifestyle, and constraints, can be achieved. An additional issue the ecosystem must deal with is the problem of evolution, as individual's care needs are not static over time. Consequently, the care services need to evolve accordingly to keep the elderly's requirements satisfied. This process of services' adaptation is challenging since many services can be dependent on each other, and there are various constraints that need to be observed before adaptating and enacting new services. In this paper, we exploit socio-technical aspects of service adaptation in the context of elderly care ecosystems. Starting with a service personalization method previously proposed, we introduce various cases of evolution of elderly care services in response to new requirements. The method considers customer's inputs and suggests evolution plans based on the MAPE-K methodology. An application example is then introduced to illustrate the approach.",

abstract="The multi-sensor fusion can provide more accurate and reliable information compared to information from each sensor separately taken. Moreover, the data from multiple heterogeneous sensors present in the medical surveillance systems have different degrees of uncertainty. Among multi-sensor data fusion techniques, Bayesian methods and evidence theories such as Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), are commonly used to handle the degree of uncertainty in the fusion processes. Based on a graphic representation of the DST called evidential networks, we propose a structure of heterogeneous multi-sensor fusion for falls detection. The proposed Evidential Network (EN) can handle the uncertainty present in a mobile and a fixed sensor-based remote monitoring systems (fall detection) by fusing them and therefore increasing the fall detection sensitivity compared to the a separated alone system.",

Early detection of behavior change is major enabler for service providers to adapt their services and improve the quality of life of elderly people. Nowadays, existing psychogeriatric scales and questionnaires are insufficient to observe all possible changes at a daily basis. Therefore, we propose a technological approach for behavior change detection, that employs unobtrusive ambient technologies to follow up elderly people over long periods. In fact, we study significant behavior change indicators (e.g., sleep impairments, visits and go out) and investigate statistical techniques that distinguish transient and continuous changes in monitored behavior. Furthermore, we present a preliminary validation of our approach through results based on correlations between our technological observations and medical observations of two-year nursing home deployment.",

abstract="Who wants to live forever? Can one extend life by slowing or reversing the process of ageing? How realistic is it to achieve immortality---materially or virtually? Is it feasible to bank one's genome or store one's stem cells in order to regenerate one's self in the future? With recent developments in human genome sequencing, stem cell science, the biology of ageing, neuroscience, and information science, such questions, until recently considered highly speculative and within the realm of science fiction, increasingly seem reasonable and worth asking. Indeed, some entrepreneurs are already seeking to capitalise on the promise of being able to reverse or delay ageing, extend life, or achieve immortality. And, in many cases, these entrepreneurs are either scientists who work in the field of anti-ageing research or venture capitalists with strong links with scientists and other experts who share a commitment to their goals. Aubrey de Grey, chief science officer and co-founder of the Sens Research Foundation, an organisation devoted to building a regenerative medicine industry, argues that biological ageing is a disease that can, given the technological means, be eventually `cured'. De Grey, who contributes regularly to public events such as the TED talks and various other media platforms, is an articulate advocate of the life extension project.",

Ageing diseases in an early stage have an impact on measurable behaviours like sleeping times and quality, consistency of activity sequences and gait characteristics. Unfortunately, these interesting parameters of daily routine are hard to assess. In this work a technical system is proposed that is capable of detecting those changes in indoor daily routine automatically, unobtrusively and over long periods of time. The system relies on a combination of various sensors, including a novel capacitance sensing system covering large areas in the home environment, that is capable of detecting the locations of persons. A processing scheme is proposed to extract behavioural information from the sensor data, which is fed into a learning algorithm that internally represents typical patterns, and outputs a measure for the divergence of current behaviour from typical behaviour. As a noticeable feature, no interaction with the patient is required.",

abstract="Spanish population over 65 years old will soon be an important fraction. These data show the need for some helping technologies that make possible to deal with this scenario. This research aims to explore Ambient Intelligence and Semantic Web technologies to allow personal health monitoring and user interactions at home as transparent as possible. To achieve this goal a Multi-Agent System is proposed, focusing on knowledge representation. The ontology has been defined according to current standards in order to improve the interoperability of the whole system, and its possible communications with other external systems. Furthermore, the defined language supports the semantic reasoning process for agent's real time decision making according to changing circumstances. This proposal can be understood as a step forward patient experience, in the sense of how environment information and user`s behaviors are taken into account to provide and manage suitable services.",

Next, the chapter focuses on a discussion of design work in providing accessible documents to deliver accessible educational materials to students, matched to their needs and the capabilities of the device that they are using, so modelling components need to be considered. Next is a presentation of user models supporting the diagnosis of cognitive states, employing a user model that is expressed as fusion of sensor data. With a baseline created, the system captures sensor data over time and compares it with `normal' pattern, to identify indications of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Finally, a novel framework for User Models design is shown, dividing user data into static and dynamic types.",

We begin by noting that US cities face a significant challenge in overcoming automobile dependence as they seek to create more sustainability transportation options. We explore the challenges of deteriorating transportation infrastructure in the face of reduced government support and funding. We then examine how cities are beginning to rethink urban design and to support efforts to create more diverse, sustainable transportation, such as car and bikeshares. Transit-oriented development is a major trend in planning that holds the promise to reduce the need for automobile in cities. We also examine ways that cities link transportation to climate change and economics. We then examine how cities are taking action to reduce emissions that contribute to both climate change and localized air pollution. Finally we explore ways that cities are implementing programs designed to increase fuel-efficient transportation.",

abstract="The purpose of the chapter is to analyse variations in local policy autonomy across countries and over time. Policy autonomy refers to the tasks that local authorities perform and the discretion they enjoy in the performance of those tasks. Policy autonomy is at the heart of local democracy as it sets the range of policy choice open to the elected representatives serving on local councils and therefore also the potential range of political choices presented to local voters. Policy choices drive political competition and accountability. Policy autonomy has increased over the time period analysed here in most of the countries included in the study. In some countries, the increase is rather marginal; in other countries policy autonomy has grown substantially. Nevertheless, the most remarkable finding is the range over variation in policy autonomy still existing across European countries, with the Nordic countries leading in terms of policy autonomy while Black Sea countries lag behind. This contrast has persisted throughout the period. The chapter analyses, furthermore, policy autonomy in detail, policy by policy. European countries also vary as regards the range of functions allocated to local government as well as the amount of discretion granted in performing the respective functions. The functional variation across countries suggests that the development of local policy autonomy in European countries follows distinctly national trajectories.",

Despite many efforts made to get market data from major stakeholders, all efforts proved fruitless. In that respect, a survey was conducted for the analysis. Four key components of features are embedded in our analysis -- namely, environmental, intrinsic, neighbourhood and owners' characteristics. A rigorous and comprehensive analysis was undertaken by estimating quantile regressions based on bootstrapped standard errors to generate reliable results. Robust effects are noted in the cases of land value, the number of bathrooms, the number of toilets, the presence of swimming pool and district belongingness. Based on the conclusions obtained, a weighted house price index which incorporate distinct metrics, is being proposed. Policy-wise, different stakeholders can use our index to ensure proper house pricing, let alone cushioning borrowers from malpractices.",

But corporate social responsibility and a commitment to positive social impact are not just check box items, or add-ons to the work at Whirlpool Corporation, the world's largest major home appliance manufacturer, headquartered in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Since 2000, Whirlpool's work as a catalyst for economic development in its hometown, and as a consumer-focused partner to organizations like Habitat for Humanity, has become core to its business strategy. Whirlpool engaged in a strategic innovation effort to understand genuine customer needs in order to create breakthrough products that would cultivate long-term customer loyalty. Simultaneously, Whirlpool Corporation engaged with community partners, state and local government, and employees to understand and improve the economic conditions of Benton Harbor, Michigan. This chapter analyzes how an intensive focus on helping families has played an integral role in how Whirlpool designs products, models innovation, and recruits new talent. With customers as the focus and innovation as the method, Whirlpool undertook to transform its business for long-term success. In the process, it discovered the power of purpose-driven engagement with employees, customers, and its community.",

Lifetime is considered in different contexts i.e. some considered network lifetime when first node dies or some percentage of nodes dies or when all the nodes deplete their energy. In WSN, energy conservation becomes important to improve network lifetime. In a network with even distribution of nodes, nodes that lie near the base station deplete their energy faster and hole is created which leads to disconnected network. Incorporating Heterogeneity in the network increases energy efficiency and improves network lifetime. Heterogeneity is included in terms of energy, links and computational resources. Finding optimal number and positions of Heterogeneous nodes to improve network performance is the main concern of this study.",

Considering these premises, the automated control of electronic devices through mobile devices has emerged as a new challenge, whose main goal is to improve the quality of life of people. In this work, we present HomeR, a system that allows people, including people with disabilities, to manage smart home appliances through a mobile application.

The game is set in a retirement village, where residents live in smart homes equipped with monitoring systems. Players, who ``work'' in the village, need to trade-off the time spent on administrative tasks (which enable them to earn extra income) against the time spent ensuring the welfare of the residents. The scenario of the game is complex enough to support the investigation of the influence of various factors, such as system accuracy, type of error made by the system, and risk associated with events, on players' trust in the monitoring system. In this paper, we describe the game and its theoretical underpinnings, and present preliminary results from a trial where players interacted with two systems that have different levels of accuracy.",

abstract="One of the most common tasks of a robot companion in the home is communication. In order to initiate an information exchange with its human partner, the robot needs to attract the attention of the human. This paper presents results of a user study (N=12) with elderly people (62 - 70 years) to evaluate different modalities for attracting attention. Results show that actions which involve sound generate the fastest reaction times and are better perceived by participants. Surprisingly attempting to attract attention by establishing eye-contact resulted in worse participants' perception. We interpret these results as that robot gazing behaviour is better suited for situations in which the user's focus of visual attention is already on the robot.",

abstract="The phenomenon of an aging society has derived problems such as shortage of medical resources, rising healthcare costs and reduction of quality in healthcare services. Pervasive healthcare aims to alleviate these problems, but many issues remain to be resolved. This paper presents a system called CARA (Context Aware Real-time Assistant) whose design goals are to address these issues in a pervasive long-term healthcare solution. CARA aims to provide efficient healthcare services by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. This system can continuously measure physiological signals, and either store the data on the server or stream the data to a remote location in real-time. A design goal of ubiquitous access has prompted the design of the system as a rich internet application. The only tool required is a web browser with the commonly-available Adobe Flash plug-in installed. Thus the system enables access and analysis on any internet-connected PC or appropriate smart device, independent of geographic location. The remote monitoring and data review applications of CARA are presented at as the main implementation examples. The results of experiments using the system are presented.",

abstract="Wi-Fi-based human behavior recognition technology is one of the research hotspots in the field of wireless sensing. However, the traditional Wi-Fi-based human behavior recognition algorithm does not consider the attenuation of Wi-Fi signals in the condition of wall barrier under complex indoor environments. As a result, the robustness of the Wi-Fi indoor human behavior recognition system is poor. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a Wi-Fi based behavior recognition algorithm through the wall. Firstly, the Wi-Fi signal distribution is analyzed according to the Wi-Fi signal model. Then, according to the distribution characteristics of different Wi-Fi signals, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is used to reconstruct the signal to complete the de-nosing processing of the Wi-Fi signal. Finally, feature extraction and feature classification in the time-frequency domain is performed to complete the human behavior recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher recognition accuracy in terms of walking and running than the traditional Wi-Fi based indoor recognition algorithms.",

The first step is the identification of appropriate technological trajectories, applying new production criteria, in consonance with the overall need of the society. This work takes into consideration several pathways in the most important sectors (energy sources, materials, chemical industry, manufacturing, agro-food and agro-industrial resources, recycling, desalination), which have to be considered as strategic and appropriate for sustainability. After having reported and discussed the main technical and economic features of these trajectories, especially their eco-compatibility --- two aspects, namely, the mutual interactions among all the the trajectories, and the difficulties that will be met to introduce and spread them at a large scale, in all countries and in all conditions, have been emphasized in order to evaluate their actual feasibility.",

abstract="Ambient systems may support the elderly in many aspects of their lives, bringing new level of comfort, higher safety, and better health. But, as we revealed in parallel research on deep design, there are dissonances in what do the elderly wish and what the intelligent technologies indeed offer. The dissonances may lead to reluctant acceptance or even to rejection of possibly beneficial products. In this paper we borrowed concepts from economics and transformed them into generic model which captures the mental process of evaluation of new aspects of life. Proposed model is specifically aimed on ambient intelligence products, viewed from the eyes of possible elderly users, though not necessarily limited to this particular focus. The process of evaluation, leading either to acceptance or to rejection, may be described as a sequence of rational selections from available options, based on perceived benefit (utility) and cost (in terms of time, effort, support from others). Simplifying preconditions introduced in the paper reduce the model to optimization problem of linear programming. In conclusions we discuss limitations of the model and suggest further possible refinements and evaluation.",

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) may help improve such process and be able to facilitate diverse clinical decision-making processes. In an attempt to achieve improved and evidence based care, we propose to make the connection between patients and clinicians using relevant standards. In the approach, patients collect relevant medical data periodically using personalized mobile healthcare system (PMHS) and share the data with clinical institutions to be compliant with the meaningful use of medical records. The collected medical data and measurement results are analyzed and the analysis result may be used to come up with personalized recommendations for preventing healthy people to become chronic disease patient. The ontology focuses on organizing measurement results semantically. For semantic use of the collected medical records, we have used Prot{\'e}g{\'e}-OWL for building ontology and used SPARQL query to retrieve meaningful information from the patient-provided medical data.",

Computing resources and computing services will be present everywhere and interconnected anytime. The focus of AmI is to bring to life the everyday objects and tools of our daily environment. The purposes of this technology are circumambient ways of monitoring the actions of humans and the changes in their environment. Sensors of many types and physical actors will be used to react and pre-act in a way that is articulated as desirable and pleasant. AmI as a `crossover approach' is strongly related to several other Computer Science topics (Punie 2003: 6; Schmidt 2004; Oulasvirta 2004). This technology is not new. A lot of ambient technology is already available, like monitoring analogue physical processes, describing them with digital data and analysing these data using knowledge-based interpretation models. New is that the public and the private environment of humans is permeated by an overwhelming number of autonomous active devices. This will cause the inevitability of the employment of artificial intelligent agents to automate routine decisions and to provide against stupefying read and write collisions15 of the artificial devices. There is no guarantee that these artificial agents can cooperate appropriately and safely.

abstract="Due to the demographic development towards an ageing society AAL technologies will play an important role in the future. There has been a lot of work done in the field of AAL, but most of the project outcomes are proprietary and thus impossible to be combined. Accordingly, there is a need for an universal and open platform, which can be used as a starting point for further developments or just as an integration and standardization tool. For future service platform related research projects reference use cases as well as a reference tool set and framework would help to ensure a reusable and expandable platform, which is wide spread and therefore ensures a quality of service. The aim of the universAAL project is to combine the advantages and strengths of still ongoing or already finished research projects to create an universally applicable platform. The focus thereby is on interoperability and standardization to ensure a broad range of applicability and to develop an open platform that will make it technically feasible and economically viable to develop AAL applications. There are two tools for spreading the outcomes and ideas of the project planned: On the one hand the establishment of a store providing plug-and-play AAL applications and services that support multiple execution platforms and can be deployed to various devices and users, and on the other hand the AAL Open Association (AALOA) with the mission to create a platform for identifying key research topics in AAL, and to reach agreement on prioritization of these and to design, develop, evaluate and standardize a common service platform for AAL.",

abstract="This paper introduces the Adopted-Pet (AP) protocol, an automatic (i.e. requiring no human interaction) secure pairing protocol, adequate for the pairing between a passive RFID tag and a reader. Most pairing protocols rely for their security on a certain advantage that the legitimate devices have over any malicious users. Such advantages include proximity (employing near-field communication) or secret keys that are either produced with the assistance of, or verified by, the legitimate user. The advantage exploited by our novel AP protocol is the amount of uninterrupted time spent by the two devices in the proximity (although not requiring near-field communication) of each-other. We discuss several implementation configurations, all based on pseudo-random bit generators, employing short-length LFSRs, and requiring no more than 2000 transistors. This makes the protocol ideally suited for low-cost passive RFID tags. For each configuration we show that the AP protocol is highly secure against occasional malicious entities.",

Context can be defined as ``the circumstances in which an event occurs'' and this concept has been successfully used in information processing for over 50 years, particularly for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The popularity of the context-aware architectures is due to the increasingly ubiquitous nature of the sensors, as well as the diversity of the environment under which the sensed signals are collected. To understand the intrinsic characteristics of the sensed signals and determine how BSNs should react to different events, the contextual information is essential to the adaptation of the monitoring device so as to provide more intelligent support to the users.",

abstract="The aim of the Human Behavior Monitoring and Support (HBMS) project is to learn about the individual skills and behavioral knowledge of a person in order to support that person when needed. It is intended as a contribution to enable elderly people to live autonomously in their domestic environment as long as possible. The basic idea is to build a cognitive model of the behavior of a person while she/he is of sound mind and memory. In case of mental incapacitation this model will be used as a knowledge base for generating support information. The paper outlines the first results of the HBMS project with a focus on the investigative survey and the overall architecture of the chosen approach.",

abstract="The motivation of this paper is to study the potential use of an attention-directed robot, embodied as a pan-tilt tablet display, for telepresence applications with the elderly. With an audio-visual attention control system, the robot automatically directs attention to a speaker by fusion of visual and auditory features. We conducted a user study involving experiential interaction with the robot, which oriented its display in the direction of the user's voice, and also tracked the user's face once it is in view of the robot's camera. A questionnaire was given to gather the opinions of the participants regarding the usability of the robot for the elderly, and their responses indicate a positive attitude, acceptance, and trust towards the attention-directed robot. By comparing the responses of subjects with different levels of video-conferencing experience, we found that subjects who video-conference more frequently tend to be more accepting of the robot. Furthermore, they indicated an acceptable price of the robot as less than the price of a tablet, and most of them expressed the desire to buy the robot in the near future.",

Growing range of mobile health care applications raises the question of their possible interference and cooperation. Particular benefit is expected from integration of personal and residential solutions, because of their complementary features. Consideration of various cooperation scenarios lead us to a specification of three cooperation levels depending on required integration of software. The paper presents details and experimental results of cooperation of two prototype surveillance systems lying in best result selection and conditional use of communication resources of the residential system as a carrier of messages from the personal system over the wired channel. This approach provides a cheap broadband data transfer minimizing the monitoring delays without limiting the subject mobility.",

IMS offers a group of common services which can be reused in different applications, and enable the running of the same application over any device, anywhere and anytime.

abstract="For Smart Environments used for elder care, learning the inhabitant's behavior patterns is fundamental to detect changes since these can signal health deterioration. A precise model needs to consider variations implied by the fact that human behavior has an stochastic nature and is affected by context conditions. In this paper, we model behavior patterns as usual activity start times. We introduce a Frequent Pattern Mining algorithm to estimate probable start times and their variations due to context conditions using only one single scan of the activity data stream. Experimentation using the Aruba CASAS and the ContextAct@A4H datasets and comparison with a Gaussian Mixture Model show our proposition provides adequate results for smart home environments domains with a lower computational time complexity. This allows the evaluation of behavior variations at different context dimensions and varied granularity levels for each of them.",

In a general way, I follow a `developmental life-cycle' approach, beginning with abuse of young children at day-care centres by violent (female) day-care workers, then move on to bullying, violent, abusive, and corrupt conduct by teachers and professors. Violence in the military is then analysed before turning attention to bullying in the workplace and certain bullying tactics employed by South Korea's most powerful companies. The chapter ends with cases of vulnerable and `weak' employees being exploited, which include the disabled and elderly security guards.",

abstract="Increasing availability of sensor-based location traces for individuals, combined with the goal of better understanding user context, has resulted in a recent emphasis on algorithms for automatically extracting users' significant places from location data. Place-finding can be characterized by two sub-problems, (1) finding significant locations, and (2) assigning semantic labels to those locations (the problem of ``moving from location to place'') [8]. Existing algorithms focus on the first sub-problem and on finding city-level locations. We use a principled approach in adapting Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to provide a first solution for finding significant places within the home, based on the first set of long-term, precise location data collected from several homes. We also present a novel metric for quantifying the similarity between places, which has the potential to assign semantic labels to places by comparing them to a library of known places. We discuss several implications of these new techniques for the design of Ubicomp systems.",

It profoundly influences how we look, feel, think, and act. If we want a computer to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have primitive instincts. In this paper, we will review the recent work in this area, the building blocks for the instinctive operating system, and potential applications. The paper proposes a 'bottom-up' approach that is focused on human basic instincts: forage, vigilance, reproduction, intuition and learning. They are the machine codes in human operating systems, where high-level programs, such as social functions can override the low-level instinct. However, instinctive computing has been always a default operation. Instinctive computing is the foundation of Ambient Intelligence as well as Empathic Computing. It is an essential part of Human Computing.",

abstract="The number of elderly people, who are unable to live independently and need assistance due to cognitive impairment, will rise rapidly in the aging society. To assist the independent living of these individuals and decrease the caregiver burden have become an important public health concern in the future. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive function and dementia. The symptoms of MCI include difficulty remembering recent events or recently acquired information, depression and anxiety. MCI also increases the fall risk and affects patients' social function and behavior. Sufficient physical activities can improve health of brain and reduce the risk of MCI. Since the context-aware computing technologies for assisting living have gained great popularity. We proposed a context-based activity prompting system to improve quality of life for MCI patients. The proposed system utilizes a smart phone as a sensor device to transmit sensing data to cloud server for activity recognition and activity level estimation, and uses context-based technique to provide activity prompting message to MCI patients. The activity prompting service supplies the activities self-management for MCI patients and helps them living independently. The system also provides real time fall detection mechanism to shorten the rescue time when accident happened. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed system achieves high accuracy on activity recognition and activity level estimation.",

We present the state-of-the-art in indoor positioning and the current research trend towards including additional sensor information to achieve positioning enhancements and gather more context information. After introducing a few interesting scenarios, we present a guideline on how indoor positioning can be classified in technical ways and also in more abstract ways. We also define metrics (accuracy, costs, privacy, context information) which we then use to evaluate the current state-of-the-art research.

It is important to state here that this chapter is not about ``what works,'' nor is it about ``promising directions.'' I argue instead for working towards an adequate recognition of the actual material conditions of leadership in urban settings, better theorizations, more reasonable demands and judgments made about head-teacher practice, and an expanded policy agenda for urban school reform.

However, a commercial adoption is still pending, due to scalability and acceptability constraints. Most research in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) appears to have a heavy design, where precise features are first selected, and hardware architecture is designed accordingly. Although it may provide interesting results, such approach leads to a lack of scalability. This is why we experimented a lighter approach for a real deployment. The complexity is shifted from hardware to software, and we aim to make meaningful information emerge from simple and generic sensor data, in order to recognize abnormal and dangerous situations. In this paper, we will describe how to retrieve consistent information, so that residents' behaviors may be observed. This work might serve as a proof of concept that a light and generic approach fits in large scale deployments, with acceptable cost and scalability.",

abstract="The Healthcare Delivery System is defined as the comprehensive collection of actors, stakeholders, and the relationships amongst them, which when in action deliver care to the patients, create economic value for the participants, serve government interests and service societal needs. When thinking about the healthcare delivery system it's beneficial to think in terms of a value chain. Lacking this integrated view in research leads to a one dimensional assessment or fails to consider views of all the stakeholders in illustrating the problem space (Chaudhry et al., 2006). Figure 2.1 is an illustration of the Healthcare Delivery System in context of usage, adoption, and diffusion of HIT centered on the patient, provider, and payer. The following sections will describe in detail the significance, impact, and influence of each of the components as it partitions to delivery of healthcare and diffusion of Health Information Technology.",

abstract="Within today's environment of relentless urban growth, socio-technical approaches towards enhancing wellbeing within the urban have started gathering momentum. Situated in this context, the research paper presents an approach to actively instigate physiological and psychological behavioral change within people for promoting wellbeing via context aware augmentation of physical environments. This involves harnessing a trans-disciplinary approach wherein, the domains of data sciences, HCI, embedded robotics, computational simulation and user-centric interaction design merge in order to promote real-time responsive augmentation (physical, ambient, social and structural) of the built environment. The paper elaborates upon two projects: RoboZoo and FLUID, both built and tested in The Netherlands, representing two different scales; Small scale: object/product scale, which operate within urban open public space and Large scale: indoor public installation.",

abstract="Technology designed to sense behavior, often neglects to directly incorporate subjective input from (elderly) users. This paper presents experiences in deploying technology that considers the elderly user and their subjective input as a way to enrich sensor data systems and empower the user. For this purpose, the paper draws on: (1) Observations of shortcomings in terms of capturing objective data from sensors as experienced in long-term deployments in the homes of older adults; (2) The design and evaluation of a wide range of applications especially designed to enable older adults to give subjective input on how they are doing, including an interactive television quiz, a talking picture frame and a tangible mood board, and (3) The development and field study of one application, the `Mood button' in particular, that was tested in real-world sensing settings to work with a commercial sensing system. In doing this, this work aims to contribute towards successful sensing deployments and tools that give more control to the (elderly) end-user.",

Assistive technologies, adaptive systems and context-aware applications are three well-established research areas whose findings can be interestingly merged. In particular, adaptation methods and techniques support the adaptation of existing software to better suit each user's need. In the last years, the need of building applications that allow the inclusion of people with special needs in different fields has been emphasized. Along this chapter, we present different research works that contribute to the integration of this collective, by providing means to support either their personal development or the accomplishment of their daily tasks. The technological solutions chosen for this chapter are mainly related to three areas of application: activities of daily living, health and education. This chapter also summarizes the most widely used adaptation features and processes in this context.",

Also, there are not so many e-health user-centered systems that provide assistance and good recommendations to users at any time in the location they are situated. The aim of this paper is to propose a model based on the integration of several approaches such as: ubiquitous computing, adaptive and recommender systems, web-based and user-centered multi-agent systems, and ontologies. In addition, an e-health web-based system prototype was built based on this model adopting mechanisms to search for information from anywhere and anytime, thus providing ubiquity characteristics.

It provides context-aware data fusion and representation as well as inference mechanisms that support remote patient monitoring and caregiver notification. Noteworthy about the work is the use of fuzzy-logic to deal with the imperfections of the data, and the use of both structure and hierarchy to control the application of rules in the context reasoning system.",

Giving up is not an option, and the only way out is the way forward. Therefore it can be boldly concluded that Panasonic as a corporation will still exist 50 years from now, and maybe even a 100 years from now.

Elinor, recounting his confession to her sister, miniaturizes his disclosure: she offers ``the chief points [of] his apology {\ldots} and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged'' (347--348). In a hyper-vaulted juncture of the symbolic and the literal, Marianne, seizing each microbic sign of Willoughby that Elinor offers, ``caught every syllable with panting eagerness'' (348). Such a moment typifies this novel's attention to the minute---that is, both the detailed and the small. Austen's incorporation of the miniature occurs in a particular context: eighteenth-century Britain had seen the revival of art forms such as painting in miniature (figure 1.1), the exchange of hair as gifts, the preservation of hair in jewelry (figure 1.2), and the craft of filigree, also known as ``quilling'' (figure 1.3). Women, both amateurs and paid professionals, often worked these arts and materials, and such items were linked to ideologically coded feminine sensibilities because of their small size, intimacy, and intricacy.2",

Strong earthquake striking Nepalon April 25, 2015 gave rise to such a strong demand. Although the three countries have not yet seriously negotiated the matter concerning the joint establishment of the corridor, the academic community has discussed about it for long. This article emphasizes the importance of the construction of the China--Nepal--India Economic Corridor in meeting six major demands, namely, the demand of filling up the depression development across the trans-Himalayan region, the demand of promoting the interconnectivity between China and South Asia in parallel, the demand of transferring the surplus production capacity in China, the demand of steadily propelling the establishment of a ``closer development partnership'' between China and India, the demand of connecting the construction of China's One Belt and One Road initiative by land and by sea, and the demand of trying to break through the geopolitical predicament in South Asia. For China, Nepal and India, the time is ripe for promoting the corridor construction. On the one hand, the political transformation of Nepal is almost complete, providing the political security for the corridor construction. On the other hand, China and India have laid a good foundation for the corridor construction. The corridor construction will vigorously activate the geographical location advantages and cultural resources between two major markets neighboring Nepal, the world's second most abundant water resources and the unique humanistic tourism resources brought by the Qinghai--Tibet Plateau, etc. Nevertheless, the corridor construction will not be built in one step. Instead, many challenges need to be overcome first, such as the interference from the traditional Indian geopolitical thinking, the interference of the Indian market protectionism, and the interference of various non-traditional security threats. In this regard, in the process of promoting the corridor construction, the above three countries, China in particular, shall be patient and composed enough and take into full account all the conditions such as Nepal's tolerance and acceptance as well as India's sensitivity and tolerance. In short, the author believes that against the backdrop that the phenomenon of anti-globalization is increasingly obvious, the free trade is stuck in a downturn, and the protectionism and populism is well popular today, China and India, two major Eastern countries, shall have the reason and the obligation to take the initiative to fill in the regional cooperation vacancy formed due to the shrinkage or even exit of the United States, the Europe and other Western countries, thus providing more public goods and resources for the regional development.

abstract="Pervasive computing is allowing healthcare to move from care by professionals in hospital to self-care, mobile care, and at-home care. The pervasive healthcare system, CARA(Context Aware Real-time Assistant), is designed to provide personalized healthcare services for chronic patients in a timely and appropriate manner by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. This paper presents a fuzzy-logic based context model and a related context-aware reasoning middleware that provides a personalized, flexible and extensible reasoning framework for CARA. It provides context-aware data fusion and representation as well as inference mechanisms that support remote patient monitoring and caregiver notification. Noteworthy about the work is the use of fuzzy-logic to deal with the imperfections of the data, and the use of both structure and hierarchy to control the application of rules in the context reasoning system.",

abstract="By their very nature, Intelligent Environments (IE's) are infused with complexity, unreliability and uncertainty due to a combination of sensor noise and the human element. The quantity, type and availability of data to model these applications can be a major issue. Each situation is contextually different and constantly changing. The dynamic nature of the implementations present a challenging problem when attempting to model or learn a model of the environment. Training data to construct the model must be within the same feature space and have the same distribution as the target task data, however this is often highly costly and time consuming. There can even be occurrences were a complete lack of labelled target data occurs. It is within these situations that our study is focussed. In this paper we propose a framework to dynamically model IE's through the use of data sets from differing feature spaces and domains. The framework is constructed using a novel Fuzzy Transfer Learning (FuzzyTL) process.",

BCC is an area of much interest globally, with applications in military, security, space, health care, sports and entertainment already identified. From a technical perspective, many of the problems encountered in BCC systems are relatively independent of the specific application, with some minor distinctions. In particular, space and military applications have particular requirements on robustness and extreme operating conditions that are somewhat more relaxed in other areas. The fundamental design issues are examined in this chapter from the perspective of three main areas: antennas, wireless communication protocols and sensing technologies. Examples from health care and sports applications are used to demonstrate key concepts and challenges. Current and future trends are discussed, with an emphasis on the recently released IEEE 802.15.6 wireless communications standard.",

abstract="Context-aware applications rely on implicit forms of input, such as sensor-derived data, in order to reduce the need for explicit input from users. They are especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing environments, in which user attention is at a premium. To support the development of context-aware applications, techniques for modelling context information are required. These must address a unique combination of requirements, including the ability to model information supplied by both sensors and people, to represent imperfect information, and to capture context histories. As the field of context-aware computing is relatively new, mature solutions for context modelling do not exist, and researchers rely on information modelling solutions developed for other purposes. In our research, we have been using a variant of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to model context. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences and outline some research challenges in this area.",

The important issue in deployment is the noninvasiveness. That is, the user should not feel inconvenience. Therefore, our system has been developed by making use of FSR sensors and an optional small body-activity sensor. In particular, FSR sensor is a typical noninvasive sensor since it has a shape of film. In order to make a light-weight monitoring system, we use as small number of sensors as possible. And we adopt rule-based ADL inferring algorithms to avoid inconvenience in collecting training data for supervised learning. For the purpose of improving the accuracy of occupation/usage detection, we make FSR sensors into FSR array sensors. We evaluate the proposed system in laboratory and real home environment.",

Especially, for the at-home monitoring, the demand of which is increasing, not only close observation, but also accurate behavior recognition of daily living activity, as well as motor function evaluation, are necessary. In this study, such a system was established by developing a cost-effective, safe and easy to use mobile robot. With such a robotic monitoring system, the in-hospital time for most MIPs and the burden to therapists can be significantly decreased. In order to realize the robotic monitoring system, we proposed several algorithms to solve the difficulties arising from the mobile sensing for moving MIPs, and recognize several frequent daily living activities, including impaired walking. Concretely, algorithms to use both color images and depth images was proposed to improve the accuracy of MIPs measurement, and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was implemented to deal with the uncertainty on time sequence data and relate the state transitions over time for daily living activity recognition. Experiments have demonstrated promising results on joint trajectory measurement, and recognition of daily living activities.",

The implications of the varying interaction of exclusion and inclusion in economic policies and of public service delivery in India create some peculiar, unique and yet fundamental features of the Indian modernization. `Modern' ideas like the Universal Basic Income are also distorted by their situation in the unequal Indian context. Finally, `modern' technology and its uses in India, assume particular significance because of the recent obsession with digitization that has come to symbolize the goal of modernization among the ruling groups and the aspirational middle classes, yet its impact may once again be unequal and even divisive.",

abstract="Using service robots at home is becoming more and more popular in order to help people in their life routine. Such robots are required to do various tasks, from user notification to devices manipulation. However, in such complex environments, robots sometimes fail to achieve one task. Failing is problematic as it is unpleasant for the user and may cause critical situations. Therefore, understanding and preventing failures is a challenging need. In this paper, we propose LEAF, an experience based approach to prevent task failure.

It then uses this new knowledge to adapt a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) in order to prevent selecting tasks that have a high risk of failure in the plan.

abstract="Given the continuous rise of energy consumption, the limited availability of fossil fuel and the uncontrollable risks inherent to nuclear power, a transition of the energy system is necessary and inevitable. Thus, governments around the world are promoting renewable energy sources to achieve a cleaner and sustainable energy production. Being able to integrate massive flows of renewable and therefore fluctuating energies needs a new way to run the electricity grids. SMT is one part of these new smart grids, and one of the first steps in the transformation progress from today's grids to the smart grids of the future. In this chapter, the results of the study are discussed and interpreted against this background. In the Sects. 7.1 and 7.2 the theoretical and practical contributions of the study are outlined separately. In Sect. 7.3 limitations and further research are briefly outlined.",

abstract="In this research we examine the influence of technical expertise on future medical technology. Technical expertise is assumed to positively influence the acceptance of modern technologies, and there is evidence within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector for this. While no one would seriously dispute this basic impact of technical expertise on technology acceptance, it is far from clear what the main drivers of technical expertise are. In order to understand the complex nature of expertise on the one hand and its impact on the acceptance of other technology domains on the other, an empirical approach was undertaken. 100 participants (19-75 years) participated in a survey, in which the acceptance of a medical mobile device was explored. Outcomes show (1) that technical expertise is a highly complex construct entailing different facets (knowledge, motivational, emotional and pragmatic components), which are influenced by age and gender of respondents (2) technical expertise in the ICT domain decisively modulates acceptance of medical technology. Interestingly, a low technical expertise does not only reduce the acceptance of the pro-using arguments, but is specifically related to a high confirmation of contrausing arguments.",

abstract="We have developed an approach for whole-house gross movement and room transition detection through sensing at only one point in the home. We consider this system to be one member of an important new class of human activity monitoring approaches based on what we call infrastructure mediated sensing, or ``home bus snooping.'' Our solution leverages the existing ductwork infrastructure of central heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems found in many homes. Disruptions in airflow, caused by human inter-room movement, result in static pressure changes in the HVAC air handler unit. This is particularly apparent for room-to-room transitions and door open/close events involving full or partial blockage of doorways and thresholds. We detect and record this pressure variation from sensors mounted on the air filter and classify where certain movement events are occurring in the house, such as an adult walking through a particular doorway or the opening and closing of a particular door. In contrast to more complex distributed sensing approaches for motion detection in the home, our method requires the installation of only a single sensing unit (i.e., an instrumented air filter) connected to an embedded or personal computer that performs the classification function. Preliminary results show we can classify unique transition events with up to 75-80{\%} accuracy.",

abstract="Human activity recognition (HAR) has become an active research topic in the various fields. Depth sensor-based HAR recognizes human activities using features from depth human silhouettes via classifiers such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Conditional Random Fields Model etc. In this paper, we propose a new HAR system via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of deep learning algorithms. We extract joint angles from multiple body joints changing in time and create a spatiotemporal feature matrix (i.e., multiple body joint angles in time). With these derived features, we train and test our CNN for HAR. In order to evaluate our system, we have compared the performance of our CNN-based HAR against the HMM- and Deep Belief Network (DBN)-based HAR using a database of Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Our test results show that the proposed CNN-based HAR is able to recognize twelve human activities reliably and it outperforms the HMM- and DBN-based systems. We have achieved the average recognition accuracy of 98.59{\%} for the activities. The results are 6.1{\%} more accurate than that of the HMM-based HAR and 1.05{\%} more accurate than that of the DBN-based HAR.",

abstract="This chapter examines the newest types of social simulations, which are object-based to represent social entities in ways that are more explicit than through variable-oriented models. The social simulations examined in this chapter constitute a rich and growing family of generative models consisting of two main classes: cellular automata and agent-based or multi-agent models. Both are generally seen as spatial models, but they can as easily capture network aspects of social complexity. Processes of urbanization and opinion dynamics are often simulated through the use of cellular automata. Spatial or organizational agent-based models are used to simulate social complexity in an increasing variety of domains, ranging from cultural dynamics to financial crises; from regional transportation systems to public health management; from humanitarian crises to global processes, such as climate change and the rise and fall of polities and civilizations. Agent-based simulations do this by using the versatility of multi-agent systems as computational frameworks within which modelers and programmers integrate social, natural, and artificial entities and dynamics. These social simulations often make use of other methodologies, such as network analysis or geographic information systems and remote sensing data.",

Such national digital strategy is the result of negotiations among a multitude of actors within and outside the government and involves managing challenges resulting from power imbalances among key stakeholders and the creation of appropriate institutions to ensure a long-term vision. The second level, which we call enterprise strategy, focuses on developing plans and implementing programs to facilitate the creation of technology infrastructure and systems that support the substantive work of government. Digital government enterprise strategy encompasses those who are responsible for managing information technology and systems in different government agencies and working closely with the programmatic areas to plan and implement technology initiatives that deliver public value.",

abstract="This chapter considers the politics of Big DataBig Data, as politics is the process of action and ideas to shape, gain, and contend power, and the politics of Big Data is concerned with the power relations over dataData, its collection, analysis, and use. Hence, the state, citizens, civil society, and businesses all have interests and incentives to control or influence Big Data, as dataData that can form the basis for framing problems and suggesting solutions is potentially political, for good or ill; since changing the information on which policy choices are framed and resolved, it will affect, and be affected by, politics. Furthermore, by offering unprecedented opportunities and challenges to the ways citizens and governments interact, it will alter the nature of the state and the nature of government. Big Data politics will, therefore, have the potential to reconfigure the power dynamics of elites and shift the social contractSocial contract between the citizen and the state. In other words, Big Data, in the public sector, will dramatically transform public services into better targeted, needs-based delivery, a process which will increase the accessibility, reach, and effectiveness of public services. Furthermore, by delivering to citizens the precise services that they need, Big Data can significantly improve public trustPublic trust in political leadershipLeadership and as a result boost the legitimacy of the state. However, another issue of political contestation will be the extent to which the past (dataData) can condemn the present and the future. The balance between privacy and the common interest will become more complex. The rights and liberties of the individual will be more constrained, while the limitations, errors, and biases in dataData gathering and its interpretation will pose new problems. Moreover, Big Data, along with rapid and pervasive technological progress, will have many disruptive effects, on labour markets, the economy, and society, as well as in government. Managing these ``disruptions'' will require political skill. Conversely, in the private sector, big business ownership of Big Data will strengthen the capacity of major international corporations to view, understand, and potentially manipulate society for private gain. Public concerns in this area will create the biggest fault line in the politics around Big Data. In this regard, the extent to which the state should regulate in the interests of the subjects of the dataData, the dataData generators, or the dataData owners will become a further topic of political contention. In sum, the long view of history suggests that the biggest political challenge will be to ensure Big Data works for all and is perceived as doing so. Overt political oversight will be needed if governments are to demonstrate ethical collection, analysis, and use of Big Data to maintain citizens' trust and bolster the legitimacy of the state. Political unrest will result, if Big Data appears to be exacerbating discrimination, exclusion, or extreme inequalities. Understanding and engaging with the politics of Big Data will prove to be an essential skill for public officials everywhere, including in seeking to deliver on the Sustainable Development GoalsSustainable Development Goals agreed by the United NationsUnited Nations Member States.",

abstract="The current work presents the SPEAKYACUTATTILE system, a computer based platform designed to enable its users to access a number of ICT services such as house management, health status monitoring or recreational services. It is deeply grounded on voice interaction and represents a Spoken Language System (SLS) meant to be a sort of intelligent assistant with which the users can vocally interact. The paper dwells on an experimental assessment of the system. Linear regression analysis have been carried out in order to assess the influence of system performance---in terms of dialogue efficiency metrics and dialogue quality metrics---on the perceived satisfaction of users. Results show that longer dialogues are preferred in order to positively influence the users satisfaction, suggesting the importance for people to have time for getting confident with new ICT solutions. Moreover, from the experimental analysis, it clearly emerges how system intervention should be reduced, suggesting how a good balance between user and system turns represents an important aspect for a fluid interaction. The same can be speculated for dialogues with no met requests that also tended to be associated with lower satisfaction scores. These last results support the importance for a vocal assistant to be effective in its purpose in order to be perceived as useful and satisfying.",

abstract="Those suffering from mild dementia exhibit impairments of memory, thought and reasoning. It has been recognised that deployment of technological solutions to address such impairments may have a major positive impact on the quality of life and can be used to help perform daily life activities hence maintaining a level of independence. In this paper we present an overview of our current investigations into how technology can be used to improve the quality of life of the ageing person with mild dementia. Specifically, we detail the methodology adopted for our work, outline results attained from a series of workshops to identify user needs and finally present how these user needs have been mapped onto the design of home based assistive technologies.",

abstract="In recent years, activity recognition has attracted extensive attention and been applied in many areas including smart home, healthcare, energy saving, etc. A number of approaches for activity recognition have been proposed. However, the dispersion of values of run sensors imposes negative effect on activity recognition. In this paper, an approach based on value revision is proposed to recognize the activities of a resident. First, the time and the total duration that each sensor is run are calculated as sensor attributes in an activity record. Second, the start time, end time and duration of an activity record are extracted from a set of activity records as activity attributes. Third, the information gains of attributes are calculated to filter attributes which have low the information gains. Fourth, values of attributes of tested activity records are replaced with the most similar values of attributes of activity records of training dataset. Finally, classifiers are exploited to recognize daily activities. This paper validates the recognition of daily activities in two datasets by comparing the proposed approach and a previous approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach favourably outperforms previous approach.",

To this end, we use the Situation concept of the DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL) ontology to formally capture the context of high-level activities. Moreover, we use context similarity measures to handle the intrinsic characteristics of pervasive environments in real-world conditions, such as missing information, temporal inaccuracies or activities that can be performed in several ways. We illustrate the performance of the proposed framework through its deployment in a hospital for monitoring activities of Alzheimer's disease patients.",

abstract="Aging is associated with an increased risk of isolation. Interpersonal communication with family members, friends, and caregivers is crucial to healthy aging. This paper presents a telepresence robot ``TRiCmini+'' which can be used as an agent of the children or caregivers in an older adult's home environment, to duplicate three dimensional face-to-face interpersonal communications. TRiCmini+ can be separated into the ``brain (a tablet)'' and the ``body (the robotic vehicle)''. With this structure, the robot control software is an App which can be downloaded, maintained and updated easily through the Internet. TRiCmini+ is integrated with social network services such as Google Talk and Facebook, to provide a wide range of communication and information sharing easily and conveniently. The effectiveness of using TRiCmini+ in communication is evaluated. The results showed that the telepresence performance in both verbal and nonverbal ways is better than the traditional telepresence robot without nonverbal way of interpersonal communication.",

abstract="We propose a multi-view onboard clustering of skeleton data for fall risk discovery. Clustering by an autonomous mobile robot opens the possibility for monitoring older adults from the most appropriate positions, respecting their privacies, and adapting to various changes. Since the data that the robot observes is a data stream and communication network can be unreliable, the clustering method in this case should be onboard. Motivated by the rapid increase of older adults in number and the severe outcomes of their falls, we adopt Kinect equipped robots and focus on gait skeleton analysis for fall risk discovery. Our key contributions are new between-skeleton distance measures for risk discovery and two series of experiments with our onboard clustering. The experiments revealed several key findings for the method and the application as well as interesting outcomes such as clusters which consist of unexpected risky postures.",

The European Commission suggest a `science of global systems' to improve the way that science can help inform policy and societal responses to global challenges such as climate change, global financial crises, global pandemics, city growth and migration patterns. The new science requires radically novel ideas and thinking to embed scientific evidence into the policy and societal processes.

abstract="A study was conducted to examine the expectations that younger and older individuals have about domestic robots and how these expectations relate to robot acceptance. In a questionnaire participants were asked to imagine a robot in their home and to indicate how much items representing technology, social partner, and teammate acceptance matched their robot. There were additional questions about how useful and easy to use they thought their robot would be. The dependent variables were attitudinal and intentional acceptance. The analysis of the responses of 117 older adults (aged 65-86) and 60 younger adults (aged 18-25) indicated that individuals thought of robots foremost as performance-directed machines, less so as social devices, and least as unproductive entities. The robustness of the Technology Acceptance Model to robot acceptance was supported. Technology experience accounted for the variance in robot acceptance due to age.",

The project seeks to create a new assistance system for mentally disabled people or people with reduced mobility (Stikic et al., PervasiveHealth 2008, Second International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare, 2008) [1] using S.H.E.L.L. Personal Kit: a Secure Habitat for an Enhanced Long Living Personal Kit, a series of environmental devices that should be stationary and easy to use and implement and a modular system. The aim is to turn them into mass products. The S.H.E.L.L. Personal Kit is made up of an smart wearable device, a tablet docking station and a series of environmental elements for localization and to receive/transmit data. The principal goal of the project is enhancing safety and autonomy for its users through automatic alarms, integrated in a wireless sensor net. The system can detect specific habits of the people that are being monitored, thus allowing them to move freely in their surroundings. It guarantees constant assistance by interacting in the case of an emergency and alerting family members or caretakers of any anomaly in the observed data.",

Doing this for two very different countries, different in size, population, and urbanization level (Sect. 2.3), is a challenge of its own. The need to come to positive results may be much more challenging in China than in Germany. But the strategies can be readily compared, and the two sides can learn from each other about the efficiency of strategies and concepts.",

abstract="Two distinct phenomena shape our planet: more than half of the world's human population is urbanised (World Watch Institute 2007); and global warming induced climate change is a grave threat. Modern cities, in ecological terms, have become parasitic energy and resource `sinks,' consuming 75{\%} of the world's resources on only 2{\%} of the global land area (TFPC 1999). In this way cities `short-circuit' the natural ecological cycle, harming both the nutrient source and sink. As the rate of urbanisation increases over time, food production sites should be increasingly located near main consumption centres. Roof top farming is one such solution to meet growing demand of safe and healthy food, improving air quality, heat influx, reduced corridors for local flora and fauna. Urban agriculture is gaining relevance all over the world due to its ability to provide direct benefits (food) but also some indirect ecosystem services at a macro level (conservation of biodiversity). This paper presents a survey of roof top farming in South Delhi, India and their importance from ecosystem services, food security and climate change perspective. The paper shows the way forward to popularise roof top farming in cities through outreach programmes, capacity development and policy interventions.",

abstract="The residential sector accounts for approximately 27 and 17{\%} of the world energy consumption and its CO2 emission, respectively. Thus, developing measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in this sector, which is highly associated with the rapidly increasing proportion of world's urban population, is crucial to ensuring the sustainable development of the urban environment. However, the majority of the existing expertise on energy sustainability revolves around improving the thermal quality of the building envelop with lesser focus on the social and behavioural aspects of energy consumption. Given the importance of factors pertaining to the latter aspects, which are found to be responsible for 4--30{\%} of the variation in residential energy consumption, this paper aims to address and explore for the first time the impact of the UK residents' life-cycle evolution on their energy usage. To attain this, an official database encompassing around 5000 households observed over the course of 10 years was analysed with the help of specific statistical tests and procedures (e.g. logistic regression). First, logistic regression was employed to determine the socio-economic factors influencing households' evolution from one state to another; consequently, future evolutionary models covering a 10-year window, were predicted. This was followed by analysing the effect of the predicted evolutionary models on the households' gas and electricity usage patterns using point-biserial correlation. Finally, the findings suggest that households' evolution have a significant effect on their energy consumption patterns. However, the magnitude and the direction of this effect is weak and mostly positive, respectively.",

The main focus in this paper is on the use of an ontology to facilitate the generation of user-based queries to the CR system. By leveraging from the ontology, users need not know about sensor details and the structure of the ontology in expressing queries related to events of interest. To validate the approach and demonstrate the flexibility of the ontology for query generation, the ontology has been integrated in two separate application domains. The first domain considers a health care system implemented for the GiraffPlus project where the query generation process is automated to request information about activities of daily living. The second application uses the same ontology for an air quality monitoring application in the home. Since these two systems are independently developed for different purposes, the ease of applying the ontology upon them can be considered as a credit for its generality.",

This project aims to provide users and their families with a sense of mental and physical security in their houses. It will also help them pass through the abstraction of money, since they will not need costly home care nursing services, and they will enjoy relief without having an observer, hence providing a significant socioeconomic impact. The system has three main features: (1) Sensing data gathered from the accelerometer and Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes embedded in the Shimmer sensing device; (2) Real time monitoring and alerting system; and (3) Medical logging consists of time, position, strength, and location of the fall. The real-time classification of the fall detection has been achieved with an accuracy of 90{\%} using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Moreover, the KNN hardware implementation requires 48{\%} of Look-Up Tables (LUTs) and 22{\%} of Flip-Flops (FFs) available on the Zedboard while consuming 582 Mw.",

abstract="The presented approach solves the problem of organizing a well-structured dialogue between a smartwatch wearer and a health assistance app running on the smartwatch. Especially for emergency situations, when the app has concluded the presence of several threatening health or security hazards. Such situations require an effective, joint handling of all acute health and security hazards in one combined dialogue. Otherwise, the domain specific knowledge for concluding present hazards has been isolated deliberately into separate units for efficient maintenance and comprehensibility. It is represented in a declarative way by finite state machines. A multitude of such finite state machines will be executed simultaneously in the app for monitoring all relevant potential health and/or security hazards. Furthermore, the tactical knowledge for dialogue handling of concluded hazards is represented independently from the domain specific knowledge by ``critical dialogue sections'', CDSs. A CDS has an internal activity structure for controlling the dialogue with the smartwatch wearer in order the handle the concluded hazard. During the execution of a CDS, the smartwatch I/O and communication devices are exclusively attached to the CDS. Effective handling of such concluded hazards does typically include to establish a speech connection with distant family members or a home emergency call center. This can be achieved via the integrated cellular phone of the smartwatch. The selection of the situationally most appropriate hazard for handling is done via a central scheduler utilizing a blackboard. Our application framework relieves the software developer from dealing with the details and obstacles of effective dialogue implementation and allows to focus on the domain specific knowledge and handling logic of the assistance app.",

abstract="Examining Glasgow's older, pre-industrial amusement culture centred on the Saltmarket taverns and Glasgow Fair, this chapter explores how in its first phase from the 1860s to the 1890s the Britannia's managers adopted temperance policies, and the language and rhetoric of improvement, the dominant ideology of Glasgow's municipal politics, to cultivate progressive opinion and the acceptance of the police and licensing authorities. Examining music hall's rise in the wider context of the urban development of the city centre, it explores how the Britannia's refurbishment and introduction of new codes of dress and behaviour were used as strategies to demonstrate music hall's claims to be considered a responsibly administered commercial entertainment.",

abstract="People suffering from cognitive deficits -- Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, brain injuries -- are often obliged to live in medical institutions. Pervasive computing and mobile applications are key technology that may help them to stay at home. They can be at the root of information systems as cognitive assistance and telemonitoring. Inside a smart house, cognitive assistance could alleviate cognitive impairments by giving personalized environmental cues. Besides telemonitoring could inform relatives and medical staff of the disease evolution and could alert them in case of emergency. But cognitively impaired people must not be confined in their home. Cognitive assistance and telemonitoring must be available outdoors too. This paper sketches an infrastructure and prototypes making the most of indoor pervasive computing and outdoor mobile computing to achieve cognitive assistance and telemonitoring.",

This is because of their populous nature, vast economies, expansive geographical dimensions and the complexity of their political and administrative systems. While a recent UN report based on a global survey singled out SA as an e-gov exemplar in SSA, Nigeria only managed a second-best place in the worst ranked West Africa region. Hinged on the notion that the provision of government services and information through electronic or online means is a crucial way of popularizing information and communication technologies (ICTs) among populations, this chapter examines not only the challenges of e-governance initiatives but also probes the extent to which they could aid or hinder efficacious democracy.",

A coordinator agent proposes a new planning model, where the complex processes are modeled as external services. The agent acts as coordinators of Web services that implement the four stages of the case-based planning cycle. One of the main aims of the pervasive systems is to be able to adapt themselves in execution time to the changes in the number of resources available, the mobility of the users, variability in the needs of the users and failures of the system. Multiagent systems are suitable to resolve these issues due to their capabilities such as autonomy, reactivity, pro-activity, mobility, etc.",

abstract="The increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters in Asia are highly correlated with the rapid urban transition now taking place in this world region. Five types of urban transition effects are identified to explain how the urbanization of disasters calls for fundamental changes in approaches to disaster prevention, response, adaptation and resilience. The effects include agglomeration and the formation of mega-urban regions, spatial polarization in high-risk zones, new forms and magnitudes of vulnerability, compound disasters and the expanding ecological reach of cities. Taken together, they call for a shift from expert-centred disaster management to participatory disaster governance as the framework for society-wide engagement in all phases of disaster experiences and responses. Three spatial scales of governance -- neighbourhood, city region and transborder riparian region -- are among the most critical to be included in the search for innovations in disaster governance.",

abstract="We describe stroke patients' activity patterns and trends based on motion data acquired during their stay in an ambulatory day-care centre. Our aim was to explore and quantify intensity and development in the patients' activity patterns as these may change during the rehabilitation process. We analyse motion data recordings from wearable inertial measurement units of eleven patients up to eleven days, totally 102 recording days. Using logic rules, we extract activity primitives, including affected arm move, sit, stand, walking, etc. from selected channels of the continuous median-filtered sensor data. Using relative duration of the activity primitives, we examine patient activity patterns regarding independence in mobility, distribution of walking over the days and trends in using the affected body side. Due to the heterogeneity of patients' behaviour, we focused on analysing patient-specific activity patterns. Our exploration showed that the rule-based activity primitive analysis is beneficial to understand individual patient activity.",

In order to enable the elderly and disabled to be fully integrated into the society, it's of paramount importance to build a pervasive assistive environment where assistive services can be automatically discovered and easily accessed with the device-to-hand across the physical spaces. In this paper, we propose a framework that can support impromptu service discovery and context-aware service access with mobile devices in heterogeneous assistive environments. Different from the existing approaches, the framework requires no specialized hardware or software installation in mobile client devices, it can automatically generate personalized user interfaces based on context such as user preference and device capability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we prototyped a set of assistive services in public spaces like shopping malls, leveraging the OSGi-based platform accessible from any WLAN enabled mobile devices.",

We have developed a system to support a generic platform for rapid prototyping of sensing and control applications in which different sensors and actuators are brought together to perform specific functions. At the heart of the system-of-systems is the Control INterface to Devices and Instruments (CINDI), a small Linux-based box with a number of standard interfaces.

She had come a long way to get there. She had left behind her ``first'' life in San Francisco, where she had been a successful writer and teacher, happy---until her husband had left her, also taking the house, and forcing her to live in a small, depressing furnished flat. Then the unexpected present from her women friends had arrived: a ten-day holiday in Tuscany, to relax and forget everything. She had thought about it for a while, but in the end she had accepted. After a few days in Italy--- it still seemed incredible---that impulsive decision to buy an old villa to be renovated right there, in the heart of Tuscany, near Cortona. What madness! But it had been wonderful, everything, renovating the house, working with the Polish laborers, following the love of the youngest of these workmen, Pawel, for Chiara, the neighbors' daughter. And there was more: learning to cook Italian style, getting to know the country, providing hospitality to her friend Patti who was expecting a baby, having a love story, even if brief, with the very handsome Marcello.",

abstract="Wearable sensor devices play a key role for the wide adoption of pervasive and continuous healthcare monitoring systems. A first generation of wearable devices was represented by e-textile. A new generation of devices is instead represented by the so called Biomedical Wireless Sensor Networks (BWSN), that is ad-hoc networks of wireless devices deployed on (or in proximity of) the patients, e.g. in the form of sticking plasters, sensing various biomedical parameters and routing such values toward a datawarehousing system. While BWSNs result in a non-intrusive and flexible solution for continuous patient monitoring, they also introduce new challenges in preserving privacy and security of the collected sensitive data. In this paper we present an overview of BWSN related security issues and discuss the main approaches used to cope with them. In particular we analyze how Intrusion Detection Systems designed to protect generic Wireless Sensor Networks must be customized to be useful in the healthcare field. We also propose some modification to the applied IDS to better fit BWSN specific requirements and identify limits of the proposed approach paving the way for future work.",

abstract="This paper describes construction of a system for measurement of human position from laser range finders (LRFs) deployed in real home environment. The system gathers and stores scan data from LRF modules equipped with room corners at different hip heights by network. We also develop a tracking method based on a particle filter framework. In the filter, after scan data is subtracted with background data and noise data is eliminated with grid map that represents room layout, the position is estimated based on detected scan points with the filtering framework. This method realizes robust tracking of the occupant in real cluttered environment. We demonstrated the system can measure human position accurately in real home environment.",

abstract="Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a growing interdisciplinary area where the focus is shifted towards users instead of merely emphasizing the technological opportunities of AmI. Different methods are employed to understand the adoption of AmI appliances by users. However, these are often small-scale methods that are focused on specific subgroups. Large scale quantitative studies to understand the adoption of AmI appliances are scarce. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to examine how the Dutch people (n = 1221) perceive AmI appliances for domestic settings. Findings show that intention to adopt AmI appliances was low and that respondents had a negative to neutral attitude towards AmI appliances. On the basis of structural equation analysis, results suggest that adoption of AmI appliances could be explained by outcome expectancies of AmI appliances. The potential implications of the findings are discussed.",

abstract="Data Stream Management (DSM) addresses the continuous processing of sensor data. DSM requires the combination of stream operators, which may run on different distributed devices, into stream processes. Due to the recent advantages in sensor technologies and wireless communication, the amount of information generated by DSM will increase significantly. In order to efficiently deal with this streaming information, Digital Library (DL) systems have to merge with DSM systems. Especially in healthcare, the continuous monitoring of patients at home (telemonitoring) will generate a significant amount of information stored in an e-health digital library (electronic patient record). In order to stream-enable DL systems, we present an integrated data stream management and Digital Library infrastructure in this work. A vital requirement for healthcare applications is however that this infrastructure provides a high degree of reliability. In this paper, we present novel approaches to reliable DSM within a DL infrastructure. In particular, we propose information filtering operators, a declarative query engine called MXQuery, and efficient operator checkpointing to maintain high result quality of DSM. Furthermore, we present a demonstrator implementation of the integrated DSM and DL infrastructure, called OSIRIS-SE. OSIRIS-SE supports flexible and efficient failure handling to ensures complete and consistent continuous data stream processing and execution of DL processes even in the case of multiple failures.",

abstract="This chapter considers urban renewal policies involving Italian cities over the last 20 years with reference to public and private measures designed to resolve situations of environmental and socio-economic blight in degraded urban areas. Presenting a case-based empirical examination of private initiatives and public policies adopted by local government, the chapter seeks to verify the capacity for management of public funding by local government and to assess the important role played by the private sector in supporting public bodies in the process of urban regeneration and therefore on urban governance. Three case studies are analysed: two medium-sized cities in the South of Italy, Lecce and Taranto, and a large city in the North, Milan. The first two were the recipients, albeit in different periods, of EU funds linked to the ``urban'' initiative for the renewal of strategic urban areas and urban development. The sharp differences in the results achieved were essentially due to the management capacity of the local administrations and their public and private partners. Taranto was unable to achieve the envisaged urban regeneration, intended to reverse the consequences of poorly conceived industrial and military policies that were responsible for the devastation of the area. This contrasted with the more positive outcome of the urban renewal strategies adopted in Lecce, where public and private actors invested and continue to invest in the rebirth of the old town and the recovery and promotion of the city's cultural heritage. For Milan, the results are still being evaluated. In many cases, the partnership of public and private sectors facilitated the success of the strategies and measures adopted for the renewal of central and semi-central portions of the city (once occupied by industries or by infrastructure that had become obsolete). Over the last few years, the budgets of local bodies, together with their responsibilities in terms of orientation and monitoring of regional transformation processes implemented in concert with private players, have increasingly highlighted the need for public administrations to base their decisions on solid planning of priorities and management skills that are commensurate with the complexity of the measures to be implemented.",

abstract="This chapter deepens the discussion on postcolonial labour through a specific examination of labour employed in the logistical and infrastructural expansion of economies. Such an expansion requires labour ready at hand but not always necessary; labour at work but not visible; labour living but whenever required can soon be made dead. In this ghostly transformative exercise, money (increasingly in credit and digital mode) seems to be the most important tool. This chapter reminds us of the lesson Marx drew on the question of money in circulation---the supply chain of money---that it becomes a commodity like other commodities, appearing as forms of circulation of the same capital. Hence, even though money's function is one of capital, it appears as one of circulation---the spectral ``other'' of living labour in the postcolonial condition. Labour will follow the commodity chain, and will become a part of the commodity chain.",

However, through the actuation of devices and objects in the user's physical environment, pervasive computing also introduces other significant challenges to a user's physical privacy. Our research introduces an environment-centric approach to modeling user privacy and regulating intrusions to physical privacy. We introduce four principles to guide the construction of physical privacy policies and demonstrate how existing information privacy models can be extended to address these aspects of physical privacy.",

abstract="Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be taken as one of the principal test beds for the integration of Systems, Humans and Cybernetics. Multi-agent based Ambient Intelligence solutions have proliferated in the last few years in order to cope with the intrinsically distributed and complex interaction based nature of the problem. Different multi-agent platforms have been used in this regard, being JADE one of the standard solutions adopted due the variety of services it provides and to its FIPA compliance. Nevertheless, JADE was designed as a general Multi-agent platform and not for the particular demands of AmI systems. Consequently, its behavior in this realm is not as optimal as it could be. In this paper, we analyze some of the problems JADE presents for its application to AmI, especially in terms of communications, and describe some of the extensions we have developed in order to solve them. The resulting system exhibits enhanced communication capabilities, promotes the division of tasks into decoupled components and makes component reutilization easy. This platform constitutes an environment with tools for the development and deployment of AmI applications.",

abstract="Ambient agents react on humans on the basis of partial information obtained by sensoring. Appropriate types of reactions depend on in how far an ambient agent is able to interpret the available information (which is often incomplete, and hence multi-interpretable) in order to create a more complete internal image of the environment, including humans. This interpretation process, which often has multiple possible outcomes, can make use of an explicitly represented model of causal and dynamic relations. Given such a model representation, the agent needs a reasoning method to interpret the partial information available by sensoring, by generating one or more possible interpretations. This paper presents a generic model-based default reasoning method that can be exploited to this end. The method allows the use of software tools to determine the different default extensions that form the possible interpretations.",

abstract="The Superblock, an urban cell, when repeated creates a mosaic that extends throughout the city. It is an urban model that is used for new developments and regeneration. In the case of Barcelona, the Superblock forms the basis of an urban regeneration project. The Superblock is also one of the main technical instruments of Ecosystemic Urbanism. Ecosystemic Urbanism can deal with the new century challenges: sustainability in the age of information. It accommodates the laws of nature and the new metabolic regime. It also provides the urbanistic patterns to compete for information and knowledge. It is a basic tool that provides answers to the new paradigms that come with the change of time. Superblocks are a suitable solution for addressing the main dysfunctions and challenges that urban systems face today. This chapter will describe the Superblock paradigm in Barcelona.",

abstract="This chapter provides an overview of the development of higher education in the UAE and discusses how the digitalization and increased automation of world economies have led to calls for reinventing the university to respond to the profound shift in the type of skills needed for the future. In addition, soaring costs and reduced governments financial support are transforming HE into a private commodity rather than a public good. These developments have raised concerns about higher education effectiveness and affordability. This chapter addresses these two major global issues in the UAE context by reviewing the rapid evolution of UAE higher education and its sustainability in light of global, regional and local factors. Based on the competitive realities of the HE landscape locally, regionally and globally, and local demographic and socioeconomic factors, a more proactive national approach to international student recruitment is needed. The chapter also argues that the prevalent discourse on defining HE's role only as a producer of human resources for the economy is too reductionist and should not be the only basis for curricular reforms.",

We are concerned with Activities of Daily Living(ADL) of these residents and installed into a group home a sensor network as a pilot study to record and analyze their whereabouts. Twenty one antennas were placed under mats and five residents wore slippers into which Radio Frequency IDentification(RFID) tags were inserted. We collected location data for thirty months and looked for long term tendencies in their activities. We found that the information concerning their whereabouts may indicate their waning health conditions and may reflect caregivers' treatment. We also found a seasonal effect on residents' mobilities, a decline in summer. The result shows that location data may be exploited as a valuable source to recognize residents' slowly changing conditions.",

Understanding individual arguments and to reach a high usage rate of these vehicles in the public and a broad acceptance, the identification of possible pro-using motives as well as perceived drawbacks is essential, which would allow a sensitive and individually-tailored communication and information policy. Using an exploratory approach, a questionnaire study was carried out in which participants were requested to indicate the level of acceptance and the intention to use electric cars. The questionnaire items were taken from several focus groups, which had been carried out prior to the questionnaire study. Outcomes show that the traditional car is perceived still as much more comfortable, and receives a high trustfulness in comparison to electric cars. In addition, user diversity in terms of age and gender was found to considerably the perceived benefits and barriers. Female users but also aged persons show a higher level of acceptance, which might be due to their higher environmental consciousness in contrast to male persons and younger participants. Interestingly, the self-reported level of domain knowledge (significantly higher in men) did not show a large influence on the level of acceptance.",

However, the small number of training samples and their primitive representation often complicates the learning task. In order to correctly infer inhabitant's behavior a long time of observation and data collection is needed. This article suggests the use of MFE3/GA{\$}^{\{}D{\backslash}!R{\}}{\$}, an evolutionary constructive induction method. Constructive induction has been used to improve learning accuracy through transforming the primitive representation of data into a new one where regularities are more apparent. The use of MFE3/GA{\$}^{\{}D{\backslash}!R{\}}{\$}is expected to improve the representation of data and behavior learning process in an intelligent environment. The results of the research show that by applying MFE3/GA{\$}^{\{}D{\backslash}!R{\}}{\$}a standard learner needs considerably less data to correctly infer user's behavior.",

A list of design guidelines has been proposed and implemented in our system, addressing the needs of designing a multimodal interfaces for elderly persons. Meanwhile, the central component of an interactive system, the dialogue manager, has been developed according to a unified dialogue modelling method, which combines the conventional recursive transition network based generalized dialogue models and the classic agent-based dialogue theory, and supported by a formal language based development toolkit. In order to evaluate the minutely developed multimodal interactive system, the touch and speech input modalities of the current system were evaluated by an elaborated experimental study with altogether 31 elderly. The overall positive results on the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of both modalities confirm our proposed guidelines, approaches and frameworks on interactive system development. Despite the slightly different results, there is no significant evidence for one preferred modality. Thus, further study of their combination is considered necessary.",

There are four different types of motion that were simulated by non-patient volunteers. About 10,000 experimental motions of subjects were performed. Sensor data by human motions were collected and preprocessed by a moving average filter, transformed by FFT, and classified by the k-NN algorithm with k = 1.

In this work, we propose a stone-type physiological sensing device for general users, rather than professional experts. We found that our device was comfortable, stable and had aesthetic appeal for users during monitoring. To develop an affective shape, and to increase comfort, we applied a user-centered design process. We also used context-based physiological signal analysis to obtain stable analysis results according to individual users. As an application, we developed a rainbow ambient display to give visual feedback to users. We expect that this product can be applied in various healthcare applications.",

In this project we aim at providing an automated, non-intrusive, and effective solution for patients diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's as well as ease of mind to their caregiver. Through this assistive platform, time and vicinity based pre-recorded instructions by the caregiver on how to employ certain home appliances are played out upon detection of the patient's presence in the vicinity of the appliances. A log of the time and the kind of patient's activity is reported back to the caregiver for their reference. In addition, the system will be used to monitor and track the location of the patient which can be used by the caregiver for assessment purposes. Upon completion, this project will significantly reduce the cost associated with assisted living, as it will replace numerous expensive devices on the market and drastically improve the quality of life for both the caregivers and the patients suffering from Dementia internationally.",

abstract="Because of cognitive problems, it is very difficult for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to manage their time. Consequently, they are dependent on their caregivers or use pen-and-paper organizers, both of which have limitations. A more interesting alternative could be an electronic organizer that optimizes the functional autonomy of persons with AD. This article describes the development of an electronic organizer called AP@LZ by an interdisciplinary team of computer specialists and clinicians. The results show how knowledge of technology and knowledge of the cognitive capacities of persons with AD can be combined. A pre-experimental phase confirmed that AP@LZ was easy to use by elderly participants.",

abstract="The design of automated systems for the recognition of specific human activities is among the most promising research activities in Ambient Intelligence. The literature suggests the adoption of wearable devices, relying on acceleration information to model the activities of interest and distance metrics for the comparison of such models with the run-time data. Most current solutions do not explicitly model the uncertainty associated with the recognition, but rely on crisp thresholds and comparisons which introduce brittleness and inaccuracy in the system. We propose a framework for the recognition of simple activities in which recognition uncertainty is modelled using possibility distributions. We show that reasoning about this explicitly modelled uncertainty leads to a system with enhanced recognition accuracy and precision.",

We aimed to test if virtual training in multitasking games could result in better performance in brief neuropsychological time and place orientation, attention, memory, language, and arithmetic skills. The sample consisted of 31 independently living older adults. The virtual training group completed interactive activities in multitasking games, whereas the control group engaged in physical activities for aerobic resistance, speed, and balance.

abstract="In order to be accepted by users, one of the most important requirement for any assisted living technology is unobtrusiveness. This is particularly true when this technology is intended for continuous monitoring of vital signs, since traditional approaches require the subject to be tethered to measurement devices. The radar sensing is a very promising technology, enabling the measurement of vital signs at a distance, and thus meeting both requirements of unobtrusiveness and accuracy. In particular, impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar has attracted considerable attention in recent years thanks to many properties that make it useful for assisted living purposes. The aim of this paper is to investigate such radar technology for vital signs monitoring in assisted living scenarios. An algorithmic framework for the detection of respiration and heart rates during various activities of daily living is presented, including a method for compensation of movements of both the monitored subject and a second person present in the same environment (e.g., family member, caregiver, etc.). Experiments are carried out in various conditions that can be frequently encountered in assisted living scenarios. The reported results show that vital signs can be detected also while carrying out ADLs, with accuracy varying according to the level of movements and kind of involved body's parts and postures.",

We then describe what new metrics were defined and how metrics have been used in the last 7 years, which range from assessments of accessibility awareness, of accessibility progress, to in-depth analyses within the banking sector, in country-based and continent-based assessments. We illustrate metrics that use new kinds of data, like human judgements or questionnaires, that in some case are used to deal with validity and reliability of metrics.

In order to expand the observation area the depth sensor has been mounted on a pan-tilt motorized head. If the person acceleration is above a preset threshold the system uses a lying pose detector as well as examines a dynamic feature to authenticate the fall. Thus, more costly fall authentication is not executed frame-by-frame, but instead we fetch from a circular buffer a sequence of depth maps acquired prior to the fall and then process them to confirm fall alert.

abstract="Urbanisation is often celebrated as a gateway to expanded economic social and political opportunities for women, as well as greater possibilities for independent upward mobility. This is one plausible reason why, in the context of increased fetishisation of the city as a generator of wealth and well-being, the issue of gender and urban prosperity has come to the fore, being the theme of UN-Habitat's State of Women in Cities 2012/13 (UN-Habitat, 2013). Yet while not denying that urban women enjoy some advantages over their rural counterparts, barriers to female `empowerment' remain widespread in towns and cities of the Global South, especially among the urban poor.

abstract="We present a sensor network testbed that monitors a hallway. It consists of 120 load sensors and 29 passive infrared sensors (PIRs), connected to 30 wireless sensor nodes. There are also 29 LEDs and speakers installed, operating as actuators, and enabling a direct interaction between the testbed and passers-by. Beyond that, the network is heterogeneous, consisting of three different circuit boards---each with its specific responsibility. The design of the load sensors is of extremely low cost compared to industrial solutions and easily transferred to other settings. The network is used for in-network data processing algorithms, offering possibilities to develop, for instance, distributed target-tracking algorithms. Special features of our installation are highly correlated sensor data and the availability of miscellaneous sensor types.",

abstract="When it comes to user interaction elderly and people with special needs have special requirements, that evolve over time. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) envisions ubiquitous, intuitive human-machine interaction running on heterogeneous devices (tablets, televisions, smart-phones, etc.) and by means of multiple modalities (graphics, voice, gesture recognition, etc.). This vision often represents a strong technological challenge for any developer of AAL services. In order to relieve the developer from the burden of repeatedly adapting the interfaces, the universAAL platform [6] offers a framework for user interaction that separates the content, that is exchanged between the user and the application, and its actual representation. The main drawback of this solution is that it delegates all the responsibility of the representation of the content to the platform, which, in turn, must be able to adapt to all kinds of showable messages. This paper explains how a so-called UI Handler has been designed and implemented to render messages in universAAL, as well as the results of its technical and usability evaluations.",

abstract="Urbanisation is often celebrated as a gateway to expanded economic social and political opportunities for women, as well as greater possibilities for independent upward mobility. This is one plausible reason why, in the context of increased fetishisation of the city as a generator of wealth and well-being, the issue of gender and urban prosperity has come to the fore, being the theme of UN-Habitat's State of Women in Cities 2012/13 (UN-Habitat, 2013). Yet while not denying that urban women enjoy some advantages over their rural counterparts, barriers to female `empowerment' remain widespread in towns and cities of the Global South, especially among the urban poor. Indeed, that several gender inequalities and injustices persist in urban environments is highlighted all the more when considering prosperity in conjunction with poverty. An analysis encompassing both phenomena reveals the frequently stark contrasts between what women contribute to wealth in cities through their paid and unpaid labour, their endeavours in building and consolidating shelter, and their efforts to work around shortfalls in essential services and infrastructure, and the often limited rewards they reap in respect of equitable access to `decent' work and living standards, human capital acquisition, physical and financial assets, personal safety and security, and representation in formal structures of urban governance (Chant, 2013).",

abstract="Dynamically adaptive systems (DASs) are intended to monitor the execution environment and then dynamically adapt their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. The uncertainty of the execution environment is a major motivation for dynamic adaptation; it is impossible to know at development time all of the possible combinations of environmental conditions that will be encountered. To date, the work performed in requirements engineering for a DAS includes requirements monitoring and reasoning about the correctness of adaptations, where the DAS requirements are assumed to exist. This paper introduces a goal-based modeling approach to develop the requirements for a DAS, while explicitly factoring uncertainty into the process and resulting requirements. We introduce a variation of threat modeling to identify sources of uncertainty and demonstrate how the RELAX specification language can be used to specify more flexible requirements within a goal model to handle the uncertainty.",

Most of the research effort has been focused on direct recognition from accelerometer sensors and few studies have integrated the audio channel in their model despite the fact that it is a sensor that is always available on all kinds of smartphones. In this study, we show that audio features bring an important performance improvement over an accelerometer based approach. Moreover, the study demonstrates the interest of considering the smartphone location for on-line context-aware AR and the prediction power of audio features for this task. Finally, another contribution of the study is the collected corpus that is made available to the community for AR recognition from audio and accelerometer sensors.",

abstract="We present a system for automatic annotation of daily experience from multisensory streams on smartphones. Using smartphones as platform facilitates collection of naturalistic daily activity, which is difficult to collect with multiple on-body sensors or array of sensors affixed to indoor locations. However, recognizing daily activities in unconstrained settings is more challenging than in controlled environments: 1) multiples heterogeneous sensors equipped in smartphones are noisier, asynchronous, vary in sampling rates and can have missing data; 2) unconstrained daily activities are continuous, can occur concurrently, and have fuzzy onset and offset boundaries; 3) ground-truth labels obtained from the user's self-report can be erroneous and accurate only in a coarse time scale. To handle these problems, we present in this paper a flexible framework for incorporating heterogeneous sensory modalities combined with state-of-the-art classifiers for sequence labeling. We evaluate the system with real-life data containing 11721 minutes of multisensory recordings, and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system for practical lifelogging applications.",

This chapter explains how, to the effects of this study, data mining techniques were applied to perform an analysis of medical opinions about the practice of autopsies in a hospital of Veracruz, Mexico. These opinions were obtained from a survey, applied to 85 doctors of the hospital. The application of data mining techniques allowed the construction of a model, which is represented by a set of rules. The rules suggest some factors that are related to the decrease of the realization of autopsies in the hospital. All this was achieved in a framework where support and confidence thresholds were applied. Likewise, the results were refined by the addition of an objective statistic measure, named Lift, which helps filter out uninteresting association rules.",

But even with this forward momentum, there persists an erroneous belief that, while the Dutch can provide encouragement, their methods are unrepeatable and results unattainable. Miles of dedicated cycle tracks, bike streets, and off-street bikeways are something that only works for ``them'' and not ``us.'' However, as Janette Sadik-Khan has implied, even the Netherlands had to start somewhere. So can the country that has spent decades building comfortable cycling infrastructure provide a blueprint for North American cities?",

This paper describes a probabilistic framework for the fusion of data from a laser range finder on a mobile robot and an overhead camera fixed in a domestic environment. The contribution of the framework is that it enables seamless integration with other sensors. For tracking multiple people it is possible to use a probabilistic particle filter tracker. We show that the fusion improves the results of the individual subsystems.",

abstract="In the last few years, ontologies have been successfully exploited by Decision Support Systems (DSSs) to support some phases of the decisionmaking process. In this paper, we propose to employ an ontological representation for all the content both processed and produced by a DSS in answering requests. This semantic representation supports the DSS in the whole decisionmaking process, and it is capable of encoding (i) the request, (ii) the data relevant for it, and (iii) the conclusions/suggestions/decisions produced by the DSS. The advantages of using an ontology-based representation of the main data structure of a DSS are many: (i) it enables the integration of heterogeneous sources of data available in the web, and to be processed by the DSS, (ii) it allows to track, and to expose in a structured form to additional services (e.g., explanation or case reuse services), all the content processed and produced by the DSS for each request, and (iii) it enables to exploit logical reasoning for some of the inference steps of the DSS decision-making process. The proposed approach have been successfully implemented and exploited in a DSS for personalized environmental information, developed in the context of the PESCaDO EU project.",

abstract="Movement-based and exertion interfaces assume that their users move. Users have to perform exercises, they have to dance, they have to golf or football, or they want to train particular bodily skills. Many examples of those interfaces exist, sometimes asking for subtle interaction between user and interface and sometimes asking for `brute force' exertion interaction between user and interface. In these interfaces it is often the case that the interface mediates between players of a game. Obviously, one of the players may be a virtual human. We provide a `state of the art survey' of such interfaces and in particular look at intelligent exertion interfaces, interfaces that know about their users and even try to anticipate what their users prepare to do. That is, we embed this interface research in ambient intelligence and entertainment computing research, and the interfaces we consider are not only mediating, but they also `add' intelligence to the game. Other issues that will be discussed are `flow' and `engagement' for exertion interfaces. Intelligent exertion interfaces, being able to know and learn about their users, should also be able to provide means to keep their users engaged and in the flow of the game and entertainment experience. Unlike the situation with traditional desktop game research where we can observe lots of research activity trying to define, interpret and evaluate issues such as `flow' and `immersion', in movement-based interfaces these concepts need to be reconsidered and new ways of evaluation have to be defined.",

Continuous monitoring and information processing tools are vital to a physician with several patients under his care. In this work, a system that relies on agents and mobile and wireless devices is presented. Its use with small scale sensors allows to collect and analyse vital data in real-time, triggering appropriate reactions in case of eminent danger. This includes real-time notifications to practitioners. In cases in which the physician is unable to divide his attention among all his patients, the system is able to drive his attention to one patient only and, when it is necessary, to another one, according to their medical state. This concept represents a breakthrough in terms of the physician's time and task management, being possible to apply it two major scenarios: patient recovery in a hospital environment or elderly living alone in a domestic environment. In that sense, we present a brief contextualiation of the problem as well as the architecture and technologies used to implement the proposed work.",

Offline, the ECGs recorded from the WE were examined and the number of R wave peaks for each subject where counted by a human observer. This count served as the gold standard. A computer program was used to detect R peaks from both the WE and TE. Sensitivity of each system was determined by comparing computer program based heart rates from WE and TE to the gold standard. The system with TE obtained a mean sensitivity of 76.47{\%}. This was significantly lower than with WE (mean: 98.19{\%}).

The present study provides an overview about the methods currently applied to the definition and development of AUIs. In order to study and develop adaptive user interfaces with the purpose to guarantee socialization, safety and environmental sustainability in a domestic day-by-day living space, a new method of holistic and adaptive user interface is proposed to support the modeling of information related to the user and the context of the interaction. In order to generate the user profiles, subjects older than 40 years with different levels of technology affinity will be considered. These prototypes will be tested through different use cases in the context of smart home environments.

The problem of learning relational structure for sequence labeling can be posed as learning Markov Logic Networks (MLN) for sequence labeling, which we abbreviate as Markov Logic Chains (MLC). This objective in propositional space can be solved efficiently and optimally by a Hierarchical Kernels based approach, referred to as StructRELHKL, which we recently proposed. However, the applicability of StructRELHKL in complex first order settings is non-trivial and challenging. We present the challenges and possibilities for optimally and simultaneously learning the structure as well as parameters of MLCs (as against learning them separately and/or greedily). Here, we look into leveraging the StructRELHKL approach for optimizing the MLC learning steps to the extent possible. To this end, we categorize first order MLC features based on their complexity and show that complex features can be constructed from simpler ones. We define a self-contained class of features called absolute features ({\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}AF{\}}{\$}), which can be conjoined to yield complex MLC features. Our approach first generates a set of relevant {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}AF{\}}{\$}s and then makes use of the algorithm for StructRELHKL to learn their optimal conjunctions. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by evaluating on a publicly available activity recognition dataset.",

abstract="Our ultimate goal is to develop autonomous mobile home healthcare robots which closely monitor and evaluate the patients' motor function, and their at-home training therapy process, providing automatically calling for medical personnel in emergency situations. In our previous study, we developed basic algorithms for tracking, measuring, and behavior recognition of human subjects by a mobile robot, thus, demonstrated the feasibility of the idea of bio-monitoring home healthcare mobile robots. In this study, in order to realize effective bio-monitoring robots, we investigated 1) color based particle filter subject tracking with proposed depth likelihood integration to control the weights of particles; 2) control schemes for acquiring stable image sources for further human motion analysis, especially, the algorithms for reducing the camera vibration due to the acceleration and deceleration of the robot; 3) human activity recognition using contour data of the tracked human subjects extracted from depth images. Results showed that, depending on depth data can be quite useful as an observation by simplifying state space in 2D rather than 3D state space, and, a fuzzy control algorithm could decrease the vibration due to the acceleration and deceleration. Finally, the human activity recognition could be achieved with a high correct rate, by using geometric parameters extracted from contour data.",

abstract="Creating rewarding and resonant user experiences usually requires a designerly approach, that is, to explore multiple ideas and later converge to a specific design outcome that can be eventually implemented. Engaging novice designers as well as end users in fuzzy ideation processes can cause participants' discouragement and disengagement when they do not understand the goal of the various design tasks and the contribution of such tasks to the whole development process. To mitigate this problem, we propose two software tools (called CoDICE and ECCE) to support the ideation, design and early prototyping of augmented experiences. The tools make it possible to apply generative techniques to promote creativity whilst providing a virtual space where ideas and designs can be persistently documented and developed further. The creation of physical prototypes is supported to close the loop, thus enabling end users to ideate, design and prototype their own augmented experiences. Tools were tested with end users who valued (i) to have a process flow to follow, (ii) to be able to explore multiples ideas and interrelate them and, finally, (iii) to create their own working prototypes.",

abstract="Social interaction is crucial for psychological wellbeing. However, for the elderly, desiring to live independently in their homes for as long as possible, getting the emotional care needed can become challenging. Robots as social companions may help. To design companions, we argue to focus on the hybrid nature of robots in between being a ``thing'' and a ``human'' thus utilizing the unique ``capabilities'' of a robot. We discuss six psychological superpowers of robots rooted in their ``thingness'' rather than ``humanness.'' Robots are void of competitiveness, have endless patience, can be unconditionally subordinated, have the ability to contain themselves, do not take things personally and can assume responsibility. These qualities all relate to everyday companionship, but may be difficult to actually realize for fellow humans. By exploiting these superpowers, robot companions can become meaningful -- not as a substitute for other humans, but as a novel, complementary form of social interaction.",

Born of changes in the broader political context and the policy environment, the Ulwazi Programme is a new South African heritage initiative that has been set up by the eThekwini Municipal Library's Libraries and Heritage Department to preserve and disseminate indigenous knowledge of local communities in the greater Durban area. The Programme, in the form of a localized Wiki, functions as a collaborative online archive of local knowledge and histories that are collected from the community by volunteer fieldworkers and then shared via the Internet and on cell phones. This utilization of a combination of open-source and social media applications for archival and heritage purposes is unique in South Africa.

We use a waist- mounted tri-axial accelerometer to capture movement data of the human body, and propose a fall detection method that uses the area under a signal magnitude curve to distinguish between falls and daily activities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed scheme with high reliability and sensitivity on fall detection. The system is not only cost effective but also portable that fulfills the requirements of fall detection.",

abstract="Activity recognition performance is significantly dependent on the accuracy of the underlying activity model. Therefore, it is essential to examine and develop an activity model that can capture and represent the complex nature of human activities precisely. To address this issue, we introduce a new activity modeling technique, which utilizes simple yet often ignored activity semantics. Activity semantics are highly evidential knowledge that can identify an activity more accurately in ambiguous situations. We classify semantics into three types and apply them to generic activity framework, which is a refined hierarchical composition structure of the traditional activity theory. We compare the introduced activity model with the traditional model and the hierarchical models in terms of attainable recognition certainty. The comparison study shows superior performance of our semantic model using activities of daily living scenario.",

abstract="Inferring community mobility of patients from GPS data has received much attention in health research. Developing robust mobility (or physical activity) monitoring systems relies on the automated algorithm that classifies GPS track points into events (such as stops where activities are conducted, and routes taken) accurately. This paper describes the method that automatically extracts community mobility measures from GPS track data. The method uses temporal DBSCAN in classifying track points, and temporal filtering in removing noises (any misclassified track points). The result shows that the proposed method classifies track points with 88{\%} accuracy. The percent of misclassified track points decreased significantly with our method (1.9{\%}) over trip/stop detection based on attribute threshold values (10.58{\%}).",

abstract="Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) consists of a large number of distributed sensor nodes. Wireless sensor networks are offering the next evolution in biometrics and healthcare monitoring applications. The present paper proposes a congestion control protocol based on the learning automata which prevents the congestion by controlling the source rate. Furthermore, a new active queue management mechanism is developed. The main objective of the proposed active queue management mechanism is to control and manage the entry of each packet to sensor nodes based on learning automata. The proposed system is able to discriminate different physiological signals and assign them different priorities. Thus, it would be possible to provide better quality of service for transmitting highly important vital signs. The simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol improves system throughput and reduces delay and packet dropping.",

The knowledge extracted by this analysis is used to create a model of normal electricity consumption behavior for each particular household. Initially, the household's electricity consumption data are partitioned into a number of clusters with similar daily electricity consumption profiles. The centroids of the generated clusters can be considered as representative signatures of a household's electricity consumption behavior. The proposed approach is evaluated by conducting a number of experiments on electricity consumption data of ten selected households. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is suitable for data organizing and understanding, and can be applied for modeling electricity consumption behavior on a household level.",

Despite the faded reputation of psychoanalysis, and the rise of cognitive science, depth psychology in modernized form must be central to this novel response to death. Administration of afterlife questions from the General Social Survey to members of a radical group show how cultures and subcultures both shape individuals. Thus, capture must involve not only the individual, but to some degree the surrounding society as well, and emulation must benefit other people. Five scenarios for the future of personality capture and emulation range from radical to modest: (1) Transmigration: the transfer of human personalities to a new substrate at high fidelity, (2) Apotheosis: creation of an idealized functioning model of an individual person, (3) Progeny: representing a person through multiple agents during the lifetime as well as afterward, (4) Incorporation: providing partial immortality by embedding a person into the collective memory of the community, and (5) Personalization: adjustment of an individual's tools to reflect personal beliefs, values, and skills.",

The developed system utilizes background domain knowledge about the user activities and the environment in combination with probabilistic reasoning methods in order to build best possible explanation of the observed stream of sensor events. The main advantage over traditional methods, e.g. dynamic Bayesian models, lies in the ability to deploy the solution in different environments without needing to undergo a training phase. To demonstrate this, tests with recorded data sets from two ambient intelligence labs have been conducted. The results show that even using basic semantic modeling of how the user behaves and how his/her behavior is reflected in the environment, it is possible to draw conclusions about the certainty and the frequencies with which certain activities are performed.",

Although powerful, when using BN we have to deal with the construction of the BN structure which happens to be a complex task because of the customized service offered by the DIY-AIDE system. To overcome this challenge, we developed the AAL-based Bayesian Network Construction Algorithm (AAL-BNCA).

However, recognizing relevant human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data mining approaches. In this paper, we present a comparison study for HAR using features selection methods to reduce the training and classification time while maintaining significant performance. In fact, due to the limited resources of Smartphones, reducing the feature set helps reducing computation costs, especially for real-time continuous online applications. We validated our approach on a publicly available dataset to classify six different activities.

These systems take external information and attempt to deduce user intentions from the context of use, without requiring or allowing direct feedback from the user. For this reason, it remains unclear whether the system's behavior was in accordance with the user's intentions -- leading to problems in the interaction between human and adaptive technology. The goal of the EMOIO project is to overcome potential barriers of use with the aid of neuroscientific methods. Merging ergonomics with the neurosciences into the new field of neuroergonomics research produces enormous potential for innovation, to make the symbiosis between humans and technology more intuitive. To this end, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a new generation of interfaces between humans and technology. BCIs make it possible to register mental states such as attention and emotions and transmit this information directly to a technological system. So-called neuroadaptive systems continuously use this information in order to adjust the behavior, functions or the content of an interactive system accordingly. A neuroadaptive system is being developed by a consortium of partners from research and industry as part of the EMOIO project. The goal of the system is to recognize, based on the users' brain activity, whether system-initiated behaviors are approved or rejected. The system is able to use this information to provide the person with the best possible assistance and thus adapt to individual and situational demands. To do this, neuroscientific methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are being evaluated with respect to their suitability for measuring emotions (approval/rejection).",

abstract="Software development has proven to be a challenge. To address this challenge, there are quite many interesting approaches how to develop software---starting from the waterfall approach, up to recently quite popular agile software development techniques. Another already some years old approach was described by the Gang of Four and proposes the usage of design patterns to provide a general reusable solution to commonly occurring problems in software development. Although design patterns have been around for a long time, their usability is still promising. To the best of our knowledge ``interdisciplinary patterns'' to address challenges in the development of context aware application in ubiquitous environments have not been described in literature so far. Hence, this chapter proposes and also evaluates concrete interdisciplinary software development patterns. To provide an application example the proposed patterns are used to address two use cases that commonly occur in the development process of context aware applications: providing transparency to the user and ensuring a user's self-determination. For the demonstration of the patterns Support-U a context aware application that provides elderly people to live autonomously is used.",

First, we examine the problem of supporting peripheral awareness, in order to improve both emotional well-being and awareness of family activity. This is based on a field study to determine the role and importance of various peripheral cues in different aspects of everyday activities. The results from the study were used to guide the design of our proposed augmented communications environment. Second, we consider the choice of mechanism to facilitate the on-demand transition to foreground communication in such an environment. The design suggests an expansion of Buxton's taxonomy of foreground and background interaction technologies to encompass a third class of peripheral communications.",

abstract="Movement-based interfaces assume that their users move. Users have to perform exercises, they have to dance, they have to golf or football, or they want to train particular bodily skills. Many examples of those interfaces exist, sometimes asking for subtle interaction between user and interface and sometimes asking for `brute force' interaction between user and interface. Often these interfaces mediate between players of a game. Obviously, one of the players may be a virtual human. We embed this interface research in ambient intelligence and entertainment computing research, and the interfaces we consider are not only mediating, but they also `add' intelligence to the interaction. Intelligent movement-based interfaces, being able to know and learn about their users, should also be able to provide means to keep their users engaged in the interaction. Issues that will be discussed in this chapter are `flow' and `immersion' for movement-based interfaces and we look at the possible role of interaction synchrony to measure and support engagement.",

abstract="In the last decade, research has increasingly focused on robots as autonomous agents that should be capable of adapting to open and changing environments. Developing, building and finally deploying technology of this kind require a broad range of ethical and legal considerations, including aspects regarding the robots' autonomy, their display of human-like communicative and collaborative behaviour, their characteristics of being socio-technical systems designed for the support of people in need, their characteristics of being devices or tools with different grades of technical maturity, the range and reliability of sensor data and the criteria and accuracy guiding sensor data integration, interpretation and subsequent robot actions. Some of the relevant aspects must be regulated by societal and legal discussion; others may be better cared for by conceiving robots as ethically aware agents. All of this must be considered against steadily changing levels of technical maturity of the available system components. To meet this broad range of goals, results are taken up from three recent initiatives discussing the ethics of artificial systems: the EPSRC Principles of Robotics, the policy recommendations from the STOA project Making Perfect Life and the MEESTAR instrument. While the EPSRC Principles focus on the tool characteristics of robots from a producer, user and societal/legal point of view, STOA Making Perfect Life addresses the pervasiveness, connectedness and increasing imperceptibility of new technology. MEESTAR, in addition, takes an application-centric perspective focusing on assistive systems for people in need.",

abstract="In the late 1960s, a generation of television viewers was introduced to the television show ``Star Trek.'' What made ``Star Trek'' so interesting was its ability to forecast many of the technologies that are now coming into use in health care. For example, did not the communicator that Captain Kirk used to frequently ask Scotty to beam him up look strikingly familiar to the cell phones, or handsets, that many physicians and hospital administrators carry around with them today? And what about the tricorder? It could easily be mistaken for a personal digital assistant. The ``Star Trek'' technology, much like the technology we are seeing today, foreshadowed the breakdown of the barriers between data collection and data storage by newer handheld technologies. When Dr. McCoy wanted to know a patient's vital signs, all he did was run a little sensor over the patient's body. Devices now exist that literally do the same thing for physicians, who, incidentally, may or may not be in the same room with the patient. Finally, in ``Star Trek,'' access to information was almost ubiquitous. When Captain Kirk needed important information, all he did was make a request of the computer, and the information was quickly and efficiently displayed. Systems such as computerized physician order entry (CPOE) hold the same promise for physicians who need immediate access to patient information, laboratory results, or the latest information on a new medication's dosage levels. This chapter will discuss some of the new and developing technologies that have the potential to shape the healthcare industry over the next decade. These technologies include CPOE, wireless/pervasive computing, biometrics, and customer relationship management.",

abstract="Activity Recognition (AR) is a subset of pervasive computing that attempts to identify physical actions performed by a user. Previous sensor-based AR systems involve computation and energy overheads incurred by the use of heterogeneous and large number of sensors, however it is possible to arrive at an optimized system where the design involves optimization of energy consumption through number of sensors, computation through minimal set of features and cost through a nominal hardware platform ideally making it a multidimensional optimization. The above mentioned modelling was reflected in the construction of this optimized system as the design employs a single accelerometer and extracts only 7 time-domain features resulting in ease of computation to classify the activities, thus encouraging it to be inherently deployable on an embedded platform. The system was trained and tested on the accelerometer data acquired from three publicly available datasets. The performance of four chosen machine learning based classification models from an initial set of eight was evaluated, analysed and ranked on the grounds of efficiency and computation. The model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero (USD 5) and the average time for feature computation and the maximum time taken to classify an instance of an activity was found to be 0.015 s and 1.094 s respectively, thus validating the viability of the system on an embedded platform and making it affordable to the population in the low-income groups.",

abstract="Human Activity Recognition has been primarily investigated as a machine learning classification task forcing it to handle with two main limitations. First, it must assume that the testing data has an equal distribution with the training sample. However, the inherent structure of an activity recognition systems is fertile in distribution changes over time, for instance, a specific person can perform physical activities differently from others, and even sensors are prone to misfunction. Secondly, to model the pattern of activities carried out by each user, a significant amount of data is needed. This is impractical especially in the actual era of Big Data with effortless access to public repositories. In order to deal with these problems, this paper investigates the use of Transfer Learning, specifically Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, within human activity recognition systems. The yielded experiment results reveal a useful transfer of knowledge and more importantly the convenience of transfer learning within human activity recognition. Apart from the delineated experiments, our work also contributes to the field of transfer learning in general through an exhaustive survey on transfer learning for human activity recognition based on wearables.",

We further evaluated the advantage of a model based approach over a static classifier, compared the individual contribution of each sensor type and could reach accuracy rates of 97{\%} and 85{\%}.",

abstract="This paper stresses the importance of monitoring indoor environment quality (IEQ) in a bedroom environment for the pre-elderly, by comparing data on sleep behavior with the corresponding IEQ variables. Although concerns regarding the influence of IEQ on residents' health are increasing, solutions for optimizing bedroom environments have not yet been determined. In particular, for the elderly and pre-elderly, optimization of the indoor environment may relieve the symptoms of chronic disease and degradation of their physical abilities. This study presents a method for obtaining basic data to create an optimized bedroom environment for the aging society.",

abstract="Patient satisfaction is an important metric for the evaluation of telemedicine applications to be able to provide patient-centred care. This paper analyses trends in patient satisfaction reporting of telemedicine applications, specifically comparing three telemedicine classes (store-and-forward, realtime consultation, telecare) and the two study stages of pilot and routine delivery. We also discuss the methods used to acquire satisfaction. This paper aims to challenge current approaches and provide recommendations on improving satisfaction evaluation of new telemedicine applications towards provision of patient-centred care. Literature searches were conducted for selected telemedicine studies which report measures of satisfaction from sources of Web of Knowledge and PubMed. Evaluations of patient satisfaction were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis reports that patient satisfaction evaluation is insufficient. However, an increased trend has been detected, which was most evident in the major growth area of telecare. Evaluations are not as actively performed in the routine delivery stage as the pilot stage. Our qualitative analysis found that measuring methods used are usually unsophisticated, poorly described, and often fails to allow patients to communicate their experience in a useful manner. Great attention must be paid to address overall deficiencies in the important area of patient satisfaction evaluation. Satisfaction evaluations are necessarily telemedicine class-specific with an emphasis on telecare applications. There is an obvious need to adopt standard methodologies for measuring satisfaction and ways of incorporating this into economic evaluation, to ensure comparability of data and applications, and not least to compel researchers to adopt an agreement on the dimensions of satisfaction to be evaluated.",

abstract="Three different instruction formats were examined respecting their usefulness for the navigation through hierarchical menus in mobile phones. 56 middle-aged adults had to solve four mobile phone tasks twice consecutively. Before completing the first trial, they were supported by instruction formats which contained different spatial knowledge types [28]. The first form was a procedural step-by-step instruction delivering landmark and route knowledge. The second instruction consisted of a visualized menu tree, in which the menu path to be taken was marked. By this, mainly survey knowledge but also route information was provided. The third instruction format also used the visualized menu tree. However, in addition to the menu path which had to be taken, also functions' labels were given, conveying landmark, route and survey knowledge. Further, a condition was examined in which no help was given. Dependent variables were navigation effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the step-by-step condition, the instruction type most often used in technical leaflets, had the smallest effect, especially for users with low spatial visualization abilities. With instruction forms which use diagrammatic visualizations and provide survey knowledge, navigation performance considerably improved.",

Recent studies have shown that the deployment of technological reminder based solutions, have to a certain extent, been capable of alleviating some of the issues associated with memory loss. Nevertheless, technical and usability challenges are still major hindering factors to large scale uptake. This work presents the details of the evaluation of a mobile phone based video reminding system with 4 persons suffering from mild dementia. We gathered 101 days worth of usability data during an evaluation period of 5 weeks along with a qualitative collection of pre and post evaluation questionnaires. The results from our evaluation have shown that out of 216 reminders delivered during the evaluation period only 18 of them were not acknowledged by the persons with dementia. Upon examining the post-evaluations, it was found that the carers played a significant role in terms of the success of the solution and that an initial settling in period of on average 14 days was required before users felt comfortable using the technology.",

To demonstrate the system, we developed a wireless sensor network composed of Raspberry Pi boards with microphones as nodes. The audio classification system results to an accuracy of 83.79{\%} using a parallel network for the Urban8k dataset, extracting constant-Q transform (CQT) features as system inputs. The overall system is scalabale and flexible in terms of the number of nodes, hence it is applicable on wide areas where assisted living applications are utilized.",

Our approach uses inexpensive pressure sensors, placed in a specific manner, that allows us to identify multiple people. Given this information, our algorithm can track multiple people across the floor even in the presence of large sensor error. The algorithm we develop is evaluated for a variety of different movement patterns that include turning and path crossing. The error in correct path detection is shown to be very small even in the most complex movement scenario. We note that our algorithm does not use any a priori information such as weight, rfid tags, knowledge of number of people, etc.",

Lighting represents on average about 15 {\%} of the annual electricity bill excluding gas and hot water. Different studies have been made to reduce the electrical energy consumption like automatic switching and time programming. But all these techniques have not an important rate in reducing the electrical energy consumption. So we note that an intelligent lighting which varies with the users need remains important source of economy of the energy. The intelligent lighting is obtained by using ambient intelligence (AmI). Multi agent System (MAS) have become the important paradigm to develop an ambient system because they have important characteristics like autonomy, proactivity and mobility to respond better to the main characteristic of ambient intelligence like the adaptability to the context. In this area, we propose an adaptive and intelligent lighting system in which each light source is represented by a software agent and the set of agents compose and coordinate their competences in order to illuminate a region with minimum energy consumption.",

We outline different paradigms to describe the role of social robots in communication processes with humans, and connect HRI with the topic of persuasive technology in health care, to critically reflect the potential benefits of using social robots as persuasive agents. The ability of a robotic system to conform to the demands (behaviors, understanding, roles, and tasks) that arise from the place the robot is designed to perform, affect the user and his/er sense of place attachment. Places are constantly changing, and so do interactions, thus robotic systems should continually adjust to change by modifying their behavior accordingly.",

abstract="This research aims to achieve the resident-centered community design by utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), and to create a trigger to regain rich relationship within a community by visualizing media spots which is defined as places where residents communicate much more than the other areas. In order to improve the media spot estimation method proposed by the previous research, we extracted and analyzed location information under various conditions. As a result, we could confirm that a portion of the highest density of location information corresponds to a resident's home place, and found that a home place can be accurately derived irrespective of the scattering in accuracy. Also, the analysis on how the distribution of location information varies depending on time zone suggests that it is necessary to use location information which is minutely divided in time or aggregated every day of the week.",

In this work, an occlusion robust method is presented based on two features: human centroid height relative to the ground and body velocity. Indeed, the first feature is an efficient solution to detect falls as the vast majority of falls ends on the ground or near the ground. However, this method can fail if the end of the fall is completely occluded behind furniture. Fortunately, these cases can be managed by using the 3D person velocity computed just before the occlusion.",

abstract="With the emerging advancements in computer vision and pattern recognition, methods for human activity recognition have become increasingly accessible. In this paper, we present a robust approach for human activity recognition which uses the open source library OpenPose to extract anatomical key points from RGB images. We further use these key points to extract robust motion features considering their movements in consecutive frames'. Then, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory cells (LSTM) is used to recognize the activities associated with these features. To make the approach person-independent, different subjects from different camera angles are used. The proposed method shows promising performance, with the best result reaching an overall accuracy of 92.4{\%} on a publicly available activity data set, which outperforms the conventional approaches (i.e. support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests) which achieve maximum accuracy of 78.5{\%}. The proposed activity recognition system can contribute in prominent research fields such as image processing and computer vision with practical applications such as caregiving for older people to help them live more independently.",

In this system, we cope with not only the user's physical location but also all the situations of pervasive devices and requirements of associated users, in ``both'' sides of watching and watched sites. Moreover, social relationships between observers and a watched person are used to give an adequate privacy level to the services. To do this, we propose a pervasive watching over system ``uEyes''. In uEyes we introduce three distinguished features for the watching, they are (S1) Device awareness, (S2) User awareness and (S3) Social awareness. To realize these features, an autonomous decision making ability and cooperative behavior are employed to each element in the system. Based on these advanced features, a live video streaming system is autonomously constructed according to the device status and the user's situation, on both sides in runtime. As a result, the gentle watching-over service can be effectively provided.",

abstract="Automated activity recognition systems that use probabilistic models require labeled data sets in training phase for learning the model parameters. The parameters are different for every person and every environment. Therefore, for every person or environment, training is needed to be performed from scratch. Obtaining labeled data requires much effort therefore poses challenges on the large scale deployment of activity recognition systems. Active learning can be a solution to this problem. It is a machine learning technique that allows the algorithm to choose the most informative data points to be annotated. Because the algorithm selects the most informative data points, the amount of the labeled data needed for training the model is reduced. In this study, we propose using active learning methods for activity recognition. We use three different informativeness measures for selecting the most informative data points and evaluate their performances using three real world data sets recorded in a home setting. We show through experiments that the required number of data points is reduced by 80{\%} in House A, 73{\%} in House B, and 66{\%} in House C with active learning.",

In order to address the complexity, the used infrastructure must be interoperable and independent of underlying platform and must consider sensor observations in a uniform manner. This paper focuses on adapting a RESTful architecture for OGC's SWE services. This is done in order to overcome the limitations of SWE. The major limitations are associated with the architecture design and data format and this paper addresses these issues by implementing the different SWE services using RESTful architecture. The reason for this proposal is the fact that sensor nodes can be observed as RESFful resources and they are made attainable through SWE services and can be queried over SWE services. Another reasonable fact behind this proposal is that JSON data format which is lightweight can be used instead of XML in order to exchange messages; which can be a better extension for SWE. The performance analysis shows the advantage of using JSON notation instead of XML in terms of file size reduction.",

AAL is founded on increasing needs for welfare technologies, as well as on significant effort from many scientific disciplines, the society, and the industry. The research has so far been primarily concentrated on elicitation of the functional aspects and on providing the technical solutions for the AAL systems and services. The problem of eliciting non-functional requirements and quality characteristics that are specific and critical for AAL, however, has been addressed to a much lesser extent. Failing to ensure the necessary system and service quality regarding critical characteristics may represent a significant obstacle to the wider acceptance of AAL in the society. There is hence a need to increase awareness of quality of AAL systems and services by providing the necessary supplement to the established state of the art. This paper reports on the process and the results from elicitation of AAL specific quality characteristics. The approach is based on established reference architectures and roadmapping material, as well as the ISO/IEC 9126 software product quality standard. The paper demonstrates how to do the elicitation in practice, and proposes the set of quality characteristics that are most important in the AAL context.",

abstract="Aiming at the problem of a mobile robot searching human in home environments, a gird model is built and a path planning method based on a modified genetic algorithm and an improved A* algorithm is proposed. First, the grid map is divided into several unit regions using Boustrophedon cellular decomposition. Then, a unit region planning method based on a genetic algorithm is applied to generate a region transition sequence, and an effective strategy to search every region is adjusted according to the robot's sensors. Meanwhile, the optimal path between two points is generated by an improved A* algorithm, so that the path is much shorter and the number of turns is greatly reduced. Finally, the simulation results verify that this method can provide an optimized path in known home environments effectively, based on that the robot can find human in the shortest possible time.",

abstract="Africa's rapid urbanization provides opportunities for economies of scale and agglomeration, but it will also call for large investments in infrastructures to respond to the increased demand for urban accessibility. For cities to act as integrated labour markets and match jobs seekers and employers, they need to make employment spatially accessible to all residents. Economies of scale and agglomeration are, indeed, greater in cities where mobility infrastructures are able to respond accessibility needs with higher access to markets and resources than those where people's mobility is impeded by deficient mobility infrastructures. Demand for accessibility and mobility depends first on how the cities are designed in terms of urban form and structure. Urban form and structure depend on how the cities are planned in terms of (mixed) land use, compactness, densities, and street planning and design among other factors.",

abstract="This paper presents a human daily activity classification approach based on the sensory data collected from a single tri-axial accelerometer worn on waist belt. The classification algorithm was realized to distinguish 6 different activities including standing, jumping, sitting-down, walking, running and falling through three major steps: wavelet transformation, Principle Component Analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction and followed by implementing a radial basis function (RBF) kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Two trials were conducted to evaluate different aspects of the classification scheme. In the first trial, the classifier was trained and evaluated by using a dataset of 420 samples collected from seven subjects by using a k-fold cross-validation method. The parameters $\sigma$ and c of the RBF kernel were optimized through automatic searching in terms of yielding the highest recognition accuracy and robustness. In the second trial, the generation capability of the classifier was also validated by using the dataset collected from six new subjects. The average classification rates of 95{\%} and 93{\%} are obtained in trials 1 and 2, respectively. The results in trial 2 show the system is also good at classifying activity signals of new subjects. It can be concluded that the collective effects of the usage of single accelerometer sensing, the setting of the accelerometer placement and efficient classifier would make this wearable sensing system more realistic and more comfortable to be implemented for long-term human activity monitoring and classification in ambulatory environment, therefore, more acceptable by users.",

abstract="Assessing facial dynamics in patients with major neurocognitive disorders and specifically with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown to be highly challenging. Classically such assessment is performed by clinical staff, evaluating verbal and non-verbal language of AD-patients, since they have lost a substantial amount of their cognitive capacity, and hence communication ability. In addition, patients need to communicate important messages, such as discomfort or pain. Automated methods would support the current healthcare system by allowing for telemedicine, i.e., lesser costly and logistically inconvenient examination. In this work we compare methods for assessing facial dynamics such as talking, singing, neutral and smiling in AD-patients, captured during music mnemotherapy sessions. Specifically, we compare 3D ConvNets, Very Deep Neural Network based Two-Stream ConvNets, as well as Improved Dense Trajectories. We have adapted these methods from prominent action recognition methods and our promising results suggest that the methods generalize well to the context of facial dynamics. The Two-Stream ConvNets in combination with ResNet-152 obtains the best performance on our dataset, capturing well even minor facial dynamics and has thus sparked high interest in the medical community.",

Especially in online settings in which information about others is limited, the words employed play an important role in assessing an interlocutor's trustworthiness. Therefore, based on ability, benevolence, and integrity as the components of trustworthiness, we investigated word usage in three exemplary digitalized settings. The first scenario is a peer-to-peer discussion in online forums (e.g., when students need support in overcoming their procrastination). The second scenario is searching for online health advice (e.g., retrieving health information from other users with varying medical expertise). The third is online communication with spoken dialogue systems (e.g., asking Apple's® Siri® how to find one's way in an unknown town). Referring to the word usage in the respective communication setting, we address central language-related trust issues: (a) self-disclosure and the communication of empathy, (b) technical language and cues regarding the fragility of evidence, and (c) perceiving a shared view through lexical overlaps. The contribution ends with an outline of future research on the interplay between these three issues and trust.",

Nevertheless, the real starting point of QFD was in 1972 with the publication of an article by Mitsubishi Heavy Industry and Akao's first publication in the monthly magazine Standardization and Quality Control (1972). However, it was not until the first book about QFD edited by Mizuno and Akao (1978) was published that the application of QFD increased in Japan (see Table 9 for the main milestones in QFD's history). In 1975, the Japanese Society for Quality Control (JSQC) created the Computer Research Committee.29 This group dedicated the next 13 years to research on the method of QFD. Their final report in 1987 analysed the status of QFD applications in 80 companies in Japan (Akao and Mazur 2003, p. 22).",

abstract="Modern portable devices (e.g. wearables) provide technical support to record physical activity, which can assist various purposes, ranging from geolocation, step count, body temperature and biomedical parameters among others. These technological advances, the increase of literacy in health and also in informatics placed the smartphone and its massive use in the center of a new paradigm of monitoring physical activity. When combining these functionalities with the ability to communicate with remote entities, then it is possible to expand the use of smartphones, not only to monitoring physical activity but also to promote widespread adherence to physical activity programs. This paper presents the conceptual framework of a global health community program centered on a mobile application and a dedicated backoffice web application to perform physical activity prescription and supervision based on dashboards. The MOVIDA platform is comprised of 4 main modules, targeting different groups of the population. This platform enables exercise prescription, monitoring of user's performance and adherence in metabolic diseases patients by MOVIDA.cronos, to specify and follow a cardiac rehabilitation program by MOVIDA.eros, to track and quantify indoor movements by MOVIDA.domus, and also access to a stratified training circuit, for maintaining or improve fitness level by MOVIDA.polis. In addition, this work reports the project main challenges from the conceptual phase of the technological platform to its development and implementation. This work can be useful for those who are starting a project with the same type of characteristics: multicentric, interdisciplinary and involving several partners in the community.",

With the goal of assessing user behavior response (compliance) in persuasive systems, we propose a specific definition of situation along with a framework for designing situation recognition algorithms.",

abstract="This paper proposes a way in which cognitive models can be exploited in practical applications in the context of Ambient Intelligence. A computational model is introduced in which a cognitive model that addresses some aspects of human functioning is taken as a point of departure. From this cognitive model relationships between cognitive states and behavioural aspects affected by these states are determined. Moreover, representation relations for cognitive states are derived, relating them to external events such as stimuli that can be monitored. Furthermore, by automatic verification of the representation relations on monitoring information the occurrence of cognitive states affecting the human behaviour is determined. In this way the computational model is able to analyse causes of behaviour.",

Wearable health-monitoring systems (WHMSs) can provide real-time medical condition monitoring using multiple biosensors attached to the human body. In this paper, virtual multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is proposed as a suitable technique for biosensor networks as it enables higher throughput capacity and less energy consumption than conventional schemes.

In this paper, a description logic-based ontology in Web Ontology Language for HL7-RIM is proposed. This proposed ontology is used to instantiate medical records written in HL7, and also has been used to reason a sample medical rule.

abstract="From few years, interest in wireless sensor networks has been in potential use for many applications like border security surveillance, disaster management, field of health and objection detection in remote areas. Sensors are deployed in wide area to operate autonomously for long time in unattended environment. Sensors are equipped with low memory and limited battery power. The main job of wireless sensor nodes is to sense, gather and transmit the data to the center location. This requires the efficient routing paths to be set up between the sink and the sensor nodes which can be satisfied by various routing protocols. Industrialists, Individuals, researchers and students are trying to develop the efficient routing protocols in terms of various quality of service metrics. To develop the routing protocols it is necessary to understand the basics of WSN. In this chapter, we have given the brief overview of fundamentals of WSN, a deep insight into comparative study of various multi-hop routing protocols with future scope.",

And it is often acquired by sensitive mattress or chair without any constraints and limitations, but it contains many noise because of the impact of body and acquired equipment, those questions make heart rate detection difficult from the original BCG. In the paper, we propose an adaptive method which is used to extract heartbeat intervals (RR), and the method acquire automatically input parameters of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm, and then decompose BCG signal using EEMD algorithm, and select adaptively decomposition component of BCG signal, whose periodicity is in accordance with the cardiac cycle completely as the target signal. Furthermore we detect the peak points and calculate the heartbeat intervals series using the target signal. In the result, the proposed method is tested using the BCG datasets from 18 subjects, including 8 females and 10 males (age 20--72). Finally, the heart rate from BCG will be compared with ECG, and the results are satisfactory and have a high accuracy.",

In this article, we present a new study to adapt the grasping and the usage of an object designed by the user.

abstract="Sensor-based human activity recognition aims to automatically identify human activities from a series of sensor observations, which is a crucial task for supporting wide range applications. Typically, given sufficient training examples for all activities (or activity classes), supervised learning techniques have been applied to build a classification model using sufficient training samples for differentiating various activities. However, it is often impractical to manually label large amounts of training data for each individual activities. As such, semi-supervised learning techniques sound promising alternatives as they have been designed to utilize a small training set L, enhanced by a large unlabeled set U. However, we observe that directly applying semi-supervised learning techniques may not produce accurate classification. In this paper, we have designed a novel dynamic temporalextension technique to extend L into a bigger training set, and then build a final semi-supervised learning model for more accurate classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed technique outperforms existing 7 state-of-the-art supervised learning and semi-supervised learning techniques.",

abstract="The rich sensing ability of smart mobile phones brings an unique opportunity to detect and long-term monitor people's physical activities. However, with mobile phone the application has to comply with people's usage habit of it and thus capture the right moment to recognize activities, which will potentially cause great in-class variances. As a result, the model potentially becomes complex and costs much computing resources in mobile phone. This paper recognize people's physical activities when they place the mobile phone in the pockets near the pelvic region. Experiment results show that the accuracy could reach 97.7{\%}. To reduce the model size, evaluation of each feature attribution contribution for the accuracy is performed. And the result shows that we can cut the feature dimension from 22 to 8 while obtaining the smallest model.",

abstract="Recently, wireless sensor networks have been proposed for assisted living and residential monitoring. In such networks, physiological sensors are used to monitor vital signs e.g. heartbeats, pulse rates, oxygen saturation of senior citizens. Sensor data is sent periodically via wireless links to a personal computer that analyzes the data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection scheme based on time series analysis that will allow the computer to determine whether a stream of real-time sensor data contains any abnormal heartbeats. If anomaly exists, that time series segment will be transmitted via the network to a physician so that he/she can further diagnose the problem and take appropriate actions. When tested against the heartbeat data readings stored at the MIT database, our ECG anomaly scheme is shown to have better performance than another scheme that has been recently proposed. Our scheme enjoys an accuracy rate that varies from 70-90{\%} while the other scheme has an accuracy that varies from 40-70{\%}.",

Particularly, the use of user generated content, i.e., digital works in which data from one or more sources is combined and presented in innovative ways, is a great way to expose this value. Although there are many approaches to publishing and using consumer data, we believe Linked Data is a key solution of many of the challenges and can lower the cost and complexity of developing these applications.

Indeed, in the recent years, the scientific community devoted particular attention to detecting human falls, since the first cause of death for elderly people is due to the consequences of a fall. In this paper, we propose a human fall classification system based on an innovative floor acoustic sensor able to capture the acoustic waves transmitted through the floor. The algorithm employed is able to discriminate human falls from non falls and it is based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and a two class Support Vector Machine. The dataset employed for performance evaluation is composed by falls of a human mimicking doll, everyday objects and everyday noises. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is suitable for human fall detection in realistic scenarios, allowing to guarantee a 0{\%} miss probability at very low false positive rates.",

It describes the design, development and integration of the framework architecture as well as a Baxter robot based demonstration platform. Three key elements of the proposed framework (rehabilitation module, workspace and rehabilitation scenarios) have been described in detail. In the rehabilitation sessions, the users and the robot are asked to work together to place cubes so as to form a predefined shape. The robot and the user hold the same object in order to move it to a particular destination according to a rehabilitation scenario. If the robot detects a force from the user directed in the wrong direction during the navigation then it resists and corrects the movement in order to assist the user towards the right direction. The assistive support scenarios were designed to evaluate the achieved enhancement of precision, efficiency and dexterity of arm movements. The proposed rehabilitation framework provides a modular, automated and open-source platform for researchers and practitioners in neuromuscular rehabilitation applications.",

abstract="With the rapid development of wearable sensor technology, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on sensor data has attracted more and more attentions. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with perfect performance in speech recognition has a good effect on HAR. However, almost all these techniques train multiple Hidden Markov Models for different classes of activity. For a given activity sequence with multiple activities, the activity corresponding to the HMM with the maximum generating probability is selected as the recognition result, which is not suitable for continuous HAR with multiple activities. For this problem, we propose an improved Hidden Markov activity recognition algorithm where discriminative model and generative model are utilized. The discriminative model SVM is used to produce the observation sequence of HMM, and the generative model HMM is used to generate the final result. Compared with the traditional Hidden Markov HAR model, our proposal has good performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 score.",

This chapter describes how the received signal strength (RSS) measurements collected by a network of static radio transceivers can be used to localize people without requiring them to wear or carry any radio device. We describe a technique named radio tomographic imaging (RTI), which produces real-time images of the change in the radio propagation field of the monitored area caused by the presence of people. People's locations are inferred from the estimated RTI images. We show results from a long-term deployment in a typical single floor, one bedroom apartment. In order to deal with the dynamic nature of the domestic environment, we introduce methods to make the RTI system self-calibrating.

abstract="The natural and built environment has an impact on the amount of daily physical activity that people do, being less than the minimum recommended by international organizations. However, some characteristics of the environment may incentive physical activity more than others. While technological advances in geospatial information can be regarded as powerful enablers to identify and analyse these main features of the built environment, there is still a large gap between health-related professionals and the proper use of such technologies to address the prevalence of physical inactivity. This paper presents the research plan being conducted for a doctoral thesis with two major objectives: to identify a Playability Index that gives insights about how friendly is a city from the perspective of physical activity, and to develop a technological framework that eases the development of software-driven, effective interventions for promoting physical activity for young people in urban areas.",

abstract="Growing world population and rapid urbanization have increased the demand for mobility. The need for development of transportation technologies and infrastructural systems aimed at satisfying this increased demand is now non-negligible. As the number of private cars has increased after Industrial Revolution in spite of the unsufficient infrastructural capacity, the traffic problems are being confronted nowadays. As a solution to these problems, new roads are being built based on the ``predict and provide'' method which is part of today's traditional approach to transportation. However, it was found that new roads revive the stagnant demand, which even further complicate the traffic problem. In this context, it is believed that any solution focusing only on increasing the capacity and mobility in order to address the transportation problems will not be neither economical nor permanent. With this understanding in mind, traditional transportation approaches are replaced with sustainable transportation approaches with a trend initiated especially by the developed countries. The purpose of the sustainable transportation approach is to make investments into systems which place importance on accessibility; develop healthy, safe, equalitarian, comfortable and environmentally-friendly vehicle and infrastructure technologies; integrate transportation modes; which properly manage infrastructural capacity, passenger demands and operational supply; and relocate freight transportation to logistics centers. This study presents the historical development of sustainable transportation approaches and explores its principles in terms of environment, society and economy with award-winning exemplary projects, and offers recommendations for solutions to current problems of transportation in Turkey.",

abstract="Increasingly more companies support their strategies and value propositions offering their clients some services that require physical mobility and teamwork by their staff. This article proposes a type of Location-based Services system called Geomanagement, which supports the fulfilment of business strategy for a real estate broker agency, based on mobility and collaborative work of their employees. Geomanagement application acts as a valuable support to explore real estate and potential client information in each showing appointment, to share information among realtors and to help new and old realtors in developing teamwork skills while they are in movement. Clients also value the great contribution of Geomanagement regarding the collaboration between realtors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Geomanagement by generating value in, an uncommon scenario, as is a real state broker agency. We show that the implementation of Geomanagement increases both collaboration among realtors, and strategic control of managers and heads. Strengthening the link between collaboration and management control systems supported by Geomanagement, turned out to be crucial in business strategy follow-up and monitoring.",

In this context, clear understanding of buildings energy performances achieves primary importance and the inclusion of new variables in the analysis such as the user behavior can offer some insights into the solution of the discrepancy between predicted and real energy performances.

abstract="Infrastructures, effect of development strategies, have always represented an opportunity to rewrite society. The subject has been highly controversial since the 60s'. Nowadays, it is at the core of the cultural debate centered on sustainable development, around which research is connecting the concepts of city livability, resource-efficient mobility, sustainable urban society. The problem of urban congestion amplifies the issue of suburban disintegration, with the needs, uses and purposes of the city and of its inhabitants being more and more neglected. With reference to a sustainable territory transformation, the challenge of the research is double: on one hand, it aims at elaborating hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the possible scenarios of urban alternative mobility---ought to become more efficient; on the other hand, it seeks to integrate mobility systems with the project of territorial interchanges, grouping the population together into poles, linked by environmentally-friendly collective transports. The scenarios offered within the open field of urban phenomenology intend to create ideal social and environmental conditions, to optimize the way urban spaces are used and to create a mobility system able to guarantee an accessible and safe urban environment.",

In our system, physiological and kinetic data are collected in terms of sEMG, ECG, and acceleration signals. The necessary features are then extracted from the signals and integrated with self-rating method to train a neuro-fuzzy classifier. Finally, four degrees of this fatigue status can be distinguished by our system; this can provide further fatigue prediction and alertness in case of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) caused by underlying fatigue.",

Previous fusion engine designs had many weaknesses, among them their being specialized on a specific domain of application. The proposed architecture addresses such weakness and provides additional features, namely its ability to handle large number of modalities and due to its using knowledge base and standardization characteristics; it becomes suitable to various types of multimodal systems. The techniques used to achieve these features are discussed in this paper.",
