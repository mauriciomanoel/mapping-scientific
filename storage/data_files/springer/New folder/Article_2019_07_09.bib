abstract="Software Defined Networks (SDN) has been attracting researchers, scientist, and technology experts from both academia and industry to enhance the current ICT stakes and networking paradigm. The beauty of SDN is the division of Control and Data planes and make it easy for the engineers to modify the networking protocols without visiting onsite devices. Similarly, smart cities concept has been coined recently, where a plethora of smart devices will be connected and providing tons of services to the citizens, officials, and governmental departments. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in guaranteeing such services. Few efforts have been made to merge SDN and IoT with the sole purpose of efficient Data retrieval and achieve remotely configurable networks. In this paper, we explicitly define the Internet of Software Defined Things architecture and bring it to Smart Cities as a use-case. Our 3-tier architecture consists of Data Collection, Data Management, and Application levels that are further connected via two intermediate levels working on SDN principles. Followed by the potentials of SDN and IoT for Smart Cities, we evaluated our proposed architecture using Spark and GraphX with Hadoop Ecosystem and the results shows that efficient transfer of Data over SDN for real-time processing is achieved.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) devices and technologies for smart city applications produces a vast amount of multimedia data (e.g., audio, video, image, text and sensorial data), such big data are difficult to handle with traditional techniques and algorithms. The emerging machine learning techniques have the potential to facilitate the development of a new class of applications that can deal with such multimedia big data. Recently, Activity Recognition systems suggest using of multimedia data to detect daily actions, since it provides more accurate patterns; prevent the arising complain on privacy issues (in case of using audio-base data) and able to work on a big data. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) methodology for classifying audio data that is based on multilayer perceptron neural networks. The contributions of our work are to propose an efficient design of the network topology including hidden layers, neurons, and the fitness function. In addition, the proposed methodology contributed in producing high performance classifier in terms of accuracy and f-measure. The experiments have been conducted on four large audio-datasets that have been collected to represent different modalities in a smart city. The results indicated that the proposed methodology achieved high performance as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly deployed in different domains and environments including smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, industry 4.0, and smart agriculture, by connecting a large number of physical objects to deliver a new class of applications. The rising number of these connected objects and their heterogeneity have raised new research directions and challenges regarding their communications, scalability and the large amount of data that generate. As a result, new communication technologies have been proposed to be applied in these environments and applications, mainly to consider their main inherent properties which are the information that generate and handle, and the content that disseminate. Among the adopted techniques and recently integrated into the IoT is the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm. The choice of integration of ICN in the context of IoT is mainly motivated by all the advantages it represents, in particular content caching and decoupling senders and receivers. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the motivations behind using ICN in IoT environments and a survey of existing research work that have already applied ICN as a communication support for IoT applications.",

abstract="With the rapid increase in urbanisation, the concept of smart cities has attracted considerable attention. By leveraging emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and cloud computing, smart cities have the potential to improve various indicators of residents' quality of life. However, threats to data integrity may affect the delivery of such benefits, especially in the IoT environment where most devices are inherently dynamic and have limited resources. Prior work has focused on ensuring integrity of data in a piecemeal manner and covering only some parts of the smart city ecosystem. In this paper, we address integrity of data from an end-to-end perspective, i.e., from the data source to the data consumer. We propose a holistic framework for ensuring integrity of data in smart cities that covers the entire data lifecycle. Our framework is founded on three fundamental concepts, namely, secret sharing, fog computing and blockchain. We provide a detailed description of various components of the framework and also utilize smart healthcare as use case.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem that integrates physical objects, software and hardware to interact with each other. Aging of population, shortage of healthcare resources, and rising medical costs make IoT-based technologies necessary to be tailored to address these challenges in healthcare. This systematic literature review has been conducted to determine the main application area of IoT in healthcare, components of IoT architecture in healthcare, most important technologies in IoT, characteristics of cloud-based architecture, security and interoperability issues in IoT architecture and effects, and challenges of IoT in healthcare. Sixty relevant papers, published between 2000 and 2016, were reviewed and analyzed. This analysis revealed that home healthcare service was one of the main application areas of IoT in healthcare. Cloud-based architecture, by providing great flexibility and scalability, has been deployed in most of the reviewed studies. Communication technologies including wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, radio-frequency identification (RFID), ZigBee, and Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPAN) were frequently used in different IoT models. The studies regarding the security and interoperability issues in IoT architecture in health are still low in number. With respect to the most important effects of IoT in healthcare, these included ability of information exchange, decreasing stay of hospitalization and healthcare costs. The main challenges of IoT in healthcare were security and privacy issues.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) has been a noteworthy zone of research for empowering interconnection and joining the physical world through the Internet. At the beginning, it was used for single things but later advancements in different computing devices resulted in a new terminology called the internet of computing (IoC). In this paper, we review the latest progresses on IoT with IoC from a class review of published articles from 2009 to 2017. The review is classified alongside with (1) identification of users who are already in existence, (2) devices connected via various communication modes, (3) deterministic communication in IoT. The reviewed approaches are named as empirical, computing, innovative application and implementation approaches. The review shows that data stored in the cloud need to be mapped with geographic information system in order to fit with IoT and IoC. For IoT versus traditional communication approaches, it is found that reliable connection is one of the most emerging issues nowadays. It has been concluded that for the social consensus, IoC and IoT cooperating together are truly beneficial for upcoming years rather than just devices equipped with many sensor technologies. We hope to draw attention to this new topic with trends in the forthcoming era.",

Frailty of old age, susceptibility to diseases, and impairments are inevitable issues that these senior adults need to deal with in daily life. Recently, there has been an increasing demand on developing elderly care services utilizing novel technologies, with the aim of providing independent living. Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring. We investigate the existing approaches by considering the elderly requirements at the center of the attention. In addition, we evaluate the main objectives and trends in IoT-based elderly monitoring systems in order to pave the way for future systems to improve the quality of elderly's life.",

abstract="In this research, we propose virtual caregiver (VCareGiver), a virtual caregiver as a cyber-physical smart home (CPSH) companion to support the daily life activities of elderly people through their gestures. The CPSH will act as a virtual caregiver who will understand the need of an elderly person and be present with him/her ubiquitously at any time and at any location within his/her house. VCareGiver will help in solving two important problems. Firstly, a large population is at their old age who needs help in their daily chores, since the family members are unable to give full support (e.g. reminding the to-do list, maintaining appointments, taking medicine on right time, sending SMS, saving energy due to consumption of electricity, controlling home appliances, etc.) due to busy schedule. Secondly, due to the old age movement problem, they need support in doing activities through gesture. In this research, we want to test the viability of the virtual caregiver as a physical assistant. The gestures of an elderly subject in the physical world are recognized by a multi-sensory IoT-based framework that is passed to the CPSH, which analyses the gestures and generates a command to perform certain physical world activity and finally produce the visualization. A proof of concept CPSH has been implemented through the web, and smartphone based applications. More than 100 different gestures have been incorporated into the CPSH system through which different daily life activities can be performed. Initial test results are very encouraging and show the prospect of such virtual caregiver, which can revolutionize the quality of life of our prospective elderly generation.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified in various applications across different domains, such as in the healthcare sector. IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}7/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users' entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}17/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}12/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications. In the third category, 10.44{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}7/67) includes articles about security schemes. In the fourth category, 17.91{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}12/67) comprises security examination. In the fifth category, 13.43{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}9/67) analyses security protocols. In the final category, 14.92{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}10/67) analyses the security framework. Then, the identified basic characteristics of this emerging field are presented and provided in the following aspects. Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher's interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT. A map matching for both taxonomies is developed in this study to determine the novel risks and benefits of IoT-based smart home security for real-time remote health monitoring within client and server sides in telemedicine applications.",

In this paper, to promote the coverage performance of UAV-aided IoT communications, we maximize the minimum average rate of the IoT devices by jointly optimizing the resource allocation strategy and the UAV altitude. Particularly, to depict the practical propagation environment, we take the composite channel model including both the small-scale and the large-scale channel fading into account. Due to the difficulty in acquiring the random small-scale channel fading, we assume that only the large-scale channel sate information is available. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem, which is not convex and challenging to solve. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed using block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization tools. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the significant performance gain of the proposed scheme over existing ones.",

The system unifies the data- and knowledge-driven techniques to enable a real-time multi-level activity monitoring in a personalized smart home. The core components consist of a novel shared-structure dictionary learning approach combined with rule-based reasoning for continuous daily activity tracking and abnormal activities detection. WITS also exploits an Internet of Things middleware for the scalable and seamless management and learning of the information produced by ambient sensors. We further develop a user-friendly interface, which runs on both iOS and Andriod, as well as in Chrome, for the efficient customization of WITS monitoring services without programming efforts. This paper presents the architectural design of WITS, the core algorithms, along with our solutions to the technical challenges in the system implementation.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) technologies are advancing rapidly and a wide range of physical networking alternatives, communication standards and platforms are introduced. However, due to differences in system requirements and resource constraints in devices, there exist variations in these technologies, standards, and platforms. Consequently, application silos are formed. In contrast to the freedom of choice attained by a range of options, the heterogeneity of the technologies is a critical interoperability challenge faced by IoT systems. Moreover, IoT is also limited to address new requirements that arise due to the nature of the majority of smart devices. These requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, are hardly satisfied by the current IoT technologies following the end-to-end model inherited from the Internet. This paper introduces a lightweight, distributed, and embedded service bus called LISA which follows a Node Centric Networking architecture. LISA is designed to provide interoperability for resource-constrained devices in IoT. It also enables a natural way of embracing the new IoT requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, through node centric networking. LISA provides a simple application programming interface for developers, hiding the variations in platform, protocol or physical network, thus facilitating interoperability in IoT systems. LISA is inspired by network on terminal architecture (NoTA), a service centric open architecture originated by Nokia Research Center. Our extensive experimental results show the efficiency and scalability of LISA in providing a lightweight interoperability for IoT systems.",

abstract="Smart devices are already present in all areas of knowledge: sometimes as the main role, and sometimes as the supporting role. Regardless of their function, smart devices communicate with other devices, monitor, and control everything in the physical world. In this way, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been gaining ramifications. The one that is growing most in the area of health, and that is becoming more and more popular, is IoHT. Several treatments have been employed around the world based around IoHT, including one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is one of four existing neuromotor diseases without a cure to date. With the progression of the disease, patients lose the strength of the body's voluntary muscles until total paralysis. Other consequences of the progression of the disease are the loss of autonomy in some aspects of life in addition to the loss of self-esteem. This work aims to develop a BCI system based on IoHT using a personal digital assistant brainwave sensor to assist patients with ALS in performing predefined tasks. To validate this tool as a complement to traditional medical treatment, ten volunteers conducted tests on the proposed solution. Results were very promising.",

abstract="Smart city applications and services are increasingly considered as strategic means to cope with emerging global challenges such as climate change, pollution, the ageing population, and energy shortage. In particular, smart parking is a type of smart services used to improve traffic congestion and pollution within cities. Nevertheless, although smart city services are driven by advanced information technologies, their success is highly dependent on user engagement, which is historically problematic. This paper presents and discusses the results of a case study on the smart parking service in London. A questionnaire (involved a total of 212 local drivers) was adopted as the main data collection method. This was complemented by the collection and analysis of 470 online user comments left for the service. The results showed that London's smart parking service may potentially help each driver to save an average of {\textsterling}68 (62.2 l) on petrol annually and reduce CO2 emissions by 238.14 kg per car per year. At city level, a smart parking system could help London save {\textsterling}183.6 million worth of petrol per year and reduce its annual CO2 emissions by 642,978 tons. However, public awareness, actual usage, and user satisfaction of this smart service are currently very low. These present substantial barriers to realise the potential economic and environmental benefits of the service. This paper concluded that further to the very technological efforts, local authorities and service providers need to make a stronger endeavour to enhance public engagement and user satisfaction towards smart services, in order to realise the promises of such solutions.",

abstract="Good governance is necessary to make cities resilient and sustainable. To achieve this, we propose the Responsive City, in which citizens, enabled by technology, take on an active role in urban planning processes. Adequate planning of Responsive Cities requires a change and evolvement of the role of policy-makers, government experts, urban planners, and architects. A key factor is hereby the understanding of urban dynamics. In this paper we present a method to model the dynamics of the city from the viewpoint of the urban metabolism as a system of stocks and flows. Understanding these flows helps to identify the main characteristics of the city and advances the knowledge of relationships between different stocks and flows in the system. Big Data can inform and support this process with evidence by taking advantage of behavioural data from infrastructure sensors and crowdsourcing initiatives. They can be overlaid with spatial information in order to respond to events in decreasing time spans by automating the response process partially, which is a necessity for any resilient city management.

abstract="Over the past century, in most countries, there has been a continual increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine. However, these improvements are now coupled with aging population demographics and falling birth rates, which, when combined, are expected to significantly burden the socioeconomic well-being of many of these countries. In fact, never before in human history have we been confronted with such a large aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions for the well-being, healthcare and social needs of the elderly. One efficient and cost-effective solution to the problem of elderly/patient care is remote healthcare monitoring so they can continue to live at home rather than in nursing homes or hospitals that are very expensive and with limited spaces. These remote monitoring systems will allow medical personnel to keep track of important physiological signs with reduced human resources, at less cost and in real time. This paper introduces several low-cost, noninvasive, user-friendly sensing and actuating systems using information and communication technologies. Such systems can be used to create engineering solutions to some of the pressing healthcare problems in our society, especially as it pertains to the elderly. One example is the integration of sensors, wireless communications, low-power electronics and intelligent computing to determine health-related information using signals from walking patterns. Such a sensing system will be suitable for prolonged use in a home environment. It will be wearable, noninvasive and non-intrusive, similar to smart socks, smart wrist-bands or smart belts. Other examples such as a smart joint monitor and a smart sleeping environment will be discussed, and future perspectives and research challenges in smart home technologies will be described.",

abstract="With a growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the businesses are undergoing a revolution in the way they monitor and control. In the recent past, many applications were developed using the IoT system architectures in various business verticals such as industrial, healthcare, farming, transportation, etc. However, with the development of low-complex artificial intelligence frameworks which are capable of operating on the edge devices, the IoT architectures have taken a major leap leading to the Internet of Intelligent Things (IoIT). In this paper, we discuss our focused research and applications of IoIT across the following verticals: (1) healthcare, (2) smart buildings, (3) farming, along with the recent state of the art methodologies and future challenges. Under the healthcare, we laid our main focus on the development of AI enabled computer-aided diagnosis framework, which acquires the scanning information from a wireless ultrasound transducer and automatically identifies the abnormalities present. Also, we developed a low-complex brain-controlled IoT environments framework which automatically classifies the motor imagery task performed by the user using 22 channel electroencephalography. Using IoIT, we developed a novel non-invasive technology capable of monitoring various electrical parameters without any need for cutting the wires. This developed non-invasive power monitor is capable of generating real-time alerts in the case of system malfunctions and will be a key enabler for smart buildings. Also, we developed mathematical, simulation, and experimental models for analyzing the performance of channel access mechanisms of dense traffic IoT networks.",

abstract="Recent changes in service environments have changed the preconditions of their production and consumption. These changes include unbundling services from production processes, growth of the information-rich economy and society, the search for creativity in service production and consumption and continuing growth of digital technologies. These contextual changes affect city governments because they provide a range of infrastructure and welfare services to citizens. Concepts such as `smart city', `intelligent city' and `knowledge city' build new horizons for cities in undertaking their challenging service functions in an increasingly cost-conscious, competitive and environmentally oriented setting. What is essential in practically all of them is that they paint a picture of cities with smooth information processes, facilitation of creativity and innovativeness, and smart and sustainable solutions promoted through service platforms. This article discusses this topic, starting from the nature of services and the new service economy as the context of smart local public services. On this basis, we build an overall framework for understanding the basic forms and dimensions of smart public services. The focus is on conceptual systematisation of the key dimensions of smart services and the conceptual modelling of smart service platforms through which digital technology is increasingly embedded in social creativity. We provide examples of real-life smart service applications within the European context.",

abstract="Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) is the fast growing network of interconnected things that collect and exchange data using embedded sensors planted everywhere. It is an interconnection of several things through a diverse communication system capable of monitoring, collecting, exchanging, analysing, and delivering valuable and challenging amount of information. Given their ability to be operated autonomously, their high mobility, and their communication and processing power, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be involved in numerous IIoT-related applications, where multimedia and video streaming plays a key role. Our main interest is the multimedia routing in IIoT and its facilities during and/or after operational hours. For recovering, constructing and selecting k-disjoint paths, capable of putting up with failure of the parameters but satisfying the quality of service, we introduce an industry-oriented Canonical Particle Swarm (CPS) optimization data delivery framework. During communication with the UAV, multi-swarm strategy is used to determine the optimal direction while performing a multipath routing. Authenticity of the proposed approach has been tested and results show that, compared to the ordinary Canonical Particle Multi-path Swarm (CPMS) optimization and Fully Multi-path Particle Swarm (FMPS) optimization, the proposed method is better.",

abstract="In the present society, most families are double-income families, and as the long-term care is seriously short of manpower, it contributes to the rapid development of tele-homecare equipment, and the smart home care system gradually emerges, which assists the elderly or patients with chronic diseases in daily life. This study aims at interaction between persons under care and the system in various living spaces, as based on motion-sensing interaction, and the context-aware smart home care system is proposed. The system stores the required contexts in knowledge ontology, including the physiological information and environmental information of the person under care, as the database of decision. The motion-sensing device enables the person under care to interact with the system through gestures. By the inference mechanism of fuzzy theory, the system can offer advice and rapidly execute service, thus, implementing the EHA. In addition, the system is integrated with the functions of smart phone, tablet PC, and PC, in order that users can implement remote operation and share information regarding the person under care. The health care system constructed in this study enables the decision making system to probe into the health risk of each person under care; then, from the view of preventive medicine, and through a composing system and simulation experimentation, tracks the physiological trend of the person under care, and provides early warning service, thus, promoting smart home care.",

abstract="The rapidly ageing population is placing increasing strain on healthcare services. Robots have been proposed as a way to assist people to stay healthy and safe in their own homes. However, despite the need for such assistive devices and the success of some healthcare robots, other robots have had a poor response. This article reviews the literature about human responses to healthcare robots and summarises the variables that have been found to influence responses. It may be possible to increase acceptance of healthcare robots by properly assessing the needs of the human user and then matching the robot's role, appearance and behaviour to these needs. Because robots have limitations in their abilities, another way to increase acceptance may be to modify the expectations of users to better match robots' abilities. More research needs to investigate potential users' needs and expectations in specific situations and whether interventions to increase the match between robot and human can increase acceptance.",

In particular, the robotic solutions are explored and critiqued and areas for future development identified. The literature was reviewed for factors that influence admission to nursing home care, and for technological solutions to these factors. The main issues facing older people are physical decline, cognitive decline, health management, and psychosocial issues. Robots exist that may meet some of the identified issues but gaps where robots could be developed include delivering interventions to prevent physical decline occurring and robots with multiple functions, including a range of cognitive stimuli and health education. To reduce barriers to acceptance, robots designed to provide physical and healthcare assistance should have a serious appearance. On the other hand animal-like robots can address psychosocial issues and function like pets. While smart phones and computers can offer some solutions, robots may promote adherence due to a social presence. Robots are being developed to address areas of need in older people, including physical, cognitive, medical and psychosocial issues. However more focus could be placed on developing preventative interventions, multifunctional robots, greater educational content and motivational aspects of appearance and interaction style.",

abstract="Home networks currently dominated by human--object or human--human information production, exchange, processing, and paradigms are transitioning to machine to machine (M2M) due to the sudden introduction of embedded devices. Recently, due to the spread of IT equipment, more M2M-related devices are being used, and M2M-based projects are underway in various fields such as M2M-based u-city, u-port, u-work, u-traffic, etc. M2M has been applied in various fields, and u-healthcare is attracting attention in the M2M medical field. U-healthcare refers to technology in which ordinary patients can receive prescription services from experts by continuously monitoring changes in their health status during daily life at home based on wired and wireless communications infrastructures. In this paper, we propose an M2M-based smart health service for human UI/UX using motion recognition. Non-IP protocol, not TCP/IP protocol, has been used in sensor networks applied to M2M-based u-healthcare. However, sensors should be connected to the Internet in order to expand the use of services and facilitate management of the M2M-based sensor network. Therefore, we designed an M2M-based smart health service considering network mobility since data measured by the sensors should be transferred over the Internet. Unlike existing healthcare platforms, M2M-based smart health services have been developed for motion recognition as well as bio-information. Smart health services for motion recognition can sense four kinds of emotions, anger, sadness, neutrality, and joy, as well as stress using sensors. Further, they can measure the state of the individual by recognizing a user's respiratory and heart rates using an ECG sensor. In the existing medical environment, most medical information systems managing patient data use a centralized server structure. Using a fixed network, it is easy to collect and process limited data, but there are limits to processing a large amount of data collected from M2M devices in real-time. Generally, M2M communication used in u-healthcare consists of many networked devices and gateways. An M2M network may use standardized wireless technology based on the requirements of a particular device. Network mobility occurs when the connecting point changes according to the movement of any network, and the terminal can be connected without changing its address. If the terminal within the network communicates with any corresponding node, communication between the terminal and corresponding node should be continuously serviced without discontinuation. The method proposed in this paper can easily respond to dynamic changes in the wireless environment and conduct systematic management based on user's motion recognition using technology to support mobility among sensor nodes in M2M.",

abstract="A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from the earth's natural forces. We can now take advantage of information technology (IT) devices to make migration decisions and hazard analysis. The range of IT applications is very wide, and could include robot manufacturing, remote exploration, fuzzy Lyapunov techniques, artificial intelligence, intelligent devices, tension leg platform design, consumer and service quality, and management information systems. Management information systems are especially helpful to medical personnel when carrying out the treatment and medication of patients. Sometimes, though, hospital staff might not have immediate access to a patient's records such as response to treatments, medication status, or examination results because the computer equipment is not easily portable. In such situations, it is only possible to keep written records, with the data being cataloged or referred to only after returning to the nursing station or office. If the hospital could implement a computerized medical service cart for use in the wards, the above problems would be solved. These computers could use a wireless network system, linked with the central server to access information. The technology now exists and the era of the smart phone has now been entered. Smart phones/tablet PCs could be applied for clinical medical care. For the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, smart health devices designed for home care service are necessary and should be applied as soon as possible. This study designs a wireless physiology signal monitoring system that uses a smart phone with a wireless network apparatus to provide convenient monitoring for patients in the home care service system. The wireless care system is designed for patients who need long-term home care services or assistance with chronic diseases. This paper provides important suggestions to develop ways to connect patients to medical care institutions through the internet.",

abstract="Nowadays, tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is seen in smart environments such as medical remote care applications which are crucial due to the general aging of the population. With the recent advancements in IoT-based healthcare technologies, activity recognition can be used as the key part of the intelligent healthcare systems to monitor elderly people to live independently at homes and promote a better care. Recently, the evidence theory and its derivates approaches began to take place in the fields of activity recognition in these smart systems. However, these approaches are generally inconsistent with the probability calculus due to the lower and upper probability bounds considering the combined evidences. To overcome these challenges and to get more precisely the reconcilement between the evidence theory with the frequentist approach of probability calculus, this work proposes a new methodology for combining beliefs, addressing some of the disadvantages exhibited by the evidence theory and its derivatives. This methodology merges the non-normalized conjunctive and the majority rules. The proposed rule is evaluated in numerical simulation case studies involving the activity recognition in a smart home environment. The results show that this strategy produces intuitive results in favor of the more committed hypothesis.",

abstract="The reality of an ageing Europe has called attention to the importance of e-inclusion for a growing population of senior citizens. For some, this may mean closing the digital divide by providing access and support to technologies that increase citizen participation; for others, e-inclusion means access to assistive technologies to facilitate and extend their living independently. These initiatives address a social need and provide economic opportunities for European industry. While undoubtedly desirable, and supported by European Union initiatives, several cultural assumptions or issues related to the initiatives could benefit from fuller examination, as could their practical and ethical implications. This paper begins to consider these theoretical and practical concerns. The first part of the paper examines cultural issues and assumptions relevant to adopting e-technologies, and the ethical principles applied to them. These include (1) the persistence of ageism, even in e-inclusion; (2) different approaches to, and implications of independent living; and (3) the values associated with different ethical principles, given their implications for accountability to older users. The paper then discusses practical issues and ethical concerns that have been raised by the use of smart home and monitoring technologies with older persons. Understanding these assumptions and their implications will allow for more informed choices in promoting ethical application of e-solutions for older persons.",

abstract="Multimedia communication is revolutionizing all major spheres of human life. The advent of IoT and its applications in many fields like sensing, healthcare and industry, result exponential increase in multimedia data, that needs to be shared over insecure networks. IoT driven setups are however constrained in terms of resources as a result of their small size. From data security point of view a conventional algorithms cannot be used for data encryption on an IoT platform given the resource constraints. The work presented in this paper studies the performance of SIMON cryptographic algorithm and proposes a light-weight-cryptography algorithm based on SIMON for its possible use in an IoT driven setup. The focus is on speed enhancement benefitting from software prospective, making it different than common studies mostly reflecting hardware implementations. To achieve performance in practical prospective, the contribution looks into SIMON cipher's characteristics considering utilizing it for internet of things (IoT) healthcare applications. The paper suggests further improvement to implement the original SIMON cryptography in order to reduce the encryption time and maintain the practical trade-off between security and performance. The proposed work has been compared to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the original SIMON block cipher algorithms in terms of execution time, memory consumption. The results show that the proposed work is suitable for securing data in an IoT driven setup.",

In this paper, we propose a patient state recognition system for the healthcare framework. We design the system in such a way that it provides good recognition accuracy, provides low-cost modeling, and is scalable. The system takes two main types of input, video and audio, which are captured in a multi-sensory environment. Speech and video input are processed separately during feature extraction and modeling; these two input modalities are merged at score level, where the scores are obtained from the models of different patients' states. For the experiments, 100 people were recruited to mimic a patient's states of normal, pain, and tensed. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an average 98.2 {\%} recognition accuracy.",

abstract="This research explores the opportunity to use standards as recommender instruments for designing urban policy. Standards are soft regulatory mechanisms that can be used for monitoring and safeguarding. More precisely, we explore the potential use of social standards for centering the focus of the smart cities initiative back to the citizens, and establishing a citizen-centered approach. This is in contrast to the industrial drive and technological emphasis which currently dominates. Accordingly, we present a set of novel citizenship indicators which serve as the basis for the social standardization of smart cities, something which is not now taking place, in order to ensure and safeguard the basic social urban rights of citizens. The juridical basis and well-established points of reference for building indicators for citizens' rights in the city are two International Charters. These are the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City, and the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City. In this paper, we start by comparing and analyzing the rights contained in each of the two Charters, and elaborating indicators for measuring the promotion and protection of these rights. The elaboration of indicators has been based on different criteria and under the common premise of universal existence of feeding data, which is the most recurrent problem when building indicators meant to be global. Next, at the request of the International Standards Organization (ISO), we select the most relevant socio-cultural indicators for the Global Charter Agenda, which will be introduced in the on-going revision of the smart cities and communities standard ISO 37120:2014 Sustainable development of communities---Indicators for city services and quality of life. This will make ISO 37120 a more beneficial social standard for monitoring and safeguarding citizens' rights in the smart city.",

abstract="There is increased interest in deploying big data technology in the healthcare industry to manage massive collections of heterogeneous health datasets such as electronic health records and sensor data, which are increasing in volume and variety due to the commoditization of digital devices such as mobile phones and wireless sensors. The modern healthcare system requires an overhaul of traditional healthcare software/hardware paradigms, which are ill-equipped to cope with the volume and diversity of the modern health data and must be augmented with new ``big data'' computing and analysis capabilities. For researchers, there is an opportunity in healthcare data analytics to study this vast amount of data, find patterns and trends within data and provide a solution for improving healthcare, thereby reducing costs, democratizing health access, and saving valuable human lives. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of different big data analytics integrated healthcare systems and describe the various applicable healthcare data analytics algorithms, techniques, and tools that may be deployed in wireless, cloud, Internet of Things settings. Finally, the contribution is given in formation of a convergence point of all these platforms in form of SmartHealth that could result in contributing to unified standard learning healthcare system for future.",

abstract="In recent years, the number of elderly people living alone has grown rapidly. This increases the need for indoor healthcare services that help elderly residents live a safe and independent life. There has been increasing interest in indoor ubiquitous healthcare (U-Healthcare) applications that monitor the elderly unobtrusively via sensors and that warn them or healthcare providers of abnormal conditions. In U-Healthcare applications, automatically locating and tracking users who move around a building is a fundamental feature. Outdoor location sensing technologies such as the global positioning systems are not suitable for use in indoor environments, such as ``smart home'' applications, because their indoor-based location sensing lacks accuracy. This paper proposes an indoor U-Healthcare system that uses radio-frequency identification technology to accurately locate and track the elderly. The proposed system provides real-time monitoring of elderly people's whereabouts. In addition, it analyzes their locations in association with time slots and the length of time they stay in the same place, thus inferring information such as movement patterns, ranges, and frequencies. This information is used to determine elderly people's well-being and to warn family or healthcare workers of any potential problems. The proposed indoor U-Healthcare system improves the quality and convenience of care delivered to elderly people.",

abstract="According to the World Health Organization, most of the world population is affected by chronic diseases, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes while another dominant problem is of aging population. Thus, it is desirable to have cost effective solutions for health monitoring, especially for countries that have minimum conventionally trained healthcare staff and infrastructure. Healthcare has shifted from hospital dominant services to patient dominant services which has thrived WBANs to provide ubiquitous health monitoring by virtue of wearable or implantable sensor nodes that commonly monitor biological signals. As the society becomes more health conscious, WBANs have the potential to revolutionize the way people integrate their health and information technology. Hence, WBANs are desired to strengthen conventional healthcare systems. Notwithstanding the current achievements, technological advances, proposed solutions and commercialized products; WBANs still experience many obstacles in their foolproof adoption. This paper surveys the plethora of WBAN applications and network architecture in detail used for data collection, data transmission and data analysis that form sensor analyst system in the realm of Internet of Things. Wireless communicational technologies are also discussed in this paper. Also, we have categorized the routing protocols and have provided with their critical qualitative analysis. Towards the end we discuss several projects in the field of WBANs and some open research areas. These findings on how the sensor nodes, newest routing protocols and data analysis techniques influence ubiquitous health monitoring sets this survey apart from the already existing surveys on WBANs.",

abstract="A smart home is a home environment enriched with sensing, actuation, communication and computation capabilities which permits to adapt it to inhabitants preferences and requirements. Establishing a proper strategy of actuation on the home environment can require complex computational tasks on the sensed data. This is the case of activity recognition, which consists in retrieving high-level knowledge about what occurs in the home environment and about the behaviour of the inhabitants. The inherent complexity of this application domain asks for tools able to properly support the design and implementation phases. This paper proposes a framework for the design and implementation of smart home applications focused on activity recognition in home environments. The framework mainly relies on the Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE) architecture offering basic abstraction entities which easily allow to design and implement Smart Home applications. CASE is a three layered architecture which exploits the distributed multi-agent paradigm and the cloud technology for offering analytics services. Details about how to implement activity recognition onto the CASE architecture are supplied focusing on the low-level technological issues as well as the algorithms and the methodologies useful for the activity recognition. The effectiveness of the framework is shown through a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of a person in a home environment.",

abstract="Smart hospital is a healthcare infrastructure that uses IoT technology. This intelligent space allows to collaborate a several health actors via their IoT devices. This coordination improves the quality and continuity of health services for better patient care. However, uncontrolled access to patient information can disrupt the smooth running of hospital services. In this paper, we aim to secure the information of patient exchanged and shared, using the privacy and access control based on the context. We develop two protocols, the first is a context-aware pseudonym service. It protects the patient's personal and health information in two smart space hospital and home. Furthermore, we prevent the disclosure of the patient's location during his hospital stay. The second is an authorization and delegation protocol based on trust, context and role. It oversees the actions and interactions of health body with the smart bracelet object of patient. Our protocol uses the context to generate a set of roles with their trust values. Only one role is activated if its trust value is greater than or equal to a trust threshold. A dynamic delegation mechanism is created to better manage the interactions between health bodies. We demonstrate through the practical analysis as well as generation time overhead, storage overhead and response time requirement the efficiency and robustness of our proposed protocols.",

abstract="Recognizing human activities non-intrusively has prevailed as a challenging and active area of research. In real life, it is a major requirement for human-centric applications like assisted living for elderly care, health-care and creating a smart home environment etc. Considering that people spend more than 90{\%} (Klepeis et al. in J Exposure Sci Environ Epidemiol 11(3):231, 2001) of their time indoors, a proper indoor activity monitoring system will be helpful to monitor the abnormal behavior of the occupants. Existing approaches have implemented intrusive or invasive methods such as a camera or wearable devices. In this work, we present a non-invasive, non-intrusive sensing technique using an array of heterogeneous ultrasonic sensors for human activity monitoring. The ultrasonic sensors are placed in two separate deployments as sensor grids and in different positions of the door-frame. The proposed system senses a stream of events as the occupants perform different activities categorized as primary, postural and group activities. The primary activities considered are sitting, standing and fall. The postural activities are intermediate transitional states in the primary activities. These activities when performed in groups, are considered as a group activity. Other than activities it can identify different indoor movements, count room occupancy and identify occupants. Based on the collected data, the results show that the proposed system achieves an accuracy of more than 90{\%} for detection of different activities and shows improvement over existing works. The final outcome of this work can be seen as developing the current prototype into smart ceiling panels that can be easily used in the indoor environment for human activity monitoring.",

Various kinds of smart devices have been launched and applied in our daily lives to provide services for individuals; however, the existing computing frameworks including local silo-based and cloud-based architectures, are not quite fit for personal computing services. Meanwhile, personal computing applications exhibit special features, they are latency-sensitive, energy efficient, highly reliable, mobile, etc, which further indicates that a new computing architecture is urgently needed to support such services. Thanks to the emerging edge computing paradigm, we were inspired to apply the distributed cooperative computing idea at the data source, which perfectly solves issues occurring among existing computing paradigms while meeting the requirements of personal computing services. Therefore, we explore personal computing services utilizing the edge computing paradigm, discuss the overall edge-based system architecture for personal computing services, and design the conceptual framework for an edge-based personal computing system. We analyze the functionalities in detail. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a fall detection application is simulated in our preliminary evaluation as an example service in which three Support Vector Machine based fall detection algorithms with different kernel functions are implemented. Experimental results show edge computing architecture can improve the performance of the system in terms of total latency, with about 22.75{\%} reduction on average in the case of applying 4G at the second hop even when the data and computing stream of the application is small.",

abstract="The technology of Smart Homes (SH), as an instance of ambient assisted living technologies, is designed to assist the homes' residents accomplishing their daily-living activities and thus having a better quality of life while preserving their privacy. A SH system is usually equipped with a collection of inter-related software and hardware components to monitor the living space by capturing the behaviour of the resident and understanding his activities. By doing so the system can inform about risky situations and take actions on behalf of the resident to his satisfaction. The present survey will address technologies and analysis methods and bring examples of the state of the art research studies in order to provide background for the research community. In particular, the survey will expose infrastructure technologies such as sensors and communication platforms along with artificial intelligence techniques used for modeling and recognizing activities. A brief overview of approaches used to develop Human--Computer interfaces for SH systems is given. The survey also highlights the challenges and research trends in this area.",

abstract="New healthcare technologies are emerging with the increasing age of the society, where the development of smart homes for monitoring the elders' activities is in the center of them. Identifying the resident's activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12{\%} improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition, which used dynamic segmentation. The f-measure metric demonstrated up to 12.73{\%} improvement.",

abstract="With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, the security has been significantly called more and more people's attention on wireless communication between the devices and the human-beings, as well as the devices to devices. Smart home (SH), as a small-scale example of the smart application-based field, has benefited from the concept of IoT since it uses an indoor data-centric sensor network. In SH, routing schemes are widely utilized for data aggregation purposes. However, there are three main issues, which can considerably affect the current execution of routing protocol in SH: (1) lack of technical methods for precisely regional division of the network, (2) the difficulty of differentiating data among various functional regions, and (3) the vulnerability of network with advanced internal routing attacks. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, a two-layer cluster-based network model for indoor structured SH and a novel Beta-based trust management (BTM) scheme are proposed to defend various types of internal attacks by integrating the variation of trust value, threshold, and evaluation. The proposed structure forms a secure hierarchical routing protocol called SH-PCNBTM to effectively support the data transmission service in SH networks. The performance of SH-PCNBTM is thoroughly evaluated by using a set of comprehensive simulations. We will show that the proposed routing protocol not only ensures the even distribution of cluster-heads in each sub-region, but it also identifies and isolates the malicious sensor nodes accurately and rapidly compared with other trust-based hierarchical routing protocols.",

abstract="In modern society, the amount of information has significantly increased due to the development of BT-IT convergence technology. This leads to developing information obtaining and searching technologies from much data. Although system integration for medicare has been largely established to accumulate large amounts of information, there is a lack of provision and support of information for nursing activities, using such an established database. In particular, the judgment for pain intervention depends on the experience of individual nurses, leading to usually making subjective decisions. Thus, there is some danger in applying unwanted anesthesia and drug abuse. In this paper, we proposed the interactive pain nursing intervention system for smart health service. The proposed method uses collaborative filtering that extracts some pain strengths, which represent a high relative level, based on similar pain strengths. Pain strength estimation method using collaborative filtering calculates patient similarities through Pearson correlation coefficients in which a neighbor selection method is used based on the pain strength. In general, medical data in patients shows various distributions due to its own characteristics, as sample data demonstrates. Therefore, this is determined as an applicable theory to the sparsity problem. In addition, it is compensated using a default voting method. The medical data evaluated by applying standard data and its accuracy in pain prediction is verified. The test of the proposed method yielded excellent extraction results; it is possible to provide the fundamental data and guideline to nurses for recognizing the pain of patients based on the results of this study. This represents increased patient welfare for smart health services.",

abstract="One rapidly growing application of Internet of Things (IoT) is the protection of public health and well-being through enabling environmental monitoring services. In particular, an IoT-enabled health/accessibility monitoring service can be consulted by its users to query about the status of different areas so as to optimize their trip throughout a geographic region. Given the high cost associated with a vast deployment of totally trusted information sources, the IoT-enabled monitoring services also subsist on citizen engagement and on (possibly untrusted) users sensing apparatus for data collection. However, trust management becomes a key factor in the success of such services because they might be misled by malicious users through altered or fake sensor data. In this paper, we consider a monitoring service and propose a hybrid entity/data trust computation scheme which relies on Bayesian learning to score the users (as data reporters), and on Dempster--Shafer theory (DST) for data fusion and for the computation of the trustworthiness of the data itself. In order to provide resiliency against behavioral changes, the probability masses used in DST are dynamically updated using the freshly estimated user scores as well as the contextual properties associated with the reported data. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our scheme. Compared to prior work, the results demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy and resilience against malicious behavior.",

This study aimed to investigate employers' demand for re-employing older people, specifically in two major areas: 1) the current employers' behavior or experience as well as attitude towards older employees, and 2) what will stimulate the employment of older people. The data were gathered by face-to-face interviews employing a structured questionnaire from 301 owners of or the CEOs of business establishments in Khon Kaen Municipality (KKM), Thailand. These were selected from business establishments in KKM proportionally via a stratified sampling procedure, by business sector, legality classification and size. More than half of those businesses with older employees were pleased with them, larger manufacturing businesses retain most of the older employees, and no indication was found that these employers discharge their employees even if they reach official retirement age, nor do older employees stay with an organization for shorter periods of time than any other employees. Furthermore, we found no significant difference in level of satisfaction between the manufacturing sector and the commercial sector. Formal business operators (e.g. limited liability partnerships, limited companies, etc.) were more satisfied with their older employees rather than informal ones. Additionally, size of corporation was related to the level of satisfaction. Lastly, the most desired intervention measures were intermediary mechanisms to link potential employers closer to potential employees. Preferred choices of government incentives to boost the employment of older people, by both business sector are tax incentives and wage subsidies.",

To this end, an extensive search was conducted to find articles dealing with (a) telemedicine, (b) triage, (c) priority and (d) sensor; (e) comprehensively review related applications and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were checked for articles on triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the type of telemedicine technology explored. A total of 150 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category includes reviews and surveys of triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The second category includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. Tier 1 represents the users. Sensors acquire the vital signs of the users and send them to Tier 2, which is the personal gateway that uses local area network protocols or wireless body area network. Medical data are sent from Tier 2 to Tier 3, which is the healthcare provider in medical institutes. Then, the motivation for using triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine, the issues related to the obstruction of its application and the development and utilisation of telemedicine are examined on the basis of the findings presented in the literature.",

abstract="The product line engineering (PLE) has proven to be the paradigm for developing diversified products and systems in shorter time, at lower cost, and higher quality. Ultimately the goal of PLE is to evolve a set of products that have both commonality and variations built into them, which allows a high degree of variability between the different products. The current trend in smart home deployment---based on commissions---guarantees a complete satisfaction for each inhabitant, as designed per resident basis. To reduce high deployment cost and to resolve the non-reusability of the resources, the product line engineering methodology can be employed in selecting or configuring the appropriate smart home technology. Within the smart homes and ambient assisted living, not only do the reusable features reduce cost, they also do not compromise with the guarantee of complete satisfaction of each resident as few senior inhabitants may impose severe constraints on the binding of few common features. In our previous work (Sharma et al., 9th International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics (ICOST), 2011), we propose an approach called, wrenching that claims the best resident satisfaction at the reduced deployment cost. Today seniors are fast growing population globally (http://www.aoa.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main{\_}Site/Data/2008) and the increased demand for smart homes in the near future is undeniable. Thus to provide assistance and independence to each senior resident of a smart home, reduction in time to market (Wohlin and Ahlgren, Softw Qual J 4:189--205, 1995) of appropriate assistive smart home technology becomes an essential consideration. Long term analysis of variability binding can help to analyze that few variants are bound more often over others. Respecting the satisfaction guarantee, the highly demanded variants can be permanently migrated into commonality, advocating the reusability. The improved reusability of features (e.g., sensors) not only enhances economy of scale but also time to market. The migration of a feature from variability to commonality is known as realizing.",

abstract="As an interest in health and disease has increased, medical service has changed to prevention of disease and health care from treatment oriented service. Medical service industry is creating various services and added value for promotion of health. Aging, extension of life expectancy, increase in lifestyle and income growth have brought about a change in paradigm of medical service which led smart health to become an important issue. Smart health caused medical service for promotion of health to change into remote medical treatment that uses personal health record from medical service which has been provided by mainly large hospitals. Medical service for promotion of health has developed into u-Healthcare which monitors condition of health in everyday life. This enabled problems of time and space constraints that occur in medical service for promotion of health that requires a medical doctor to examine bio-signal related information of a patient while facing a patient to be solved. It is difficult for a remote medical treatment to care for chronic patients who require a care of lifestyle because it focuses on treating specific diseases. As a remote medical treatment does not provide innovative medical service and it only delivers general bio information on a patient to a medical doctor remotely, remote medical open platform is needed. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a PHR open platform based smart health services using the distributed object group framework. A PHR open platform based smart health system is distributed object group framework based smart health service for managing chronic diseases. When Medical WBAN sensor uses multi-channel in transmitting data, emergency data is very important in patient's life, smart health environment is built using distributed network considering importance according to data. As WBAN sensor is very different from other networks in terms of application, architecture and density of development, it is important for WBAN sensor to be combined with external network. High quality of service of integrated network as well as link connectivity should be maintained. Since automatic diagnosis function should be reinforced in order for remote diagnosis service to be provided, integration of each small unit system and model design are important. Therefore, smart health network environment that makes the most of performance of distributed network based on automation technique and distributed agent for optimum design of system is built.",

abstract="With the rapid increase in number of sensing devices for healthcare, researchers are getting growing interest due to wide application support and new challenging scenarios. Internet of Things (IoT) comprises of huge number of connected devices with a variety of sensing support especially in medical health parameters sensing. In these scenarios, secure data collection and transmission to centralized servers is quite challenging to protect against several attacks for illegal data access. Existing solutions suffer from storage, communication and energy overheads. To resolve these issues, this paper presents a FoG assisted scheme for healthcare data aggregation in a secure and efficient manner.. We have involved the peer-to-peer communication between healthcare sensing devices and wearables to share secret data with an aggregating node that can share data with FoG server. In this scenario, an aggregator may be away from FoG server and cannot transmit data directly. However, it can share the encrypted data with the neighboring aggregator to transmit data to FoG server by appending in its current aggregated data. FoG server can extract the required values from the data and can save in the local repository that can be further updated later in cloud repositories. For these functionalities, we have presented two algorithms for message receiving at aggregator and message extraction at FoG server. Moreover, compression mechanism is also presented to further reduce the communication costs. We have performed simulations using TCL and C files in NS2.35 to generate trace files and then executed AWK scripts to extract results. Results prove the supremacy of proposed scheme over existing schemes in terms of storage, communication, transmission ratio, energy consumption and resilience.",

However, the nations are still bound together only through humanness amidst diversity and not merely through technological exchanges. We found that most of the prevailing technologies come with an inherent challenge that is tradeoff between cost and affordability. For example, a recent study by World Bank and World Health Organization on expenditure towards healthcare, education and other essentials shows an alarmingly increasing rate on expenditure thereby making affordability to get access to such benefits a critical problem to solve in general. These are also the fields where maximum technological advancements are happening today. Our paper focuses predominantly on this tradeoff especially those challenges faced by senior citizens, super senior citizens, economically marginalized sect of people and differently abled. Our work also looks at the means on how technologies could assist them to live independently and get access to some of the emerging technologies without actually knowing the intricacies. Our purpose is also to bring technology that is affordable, implementable at lower cost and that delivers higher efficiency with maximized reach in society. We hence chose this study of adoption of emerging and open source technologies such as semantics and their indispensable role in serving the society.",

abstract="Due to the development of IT convergence technologies, increased attention has focused on smart health service platforms to detect emergency situations related to chronic disease, telemedicine, silvercare, and wellness. Moreover, there is a high demand for technologies that can properly judge a situation and provide suitable countermeasures or health information if an emergency situation occurs. In this paper, we propose the sequential pattern analysis based bio-detection for smart health services. A smart health service platform is able to save bio-images and their locations detected in a smart health surveillance area where CCD cameras are installed. When a person's figure is saved, the route tracing detects any movement and then traces its location. In addition, the platform analyzes the perceived bio-images and sequential patterns in order to determine whether or not the emergency situation is normal. Using AprioirAll algorithm-based sequential pattern profile analysis, bio-detection can detect a user who is undergoing an emergency based on abnormal patterns. It performs this task by managing information obtained from data and trace analyses, and it starts bio-detection only when there are patterns not conforming to sequential patterns. In other words, bio-detection detects the maximum sequence that can satisfy the minimum support in a given transaction. Sequential pattern profile analysis based on life-logs can analyze normal and abnormal profiles to provide health guidelines.",

However, this calls for technological solutions that suit their specific needs and capabilities. The Sweet-Home project aims at developing a new user friendly technology for home automation based on voice command. This paper reports a user evaluation assessing the acceptance and fear of this new technology. Eight healthy persons between 71 and 88 years old, 7 relatives (child, grandchild or friend) and 3 professional carers participated in a user evaluation. During about 45 min, the persons were questioned in co-discovery in the Domus smart home alternating between interview and wizard of Oz periods followed by a debriefing. The experience aimed at testing four important aspects of the project: voice command, communication with the outside world, domotics system interrupting a person's activity, and electronic agenda. Voice interface appeared to have a great potential to ease daily living for elderly and frail persons and would be better accepted than more intrusive solutions. By considering still healthy and independent elderly people in the user evaluation, an interesting finding that came up is their overall acceptance provided the system does not drive them to a lazy lifestyle by taking control of everything. This particular fear must be addressed for the development of smart homes that support daily living by giving them more ability to control rather than putting them away from the daily routine.",

However, control and management of these devices are not convenient. In this paper a universal multi-layer intelligent service platform, which provides efficient operations and various value-added services, is proposed for indoor IoT systems. The platform has a flexible framework which consists at most four layers: terminal, gateway, local server and cloud server layers. Several combinations among these layers are designed for different situations. Also the platform provides features of lightweight, intelligent, personalized and secure. The following issues of proposed platform are discussed in details: (1) different layers and their combinations; (2) ESP8266 based lightweight terminals and gateway constitution; (3) general components of a server, deployment of multiple servers and procedures of intelligent services; (4) multiple human-computer interaction interfaces including web/mobile APP, intelligent speaker and unified remote control; (5) communication protocols between different entities and an example; (6) possible intelligent services and an example.",

abstract="With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies, mobile healthcare (mHealth) can offer remote, accurate, and effective medical services for patients according to their personal health records (PHRs). However, data security and efficient access of the PHR should be addressed. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is regarded as a well-received cryptographic mechanism to simultaneously realize fine-grained access control and data confidentiality in mHealth. Nevertheless, existing works are either constructed in the single-authority setting which may be a performance bottleneck, or lack of efficient user decryption. In this paper, we propose SEMAAC, a secure and efficient multi-authority access control system for IoT-enabled mHealth. In SEMAAC, there are multiple independently worked attribute authorities (AAs). A new entity could be an AA without re-building the system. To reduce the user decryption overhead, most decryption is executed in cloud server, which whereafter returns a partial decryption ciphertext (PDC). The AAs can help the user to check if the PDC is correctly computed. Additionally, a restricted user can delegate his/her key to someone to outsource the decryption and check the returned result, without exposing the plaintext PHR file. The proposed SEMAAC is proved to be adaptively secure in the standard model. The numerical analysis and extensive experiments illustrate the efficiency and advantage of our scheme.",

abstract="A challenge associated with an ageing population is increased demand on health and social care, creating a greater need to enable persons to live independently in their own homes. Ambient assistant living technology aims to address this by monitoring occupants' `activities of daily living' using smart home sensors to alert caregivers to abnormalities in routine tasks and deteriorations in a person's ability to care for themselves. However, there has been less focus on using sensing technology to monitor a broader scope of so-called `meaningful activities', which promote a person's emotional, creative, intellectual, and spiritual needs. In this paper, we describe the development of a toolkit comprised of off-the-shelf, affordable sensors to allow persons with dementia and Parkinson's disease to monitor meaningful activities as well as activities of daily living in order to self-manage their life and well-being. We describe two evaluations of the toolkit, firstly a lab-based study to test the installation of the system including the acuity and placement of sensors and secondly, an in-the-wild study where subjects who were not target users of the toolkit, but who identified as technology enthusiasts evaluated the feasibility of the toolkit to monitor activities in and around real homes. Subjects from the in-the-wild study reported minimal obstructions to installation and were able to carry out and enjoy activities without obstruction from the sensors, revealing that meaningful activities may be monitored remotely using affordable, passive sensors. We propose that our toolkit may enhance assistive living systems by monitoring a wider range of activities than activities of daily living.",

Therefore, mHealth plays an imperative role in the sustainable delivery of healthcare services in telemedicine. This paper presents a comprehensive review of healthcare service provision. It highlights the open issues and challenges related to the use of the real-time fault-tolerant mHealth system in telemedicine. The methodological aspects of mHealth are examined, and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first discusses the identification process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of `time of arrival of patient at the hospital/multi-services' and `hospitals' within mHealth. The second phase discusses the development of a decision matrix for hospital selection based on the MAHP method. The third phase discusses the validation of the proposed system.",

A smart home scenario is characterized by enabled intelligent interworking of various wireless and wired technologies to provide inhabitants with ease of use of appliances, while creating a personalized and safe ambience space. More and more high and low data rate circulates within the indoor ambient space (e.g., home, hospitals, offices). Although, unlicensed technologies, such as wireless local area networks can take upon part of the indoor traffic, the ever increasing demand for such data, and users, calls for either use of licensed or novel unlicensed wireless communication technologies as part of the smart home enablers. This paper focuses on the potentials of visible light communications (VLCs), jointly with radio and fiber communications, to support very dense low and high data rate connectivity, while enabling deployment of secure-sensitive indoor applications, including indoor tracking and localization. The paper proposes a scenario for integrating VLC into the smart home scenario and a conceptual supporting architecture for its deployment. Further, the technical challenges and possible roadmap for the actual deployment are analyzed for the particular case of an eHealth scenario where the utilization of VLC technology is the enabler of the cost-efficient rollout of the required infrastructure and thus the game-changer in a multi-billion eHealth niche that is seeking for cost affordable solutions.",

Thecase of Ebola epidemic in West Africa in recent years has shown the need for pervasive screening. The trend today in diseases surveillance is consisting of epidemiological data collection about emerging infectious diseases using social media, wearable sensors systems, or mobile applications and data analysis. This approach presents various limitations. This paper proposes a novel approach for diseases monitoring and risk prevention of spreading infectious diseases. The proposed approach, aiming at overcoming the limitation of existing disease surveillance approaches, combines the hybrid crowdsensing paradigm with sensing individuals' bio-signals using optical sensors for monitoring any risks of spreading emerging infectious diseases in any (ad-hoc) crowds. A proof-of-concept has been performed using a drone armed with a cat s60 smartphone featuring a Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) camera. According to the results of the conducted experiment, the concept has the potential to improve the conventional epidemiological data collection. The measurement is reliable, and the recorded data are valid. The measurement error rates are about 8{\%}.",

This paper examines the coping strategies of Japanese society, in the shortage of caring services, with socio-techno innovations derived from information and communication technologies (ICT), towards ageing-in-place. Mobile phone and e-communications promise for borderless, flexible and ubiquitous contacts: real time, round-the-clock, anytime and anywhere, making the geo-spatial conditions irrelevant and for all age groups, but are these offerings for the beneficiaries of an ageing society? Mobile communicative gadgets become social necessity for most Japanese and they are used for intensive social networking; for instance, the mobile phone's role in friendship-building among younger generations---but what about the senior adults for the place anchorage for active ageing? This paper examines and discusses the socio-familial-spatial (social networking, location and place) relevance of mobile communication, emphasizing the use of ICT and mobile communication by/with/for ageing population, for realizing the benefits of ageing-in-place. It especially considers elderly and their families, in the need for socially and geo-spatially fixed anchors (the essence of ageing-in-place), despite (or perhaps because of) the `mobility' through ICT. Our key observations: the trend towards the intensification of ICT use, though affecting differential inter-personal relationship, evidently enables the practice for ageing-in-place in the information age.",

abstract="The number of aged and disabled people has been increasing worldwide. To look after these people is a big challenge in this era. However, scientists overcome the problems of handicapped people with the help of the latest communication technologies. The smart home and medical systems are a predominant concept in research and development, specially utilizing the brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to control the daily use appliances. BCI acquires the brain signals that transmit to a digital device for analyzing and interpreting into further command or action but this approach limits the communication range between the brain and the system and becomes bulky because of the wired interface of a brain with the system. Therefore, the main purpose of this research was to design and evaluate a system that empowered the immobilized, handicapped or elderly people to carry out their basic routine tasks wirelessly, for instance, operating home appliances and monitoring vital signs without any dependency. In addition, the subject should have a properly functioning brain and controlled with eye muscle movement. In this research work, wireless BCI (WBCI) technology that is a commercial electroencephalogram headset is used to control home and medical appliances such as a light bulb, a fan, a digital blood pressure monitor and an Infrared deep pain therapeutic belt for dependent people. An Android application is developed name ``Smart Home Monitor'' that monitors the data from the headset. The designed device is tested on younger (50-year-old) and older (>{\thinspace}50-year-old) individuals to achieve an attention level (0--100). The younger male reached attention level 74.78 within 26.20 s; quicker than younger female and older people. Overall, this research work is unique for the reason that it is suitable for all those people, whose brain and eye muscles are functional even if the rest of the body is paralyzed. This analysis evaluated WBCI device enables the system to be wireless, handy, portable and reliable. Thus, the whole system can be commercialized for immobilized or handicapped people to provide better care and facility at home. Especially, the disable people appreciated this system and want to see its implementation as soon as possible.",

abstract="The remote health monitoring system (RHMS) has become more real-time because the internet plus technology develops quickly. To support real-time health monitoring server, three main aspects, such as collecting, transferring and analyzing the health data, should be integrated into a system. So far, many challenges have been solved and many RHMSs have been applied in our daily lives. It is significant to use RHMS to take good care of clients who live alone, especially monitors the health data of clients in nursing home. This paper introduces a health gateway which automatically collects information of the clients. The information includes the users' identity, vital signs, body temperature, clients' real-time location and falling action detection. Moreover, the health gateway transmits information in WIFI relaying mode until the information is received by the background server. If the information is abnormal, the health gateway would send an alarm to the server. The server should call a doctor or caretaker and send accurate navigation based on real-time location in 3D architectural modeling to their mobile devices for finding clients quickly.",

One such application is activity recognition and prediction. Activity recognition is used in many real world settings, such as assisted living systems. Although activity recognition has been vastly studied by many researchers, the temporal features that constitute an activity, which can provide useful insights for activity models, have not been exploited to their full potentials by mining algorithms. In this paper, we utilize temporal features for activity recognition and prediction in assisted living settings. We discover temporal relations such as the order of activities, as well as their corresponding start time and duration features.

abstract="One major challenge to successful aging is the capability to preserve health, or from another perspective to avoid disease. Unfortunately, a large percentage of the elderly people are living with chronic diseases or disabilities. Home care technologies and other emerging technologies have the potential to play a major role in home-based health care approach. The advent of sensor technology, in addition to telecom industry has made this possible. The main goal of the presented research in this paper is to develop a cost-effective user-friendly telehealth system to serve the elderly and disabled people in the community. The research also aims at utilizing the state-of-the-art advances in medical instrumentation technology to establish a continuous communication link between patients and caregivers and allow physicians to offer help when needed. Hence, we are presenting here an integrated user-friendly model of a smart home which provides telemedicine for elderly at home. The general problem addressed in this paper is that of offering a smart environment which monitors the elderly continuously as he moves around at home, and sends an emergency call for help in case of an occurrence of an accident or a severe health problem. The paper focuses on implementation details and practical considerations of integrating the diverse technologies into a working system.",

Ideally, indoor multi-modal interactions and ambient changes happened in smart homes could be monitored using ambient intelligence technology for instantaneous human behavior analysis and following human-centered interactions. Such quick feedbacks are significant to the elderly and disabled people, because a successful smart living environment could greatly reduce the burden on their home cares by offering appropriate assistance according to recognized human behaviors. However, due to varied behavioral patterns and imprecise data acquisition, realizing complex human activity in real-time without controversy over privacy is one of the biggest challenges for scientific community. In this paper, we propose an innovative inference engine based on formal concept analysis to recognize complex human activities, including sequential, interleaved, and concurrent patterns performed by an occupant in non-intrusive smart homes. Besides the on-the-fly recognition, our engine adopts a loose coupling architecture that strengthens the software robustness, reliability, and knowledge reusability.",

The KSERA (Knowledgeable SErvice Robots for Aging) project integrates smart home technology and a socially-assistive robot to extend independent living for elderly people, in particular those with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). The social robot is the most visible component of the system playing the role of communication interface between the elderly, the smart home, and the external world. The robot's behavior is determined in part by sensor information gathered through the smart home. To ensure user acceptance, we used user-centered design to implement the robot's behavior. This paper describes the KSERA system, how it was developed based on user needs, treatment plans, and lab studies, and how we validated the approach through user studies and field trials. The key enabling technologies for successful socially-assistive robots include person- and self-localization abilities, person-aware navigation, speech recognition and generation, robot gestures, emulated emotions, eye contact and joint attention, and audio-video communication with family members and care givers.",

By reducing cost and gaining control in building smart transportation management systems, IBM provided a grant to the city of Chicago to reinvigorate Chicago's K-12 schools and city college. Similarly, Catherine Bracy (https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/catherine-bracy/) and her team at Code for America are using technology to ``build governments for the people and by the people in the twenty-first century.'' It is evident that smart cities should accommodate every citizen, most especially those who may struggle with accessing information through conventional mediums. Specifically, smart cities must ensure that full participation is available to those citizens with communication and learning disabilities and new immigrant populations who experience difficulties understanding the language of their new home county. The biggest challenge for these citizens is using the Internet for learning because of the need to read, view, or listen to content published online. Disabled students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses at colleges and universities are at a particular disadvantage since the use of empirical observation is critical in scientific learning and research. In this paper, we propose an intervention using a new software product and workflow for video captioning---a Universal Video Captioning platform (UVC). This platform provides a semi-automatic approach to synchronize the captioning into accessible STEM-related videos. It has the potential to transform learning and teaching for students with disabilities and those whose native language is not English by integrating synchronized captioned educational videos into undergraduate and graduate STEM disciplines. While accessing scientific content can pose unique challenges for disabled students and those who have just started learning a new language, the UVC platform has the potential to provide students with disabilities and recent immigrants the ability to pursue new and deeper learning opportunities.",

abstract="Activity recognition is an important step towards monitoring and evaluating the functional health of an individual, and it potentially promotes human-centric ubiquitous applications in smart homes particularly for senior healthcare. The nature of human activity characterized by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty, however, poses a great challenge to the design of good feature representations and the optimization of classifiers towards building a robust model for human activity recognition. In this study, we propose to exploit deep learning techniques to automatically learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminative latent patterns inherent in the simple low-level features. Specifically, we extract high-level features with a stacked autoencoder that has a deep and hierarchy architecture, and combine feature learning and classifier construction into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. Besides, we investigate two different original feature representations of the sensor data for latent feature learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available smart home datasets, and compare it with a range of shallow models in terms of time-slice accuracy and class accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better recognition rates and generalizes better across different original feature representations, indicating its applicability to the real-world activity recognition.",

In this context, ambient intelligence (AmI) and social networking sites (SNSs) can promote independent living and social integration, improve their health, reduce the chances for developing cognitive decline, and ultimately prevent earlier death. The aim of this paper was to review the literature about how AmI and SNS technologies have been applied in the social integration of elderly adults. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted, which analyzed and classified computational approaches to address the issues of social isolation and social integration of elderly adults. This study revealed a wide variety of research works that are based on AmI and SNS technologies to keep older adults socially active. The paper also identifies the main technological resources and strategies to encourage social integration in this segment of the population. We concluded that this research field is still emerging and there is room for significant contributions.",

abstract="As IT convergence technique develops, medical technology and apparatus are being modernized opening the era that we can obtain variable information easily anywhere, anytime thanks to wireless communication developed, further. These social changes enabled us to obtain information related to health more efficiently. Modern society is rapidly aging and more people experience chronic diseases because of their wrong eating habit, obesity and insufficient exercise. Thus a demand for health improvement and management at a certain term is increasing rather than complete therapy. Previously, major medical institutions managed personal medical history regarding patients mainly in health management but it is not changing its method to self-utilization and management by individual patient as of now along with medical institutions as fusion technology develops, and individual health record information can easily be checked anywhere, anytime through personal health record (PHR) platform. Unlike developing speed of related technology, however, there is a limitation in expansion, development of individual health record service, personal information security currently. In this paper, we propose mobile service regarding life style improvement targeting high risk chronic diseases based on PHR platform. PHR platform determines high blood pressure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia diseases which are three main chronic diseases using users' data and can monitor chronic diseases in portable mobile device. Also, the service provides by organically, mutually connected form through feedback towards input from health states of users in mobile device. By proposing contents about service based on efficient individual health record through mobile device that maximized transportability based on PHR platform, proposed method will contribute to industry development and activation of application service development of individual health record. Increase in consistency and reliability through standardization of afterwards health management service is expected to contribute to reduction in social cost and improvement of national health being the basis to realize communication activation of health record between medical institutions, efficient management and education of patients, reduction in dual examinations.",

abstract="This paper explores the relationship between dignity and robot care for older people. It highlights the disquiet that is often expressed about failures to maintain the dignity of vulnerable older people, but points out some of the contradictory uses of the word `dignity'. Certain authors have resolved these contradictions by identifying different senses of dignity; contrasting the inviolable dignity inherent in human life to other forms of dignity which can be present to varying degrees. The capability approach (CA) is introduced as a different but tangible account of what it means to live a life worthy of human dignity. It is used here as a framework for the assessment of the possible effects of eldercare robots on human dignity. The CA enables the identification of circumstances in which robots could enhance dignity by expanding the set of capabilities that are accessible to frail older people. At the same time, it is also possible within its framework to identify ways in which robots could have a negative impact, by impeding the access of older people to essential capabilities. It is concluded that the CA has some advantages over other accounts of dignity, but that further work and empirical study is needed in order to adapt it to the particular circumstances and concerns of those in the latter part of their lives.",

Because FC reduces latency and power consumption, it is suitable for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications as healthcare, vehicles, and smart cities. In FC, the mobile devices (MDs) can offload their heavy tasks to fog devices (FDs). The selection of best FD for offloading has serious challenges in the time and energy. In this paper, we present a Module Placement method by Classification and regression tree Algorithm (MPCA). We select the best FDs for modules by MPCA. Initially, the power consumption of MDs are checked, if this value is greater than Wi-Fi's power consumption, then offloading will be done. The MPCA's decision parameters for selecting the best FD include authentication, confidentiality, integrity, availability, capacity, speed, and cost. To optimize MPCA, we analyze and apply the probability of network's resource utilization in the module offloading. This method is called by (MPMCP). To evaluate our proposed approach, we simulate MPCA and MPMCP algorithms and compare them with First Fit (FF) and local mobile processing methods in Cloud, FDs, and MDs. The results include the power consumption, response time and performance show that the proposed methods are superior to other compared methods.",

abstract="In recent years, the concept of smart homes and smart buildings have gradually emerged as mainstream with the development of sensor technology and the introduction of several commercial solutions. As one of the most important aspect of this technical-driven smart home system, learning and recognizing the occupant's routine activities and movement patterns is the foundation of further human behavior understanding and prediction process. In this paper, we propose a decomposition based unsupervised learning approach, which is able to learn the occupant's moving patterns directly from the sensor data without event annotations. It overcomes the limitation suffered by a lot of other supervised learning approaches that sensor data sets with event annotations are not difficult to collect since manually data labeling is not scalable and extremely time consuming. By applying the proposed method on Aruba motion sensor data set, we show that the decomposition based pattern learning method leverages the well-developed Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm that it can learn the movement pattern candidates of the occupant very fast, with outputs that can be easily interpreted.",

abstract="In recent years, health-care industry has received a major boost due to sensors i.e., accelerometers, magnetometers etc., which allow its user to get instant updates about their current health status in indoor/outdoor environments. The real driving force behind the usage of accelerometer has been the fitness industry but it also holds a prominent place in ambient smart home to monitor resident's life-style. In this paper, we proposed a novel triaxial accelerometer-based human motion detection and recognition system using multiple features and random forest. Triaxial signals have been statistically processed to produce worthy features like variance, positive and negative peaks, and signal magnitude features. The proposed model was evaluated over HMP recognition data sets and achieved satisfactory recognition accuracy of 85.17{\%}. The proposed system is directly applicable to any elderly/children health monitoring system, 3D animated games/movies and examining the indoor behaviors of people at home, malls and offices.",

abstract="One of the main objectives of smart homes is healthcare monitoring and assistance, especially for elderly and disabled people. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the inhabitant behavior is very helpful to provide the required assistance. This work aims to propose a prediction model that satisfies the accuracy as well as the rapidity of the learning phase. To do so, we propose to improve the existing extreme learning machine (ELM) model by defining a recurrent form. This form ensures a temporal relationship of inputs between observations at different time steps. The new model uses feedback connections to the input layer from the output layer which allows the output to be included in the long-term prediction. A recurrent dynamic network, with feedback connections of the output of the network, is proposed to predict the future series representing future activities of the inhabitant. The resulting model, called Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (RELM), provides the ability to learn the human behavior and ensures a good balance between the learning time and the prediction accuracy. The input data is based on the real data representing the activities of persons belonging to the profile of first level (i.e. P1) as measured by the dependency model called Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) used in the geriatric domain. The experimental results reveal that the proposed RELM model requires a minimum time during the learning phase with a better performance compared to existing models.",

More and more software resources are developed and existed in the format as services on the Internet. These services from multi-domains and multi-networks are converged as a huge complicated service network or ecosystem, which can be called as Big Service. How to reuse the abundant open service resources to rapidly develop the new applications or comprehensive service solutions to meet massive individualized customer requirements is a key issue in the big data and big service ecosystem. Based on analyzing the ecosystem of big service, this paper presents a new paradigm of software service engineering, Requirement-Engineering Two-Phase of Service Engineering Paradigm (RE2SEP), which includes service oriented requirement engineering, domain oriented service engineering, and the development approach of software services. By means of the RE2SEP approach, the adaptive service solutions can be efficiently designed and implemented to match the requirement propositions of massive individualized customers in Big Service ecosystem. A case study of the RE2SEP applications, which is a project on citizens mobility service in smart city environment, is also given in this paper. The RE2SEP paradigm will change the way of traditional life-cycle oriented software engineering, and lead a new approach of software service engineering.",

To achieve this, the main concepts related to asthma and context awareness are explained before describing and analysing the existing context-aware systems aiding asthma. The survey shows that the concept of personalisation is the key when developing context-aware solutions supporting asthma management because of the high level of heterogeneity of this condition. Hence, the benefits and challenges of context-aware systems supporting asthma management are strongly linked to contextual Just-In-Time information of internal and external factors related to a person and the heterogeneity it represents.",

abstract="The smart home as emerged in recent years as a new trend of research aiming to propose an alternative to postpone the institutionalization of cognitively-impaired people. These habitats are intended to provide security, guidance and direct support services to its resident. To fulfill this important mission, an algorithm first has to identify the ongoing activities of its user by tracking, in real time, the position of the main daily living objects. Many researchers addressed this issue by proposing systems based ultrasonic wave sensors, video cameras, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). However, the RFID technology, constitutes the most viable technology for smart homes. Recently, several RFID localization algorithms have been developed, mainly for commercial and industrial uses, but they are not precise enough to be used in an assistive context. Furthermore, the majority of them focuses on systems exploiting active RFID tags, which need batteries and are much more expensive. We present, in this paper, a new algorithmic approach for passive RFID localization in smart homes based on elliptical trilateration and fuzzy logic. This new algorithm has been implemented in a real smart home infrastructure. It has been rigorously tested and outperformed the comparable approaches.",

abstract="Recent studies report that the majority of older adults wish to live in their own homes, for as long as possible. This creates a growing interest in technologies to enable older people to remain living independently at home. The purpose of this article is to provide a narrative review of current technology appropriate for older adults' home use. The key research questions were as follow: 1- What is the evidence demonstrating that gerontechnologies are effective in enabling independent living? 2- What are devices designed specifically for frail elderly persons ? Several publications were identified about devices targeting social isolation (videophonic communication, affective orthotic devices or companion-type robots, personal emergency response systems [security]), autonomy loss (technologies for maintenance of autonomy in the activities of daily living) and cognitive disorders (cognitive orthotics, wandering management systems, telemonitoring). Very few articles dealt specifically with the frail older person. In particular, there was extremely limited evidence on use and efficacy of these devices within this population. There is a need to obtain a consensus on definition of the technologies, and also to revisit work strategies and develop innovative business models. To meet this goal, we need to create a network of technological companies, aging services organizations, end-users, academics, and government representatives to explore the real needs of the frail older population and to develop and validate new devices promoting aging at home.",

abstract="As the Irish population ages, the potential role of information and communication technologies (ICT) to assist with community care has gained prominence, as it has in many Western nations. However, little is known about how the perceptions and preferences of older people (as current care users) and the general population (as prospective care users) are constructed for ICT within the context of existing community-care provision and orthodox person-led care programs. This paper aims to address this deficit for the Irish context and contribute to international knowledge on this topic. Data for the research comes from four case studies of community care sites, three focus-group discussions and 60 face-to-face exploratory survey interviews (based around stated-preference scenarios) with a general population sample. Care preferences were rooted in orthodox forms of person-led care provision. Perceptions of technology, experience/familiarity with technology, and difficulty conceptualizing technology and need for technology assistance, are interconnected in how they influence ICT preferences and acceptance. More dominant, however, were micro- and macro-contextual factors associated with community care, namely (1) the state of the older adult community care sector; (2) the desire for person-to-person contact; (3) the context of place.",

Assistive Smart Homes (SH) are a promising form of technology enabling assistance with activities of daily living, providing support of suffers of cognitive ailments and increasing their independence and quality of life. Traditional SH systems have deficiencies that have been partially addressed by through goal-driven SH systems. Goal-driven SHs incorporate flexible activity models, goals, which partially address some of these issues. Goals may be combined to provide assistance with dynamic and variable activities. This paradigm-shift, however, introduces the need to provide dynamic assistance within such SHs.

abstract="Today's medical industry can be represented by a human-centered u-healthcare paradigm that is available and accessible anywhere, where high-tech IT can serve as the basis at any time and any place. In addition, in the medical industry, studies of many of the developments and applications are actively conducted based on the development of information communication technology. The aim of medical-information systems is the construction of an advanced IT and integrated u-healthcare system that evolves in the direction of integrated medical-based IT-convergence systems. Accordingly, to resolve the problems of telemedicine, in terms of the remote access to medical data, some public and private initiatives have been proposed, ranging from patient-mobility approaches to medical data. In addition, regarding GENICloud, which provides links with the existing future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud, two out of the seven GENIAM APIs have been announced as the common APIs of the future Internet testbeds in GENI, and they have been implemented and are provided. In the present GENI Cloud system, due to the provision of limited APIs, restrictions may occur in the future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud system management. Therefore, this study proposes a cloud-based mobile health service for the enhancement of the quality of service (QoS) including factors such as reliability and response time to resolve the problems of the broadband-communication infrastructure in the existing mobile health service and the delay problem on the wireless body area network. In this paper, we propose the cloud-based u-healthcare network with a QoS-guaranteed mobile health service. For this method, the TMO-distribution object model that was used in the existing research to implement a reliable and efficient cloud system for users was not used, and instead, a cloud-platform environment was built up through the construction of a distributed system based on a cluster-based mobile object. For this purpose, this study considered the characteristics of the wireless-communication environments between the terminals and the cloud servers in the mobile cloud environment and the proposed cloud mobility services and the specialized mobile cloud-control software. Later, for linkages with cloud computing environments and testbeds was proposed. In addition, this study carried out a cloud mobility-control design to provide a service in the mobile cloud environment that is based on the actual future Internet testbeds. Lastly, based on the structured cloud-platform environment, this study designed access interfaces to provide a mobile healthcare service in consideration of the user convenience. For the mobile-service access interfaces, since the same service interfaces can be used to access the characteristics and functions of all of the applications from browsers and device clients, the model-view-controller structure of the platform was designed, including the components for the further improvement of the requirements, reuse, and maintenance of the codes in medium and large distributed systems.",

abstract="With the increase of connected devices and online services, and recently IoT devices, the number of notifications received by every person is growing. The importance of notifications, as they become part of people's lives, often depends on various factors that can differently influence the reaction and the disruption of recipients. For this reason, the generation and the distribution of notifications has been gaining importance in the design of new applications, services, and smart devices. Nowadays, developers have not yet fully exploited all the advantages that the availability of multiple devices could bring in the customization and the distribution of notifications, e.g., exploiting a cross-device approach. This paper presents XDN (cross device notification), a framework to assist developers in creating cross-device notifications by scripting. The XDN architecture includes: a library to enable developers to design personalized notifications to be distributed among ad-hoc networks of IoT/mobile devices; a GUI to assist developers in implementing and testing (through a simulator) notification strategies; a server-side runtime environment; and an XDN IoT/mobile library for device support. We discuss the requirements for cross device notification systems, and we present the features of the XDN framework, in particular from the point of view of developer advantages, validated through different scenarios.",

Although the number of smart wearable users has grown significantly, there is still a lack of academic researches on what motivates and prevents the continued usage of these devices. Hence, the main objectives of this study are, namely: to explain the impediments and affecting factors in deciding to use smart wellness wearables from a user's perspective; and to propose a unified model to explore the impact of these factors on an individual's behavioral intentions. Accordingly, the ``Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2'' and the ``Value-based Adoption Model'' were integrated with two additional factors, namely perceived trust and perceived health increase. Following this, a survey was conducted among students and 100 reliable responses were received. As a result of this study, the Confirmatory Factor Analysis from the developed instrument is presented. The findings have confirmed the validity and reliability of the developed instrument. This paper also presents the theoretical understanding of the involved factors in the proposed model.",

abstract="It is well known that help prompts shape how users talk to spoken dialogue systems. This study investigated the effect of help prompt placement on older users' interaction with a smart home interface. In the dynamic help condition, help was only given in response to system errors; in the inherent help condition, it was also given at the start of each task. Fifteen older and sixteen younger users interacted with a smart home system using two different scenarios. Each scenario consisted of several tasks. The linguistic style users employed to communicate with the system (interaction style) was measured using the ratio of commands to the overall utterance length (keyword ratio) and the percentage of content words in the user's utterance that could be understood by the system (shared vocabulary). While the timing of help prompts did not affect the interaction style of younger users, it was early task-specific help supported older users in adapting their interaction style to the system's capabilities. Well-placed help prompts can significantly increase the usability of spoken dialogue systems for older people.",

abstract="Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person households, it is absolutely necessary to observe the indoor activities of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection.",

abstract="Alzheimer disease (AD) and other related dementia represent a major challenge for health care systems within the aging population. It is therefore important to develop better instruments for assessing disease severity and disease progression to optimize patient's care and support to care providers, and also provide better tools for clinical research. In this area, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are of particular interest. Such techniques enable accurate and standardized assessments of patients' performance and actions in real time and real life situations. The aim of this article is to provide basic recommendation concerning the development and the use of ICT for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. During he ICT and Mental Health workshop (CTAD meeting held in Monaco on the 30th October 2012) an expert panel was set up to prepare the first recommendations for the use of ICT in dementia research. The expert panel included geriatrician, epidemiologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, ICT engineers, representatives from the industry and patient association. The recommendations are divided into three sections corresponding to 1/ the clinical targets of interest for the use of ICT, 2/ the conditions, the type of sensors and the outputs (scores) that could be used and obtained, 3/ finally the last section concerns specifically the use of ICT within clinical trials.",

Within this article the latest version of homeML, version 2.2 is presented, where the `annotationDetails' element is introduced. An extended evaluation of the homeML Suite is also discussed. A usability and functionality study was conducted by a number of experienced researchers working within the domain of smart environments. The methodology of both studies is discussed in detail. Each participant's interactions with homeML and the suite of tools is presented, the findings of which have been positive. All participants agreed that the homeML Suite would be a useful tool to be available within the research domain and they would recommend it to their fellow researchers.",

abstract="The number of people afflicted with chronic illnesses such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes has soared in recent years, generating new kinds of disparate medical challenges. In turn, these challenges have resulted in skyrocketing costs, preventable deaths, and medical malpractice claims. For example, studies have found nearly half of all US patients receive inadequate care each year, over 2 million are harmed by hospital-acquired infections, and over 1 million suffer disabling complications during surgery -- even though half of these are thought to be avoidable. These challenges have catalyzed the beginning of a transformation in care delivery, from a health-care system that focuses on disease to one that must look after patients -- including individuals and communities. To provide proper treatment to those who are chronically ill, the health-care system has to support improved individuals' health-related practices prior to the manifestation of disease; ensure that a range of practitioners can deliver quality clinical care during the onset of an illness; and facilitate patient-provider-family partnerships during post-disease wellness care. As we describe in this review, key advances in networking and information technologies -- spanning patient monitoring, data visualization and decision making, robotics and computer vision for diagnosis and surgery, social networking for fostering community-based support systems, and so on -- stand to drive forward these changes. Together with social scientists, systems engineers, medical practitioners, and computer scientists, information systems scholars can help alter the nature of care delivery well into the twenty-first century, ultimately contributing to a system that is much more safe, effective, reliable, and timely than it is today.",

Wireless medical sensor networks capable of accumulating and transferring vital parameters of patients play a crucial role in remote health monitoring. Security and privacy are major concerns preventing the patients from adopting this technology with an open mind. This paper presents a signature-based authentication protocol for remote health monitoring. The work also discusses an authentication protocol for the mutual authentication of users and medical server. The protocol does not require the server to maintain a password table. The proposed algorithms are resistant to various attacks such as replay attack, stolen verifier attack, and privileged insider attack. The work includes the informal and formal security analysis of the proposed protocols. Scyther tool is used for formal security analysis and the results show that the protocol is resistant to various common and automated attacks.",

abstract="As infinite competition and materialism have become severe in the current society, stress management has emerged as a main topic. There are many causes that create stress, including external factors and personal events. Also, stress has different levels, depending on an individuals' subjective analysis. Stress has high correlations with cardiovascular disorders and mental illness. In particular, long-term stress leads to lowered immunity, which makes people more exposed to various diseases, and brings personal and social costs. With the rapid development of the IoT, it has been easy to analyze and manage stress with the use of sensors and communications technology relating to the human body and its surroundings. This study proposes a heart-rate variability-based stress index service using a biosensor. The proposed method collects a variety of information in dual physical environments (such as temperature, humidity, and brightness) from IoT devices, and analyzes it in real-time. The discomfort index and wind chill temperature index offered by the Korea Meteorological Administration, and the temperature, humidity, noise, and brightness collected from a biosensor are the most clear factors to digitize the physical environments of stress. Also, a smart health platform analyzes different heart rates depending on individual conditions, and monitors current status. For a heart rate, the frequency of the R-R value and low frequency (LF) are analyzed. For R-R value, a maximum value detection algorithm is applied. For LF analysis, Fourier transform is used. Generally, fast Fourier transform is unable to analyze the relation between time and frequency. Accordingly, applied is a short time Fourier transform in which window size is limited in a graph so as to express an effect made by changing time effectively. A stress index is comprised of discomfort level, wind chill temperature, noise, brightness, and heart rate. The notification of risk is given to the user by signal lights indicating stability, warning, or danger. The stress index service enables a user to check the stress index in real-time over a smart health platform at any place and at any time. Therefore, it serves as a tool to notify one's acquaintances of a risk when one faces an emergent situation or is about to be at risk.",

Remote monitoring can reduce the amount of recurring admissions to hospital, facilitate more efficient clinical visits with objective results, and may reduce the length of a hospital stay for individuals who are living at home. Telemonitoring can also be applied on a long-term basis to elderly persons to detect gradual deterioration in their health status, which may imply a reduction in their ability to live independently. Mobility is a good indicator of health status and thus by monitoring mobility, clinicians may assess the health status of elderly persons. This article reviews the architecture of health smart home, wearable, and combination systems for the remote monitoring of the mobility of elderly persons as a mechanism of assessing the health status of elderly persons while in their own living environment.",

The concept of the health smart home emphasizes `aging in place', where residents enjoy a healthy independent life in their own homes as they become older. While energy saving is one of the crucial issues to be addressed in domestic buildings, there is little research into household energy consumption in health smart homes. This paper identifies each variable's implications for health smart home services and highlights its application to energy consumption awareness. We also introduce Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) to simulate energy consumption awareness in health smart homes. Firstly, the research proposes a framework for constructing health smart home services with a focus on the practicability of each variable from the perspective of supporting user experience in home settings. Rather than address each variable in isolation, we consider comprehensive issues in terms of service effectiveness in supporting a healthy life at home. Additionally, the innovative MAR application associated with energy use is presented as a new solution for household energy consumption awareness. The proposed application will be a basis for the perspectives of future research directions on health smart home services.",

abstract="Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application's interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

abstract="Information and computer technology has come to play an increasingly important role in medicine, to the extent that e-health has been described as a disruptive innovation or revolution in healthcare. The attention is very much focused on the technology itself, and advances that have been made in genetics and biology. This leads to the question: What is changing in medicine today concerning e-health? To what degree could these changes be characterized as a `revolution'? We will apply the work of Thomas Kuhn, Larry Laudan, Michel Foucault and other philosophers---which offers an alternative understanding of progress and revolution in medicine to the classic discovery-oriented approach---to our analysis. Nowadays, the long-standing curative or reactive paradigm in medicine is facing a crisis due to an aging population, a significant increase in chronic diseases and the development of more expensive diagnostic tools and therapies. This promotes the evolution towards a new paradigm with an emphasis on preventive medicine. E-health constitutes an essential part of this new paradigm that seeks to solve the challenges presented by an aging population, skyrocketing costs and so forth. Our approach changes the focus from the technology itself toward the underlying paradigm shift in medicine. We will discuss the relevance of this approach by applying it to the surge in digital self-tracking through health apps and wearables: the recognition of the underlying paradigm shift leads to a more comprehensive understanding of self-tracking than a solely discovery-oriented or technology-focused view can provide.",

abstract="Due to the enhancing of life quality, increasing of chronic diseases, changing lifestyles, and an expanding life expectancy, rapid population aging requires a new business model that promotes happiness and emphasizes a healthy body and mind through the ``anytime, anywhere well-being'' lifestyle. Recently, lifecare systems using IoT devices are being released as products that are influential on the overall society, and their effectiveness is continuously proven. In addition, based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, diverse companies are conducting investments and research to develop devices as well as solutions that connect to these devices. Accordingly, in this study, a mining-based lifecare-recommendation method using a peer-to-peer dataset and adaptive decision feedback is proposed. In addition to collecting PHRs, the proposed method measures life-logs such as dietary life, life pattern, sleep pattern, life behavior, and job career; the P2P-dataset preprocessed index information; and biometric information using a wearable device. It uses the Open API to collect the health-weather and life-weather index data from public data, and it uses a smart-band-type wearable device known as a biosensor to measure the heart rate, daily activity, and body temperature. It monitors the current status and conditions through the classification of life data, and it mines big data and uses a decision tree to analyze the association rules and correlations, as well as to discover new knowledge patterns. In the peer-to-peer networking, a lifecare recommendation model that uses adaptive decision feedback has been developed for the peer-to-peer platform. This adaptive decision feedback reflects an individual's importance or sensory level. Accordingly, it proposes more individualized and flexible results and can be configured to support intellectual lifecare. A mining-based lifecare-recommendation mobile service can also be developed to enhance the quality of life, as it provides user-based health management and reduces the medical expenses; accordingly, it enhances the service satisfaction and quality in the lifecare field.",

In fact, its complexity is generated by a large number of entities and actors which cooperate simultaneously with an unpredictable way to understand what customers want and then design product with diverse objectives in mind. A slight change in one activity may cause tremors everywhere. Within a dynamic environment and in order to meet concurrently these challenges, several researchers have implemented design for X (DFX) techniques. Regarding the availability of numerous DFX, the decision as to which one to apply remains absent. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the most prominent DFX techniques with respect to sustainability dimension as well as the cost ownership and product differentiation strategies. In addition to that, complex product necessitates the consideration of integrated DFX to optimize product life cycle from a more holistic perspective. In this respect, the paper addresses a systematic review from 1980 to 2018 by investigating and discussing the past and current research of each DFX techniques as well as for integrated ones. The key problems and issues that future DFX research should address have been identified and discussed in this paper.",

It is an important problem of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and has many applications in HCI, such as assistive living and healthcare. Recognition of users' common behaviors allows an environment to provide personalized service. Unlike activity recognition in computer vision which uses cameras, it studies activities by embedded sensors in smart homes. In this paper, we propose a method to extract latent features from sensor data by Beta Process Hidden Markov Model (BP-HMM). The contributions of our method are twofold: 1, we extend BP-HMM by dependent Beta process, and integrate state constraints of sensors into the sampling process of BP-HMM. 2, we extract latent features automatically by our dependent BP-HMM, and train a structural support vector machine (SVM) by these features in a supervised way for activity recognition. To evaluate the proposed method, we performed experiments on the real-world smart home datasets. Our results suggest that extracting latent features from sensor data leads to good performance for activity recognition.",

abstract="Because on the increase in the number of the elderly living alone and accidents occurring to them, the demand for a monitoring system capable of supporting fast response in case of an emergency situation by monitoring their everyday life in their residential spaces has been increasing. A framework and a system are presented to monitor the emergency situations of the elderly living alone using a low-cost device and open-source software. First, human pose recognition and emergency situations according to the pose change were defined using object recognition, and a procedure capable of detecting such situations was proposed. In addition, a pose recognition model was created using the TensorFlow Object Detection application programming interface (API) of Google to implement the procedure. Using a data preprocessing process and the created model, a system capable of detecting emergency situations and sounding an alarm was implemented. To verify the proposed system, the pose recognition success rate was examined, and an experiment on emergency situation recognition was performed while the angle and distance of the camera were varied in a setup similar to the residential environment. It is expected that the proposed framework for the emergency notification system for the elderly will be utilized for the analysis of various behavior patterns, such as the sudden abnormal behavior of the elderly, people with disabilities, and children.",

abstract="The incorporation of information and communication technologies has transformed the health field. With the constant miniaturization of embedded devices, the increase in human--computer interactions and their ubiquity has increased the possibilities of intervention in this field of study. One of the fundamental characteristics of ubiquitous computing applied to health is context awareness. The use of context awareness in healthcare faces many challenges, which has led to the search for several solutions in the integration of sensors from different origins, in data fusion and reasoning algorithms, among others. This paper aims to explore the recent literature related to the use of context awareness in health, defining the taxonomy and identifying challenges and open questions. The method for achieving these objectives is to use the systematic literature review approach, which is characterized by research questions that guide the definition of a taxonomy and the search for challenges in the area. As a result, we have reviewed around 4000 scientific studies published over the last ten years, selecting and researching the most meaningful, in-depth approaches in the field of context-aware health, resulting in a final corpus of 38 articles. We have developed an up-to-date taxonomy that classifies context awareness in the field of health, as well as identifying open questions and issues that can guide future work in the area. These results, unified in one paper, contribute to a significant degree of coverage of the use of context-aware data in health.",

abstract="Nowadays, thanks to the hardware costs reduction everyone at home owns at least one hi-technology devices to support life quality. This paper proposes a new methodology to analyse the indoor air quality with a cheap and third-age-dedicated device. A new prototype, called Home Pollution Embedded System (HOPES), was developed to give simple and understandable information, also comprehensible for people with cognitive problems or that are not familiar with new technologies. The device gathers pollutants data and displays to the user different air pollutants concentrations, from toxics gasses up to explosives. Moreover, an overall air quality index has been elaborated and is displayed by HOPES with lights and numerical information. HOPES is an Internet of things device that works in real time and that can be connected to the web and to a geographic information system platform to add spatial information of each pollutant. The hardware architecture employs a set of gas semiconductor sensors and an IR particulate matter sensor. Experimental results demonstrated that HOPES has an accurate sensor response and is suitable to be used with the proposed indices. In fact, despite of the poor-selective metal oxide sensors, the results highlighted how it is possible to get useful air quality information with a cheap device. However, the system needs more tests to validate the sensors array with different substances.",

Big-data generated on social media sites have created opportunities for developing evidence-based insights that can be useful for decision-makers. While previous studies have introduced observational data analysis methods for social media data, there remains a need for method development---specifically for capturing people's movement flows and behavioural details. This paper reports a study outlining a new analytical method, to explore people's activities, behavioural, and movement details for people monitoring and planning purposes. Our method utilises online geotagged content uploaded by users from various locations. The effectiveness of the proposed method, which combines content capturing, processing and predicting algorithms, is demonstrated through a case study of the Fiji Islands. The results show good performance compared to other relevant methods and show applicability to national decisions and policies.",

month="Sep",

abstract="Context computing is a branch of ambient intelligence (AmI) research, which has been rapidly emerging in the support of intelligent smart health platform solution. To develop reliable ambient computing using the hybrid peer-to-peer network and Internet of Things, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and context awareness have been applied. This study proposes an ambient context-based modeling for a health risk assessment using deep neural network. In the proposed method, we collected medical information from chronic disease patients such as EMR, PHR, and medical histories, as well as environmental data from a health platform. Subsequently, heterogeneous data are integrated through selecting, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating the collected raw data and then the context is created. The structured input data such as a sensor data are normalized by transforming the time domain data to the frequency domain information. Using a deep neural network, the normalized data are applied to create an ambient context. A deep neural network is composed of the following three layers: input layers with treated and untreated data; hidden layers where connection strength is trained as a weight; and output layers of trained results. In the deep neural network layers, the control of the weight of training data enables repeated learning to create an ambient context pattern. Using an ontology inference engine, unstructured/structured data, including individual health data and environmental information, and their context is presented as ontology metadata. In the knowledge base, hidden association relationships are discovered through mining. To inform the individual health conditions exposed to the individual environmental contexts, a health risk assessment model is developed with a set of the ambient context pattern learned with metadata and a deep neural network. The Minkowski distance formula, which defines a normalized geometrical distance between two nodes, is used to measure the similarity between the patients with chronical disease and the individual user based on the context. In the proposed model, the risk is represented as a similarity-based index. The risk assessment model can be implemented into the individual risk alert/prevention system. The model may significantly impact the healthcare industry as well as ambient intelligence research, thus contributing to improve the quality of human life of the future society.",

abstract="This paper describes the investigation of the development of future technological products to support older people in everyday living through the agency of a community art group. Recent research has identified a number of challenges facing designers seeking to use traditional participatory design approaches to gather technology requirements data from older people. Here, a project is described that sought to get a group of older people to think creatively about their needs and desires for technological support through the medium of paint. The artistic expression technique described in this article allowed the identification of issues that had also been found by previous research that used a range of different techniques. This indicates that the approach shows promise, as it allows information to be gathered in an environment that is comfortable and familiar using methods already known by the participants and which they find enjoyable. It provides a complement (or possible alternative) to standard protocols and has the potential benefit of extracting even richer information as the primary task for participants is enjoyable in its own right and is not associated with an interrogative process. Furthermore, it is argued that some of the key risks of traditional approaches are lessened or removed by the naturalistic setting of this approach.",

abstract="This paper explains why China has developed ambitious policies, targets and projects for sustainable development and has become a promoter of the United Nations Agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Based on analysis of policy documents, interviews and talks with experts, it underpins the relevance of multi-stakeholder contributions and collaborative governance arrangements for China's green transition, challenging the recently emerging criticism on ``orthodox Western environmental discourse'' discussed in this journal. Following an introduction and discussion on the relevance of the SDGs, it engages in an analysis of push and pull factors of China's sustainable development agenda. Driving factors at domestic level tie well into dynamics at international level, for example in the field of China's aspiration for leadership in the field of green technologies. China is combining command-and-control, market-based and awareness raising measures to promote the sustainability transition. The central government draws on experience gathered at the local level in the context of emission trading, low-carbon and smart city development. Next to government agencies, the private sector and many academics as well as nonprofit actors are involved in the process of disseminating and scaling-up good practices. The main challenges of China's sustainability transition consist of balancing economic, social and environmental objectives in a country with huge economic disparities, addressing capacity building at local level and bringing down double-digit rates of curtailment of renewable energies. China's commitment to the sustainability agenda clearly has the potential to raise its image and soft power, in particular if it remains committed to global agreements and contributions from a variety of stakeholders at subnational, national and global level.",

abstract="One of the goals of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions is to extend the time that elderly people can live independently in their preferred environments by using ICT technologies for personal healthcare. However, in order to be optimal, remote monitoring services and health-related interventions should be strongly personalised to specific individuals' requirements, preferences, abilities and motivations, which can vary among the elderly, and even dynamically evolve over time for the same person depending on changing user needs and context-dependent conditions. In this paper we present an End User Development (EUD) tool for the personalisation of context-dependent assistance by non-technical users in the AAL domain. In particular, we have considered applications for remotely monitoring and assisting elderly people at home through sending multimedia messages and reminders, as well as changing the state of various domestic appliances (e.g. lamps, heating system, TV) and devices available in the context surrounding the user. The design and development of the tailoring environment has been carried out in an iterative manner, informed by the feedback that was gathered through empirical evaluations done with older adults and caregivers.",

The focus is on how ubiquitous technologies have been and can be utilised in developing urban infrastructure, including town planning, street and property maintenance, water supply, public transportation and environmental protection. Such an emerging infrastructure is expected to provide everyone with an opportunity to access urban infrastructure and services with the help of ubiquitous technologies. However, in order to become reality, this requires some kind of democratisation of technology, which is a neglected topic in u-city discourse. It is also important to analyse u-city developments from the point of view of production of space with special reference to the potential colonisation of everyday life. Theoretically speaking, one answer to such compelling questions about the rationale of u-city development can be sought from the idea of the `right to the city', a slogan originally coined by Henri Lefebvre. This approach highlights the importance of involving people to envisioning the future of urban form starting from the perspective of their everyday life. Such a dimension should be given more prominent role in current u-city developments.",

Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home---functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home---prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home---hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns---privacy and control---that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified.",

abstract="In this article, we address the implementation and deployment of a service robot platform for interaction with the elderly in the context of a collaborative European initiative. Specifically, we overview the development of the robot system architecture and components, focusing on the graceful integration of a set of interoperable intelligent services towards advanced human--robot interaction. The service robot targets older people with light physical or psychological issues, delivering several different functionalities, and putting itself at their service. We describe the initial validation tests in a semi-controlled scenario, as well as the deployment of the robotic platform during a week-long pilot in an end user environment. The main challenges and the outcome of the experimental tests with the mobile robot platform are discussed, and results show generally positive reactions from the care center residents, which have provided their valuable feedback on the usability, appearance, interaction and satisfaction of the robot, yielding important lessons that were learned while performing the pilot.",

abstract="With the development of big data computing technology, most documents in various areas, including politics, economics, society, culture, life, and public health, have been digitalized. The structure of conventional documents differs according to their authors or the organization that generated them. Therefore, policies and studies related to their efficient digitalization and use exist. Text mining is the technology used to classify, cluster, extract, search, and analyze data to find patterns or features in a set of unstructured or structured documents written in natural language. In this paper, a method for extracting associative feature information using text mining from health big data is proposed. Using health documents as raw data, health big data are created by means of the Web. The useful information contained in health documents is extracted through text mining. Health documents as raw data are collected through Web scraping and then saved in a file server. The collected raw data of health documents are sentence type, and thus morphological analysis is applied to create a corpus. The file server executes stop word removal, tagging, and the analysis of polysemous words in a preprocessing procedure to create a candidate corpus. TF-C-IDF is applied to the candidate corpus to evaluate the importance of words in a set of documents. The words classified as of high importance by TF-C-IDF are included in a set of keywords, and the transactions of each document are created. Using an Apriori mining algorithm, the association rules of keywords in the created transaction are analyzed and associative keywords are generated. TF-C-IDF weights and associative keywords are extracted from health big data as associative features. The proposed method is a base technology for creating added value in the healthcare industry in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. Its evaluation in terms of F-measure and efficiency showed its performance to be high. The method is expected to contribute to healthcare big data management and information search.",

A real-time activity understanding system with accurate human location estimation under varying illumination is required for smart lighting control, since comfortable lighting conditions vary according to human activities. This paper presents a real-time smart lighting control system using human location estimation based on inverse-perspective mapping of depth map images and activity estimation from location, heading direction, and height estimation of the moving person from multiple depth cameras. Lighting control based on estimated proximity to the specific activity area, distance to the target lighting area, and heading direction of the person provides an automatic activity-dependent lighting environment as well as energy savings. We implemented several activity modes such as study mode, dialog mode, and watching TV mode, and applied the proposed lighting control system to a living room lighting control with known furniture, electronics, and lighting locations using multiple Kinect depth cameras. The proposed model is based on localized proximity-based lighting control and can be extended to a more general lighting control by combining with global lighting control schemes.",

The first experimental results led to the finding of the emotional response time dynamics (Navarro-Tuch et al., in: SAI Intelligent Systems Conference. London, pp 567--571, 2016). Such dynamics were important for further design and implementation of the testing methodology for response analysis to alternative stimuli. The final sections of the work present a final experiment in which the stimuli contemplated were the temperature, humidity, light intensity and visual stimuli with the corresponding testing methodology implementation. Which led to the final correlation equations for each of five basic emotions selected.

Different ways of visualizing large sensor data sets and representing them in a format suitable for clustering the abnormalities are also investigated. In the latter part of this paper, recurrent neural networks are used to predict the future values of the activities for each sensor. The predicted values are used to inform the caregiver in case anomalous behaviour is predicted in the near future.

abstract="Selecting ambient media services in a smart home monitoring environment is challenging. Services in such an environment should be ubiquitous, adaptive, and robust with respect to access and delivery. Many different techniques exist for selecting services in smart environments, for example, dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic. However, existing approaches to service selection fail to address the dynamic nature of the services and the requirement of considering the user context and user satisfaction. We address this issue by proposing an ant-inspired service selection framework based on dynamic user preferences and satisfaction. This ant-inspired approach is robust to failures and adaptive to dynamic context. The proposed framework enables different categories of residents (e.g., elderly people, fathers with children, mothers, and so on) to access various media services in such a way that their experiences are optimized with regard to their surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework.",

The results from this study suggest that informants' views were shaped by prior knowledge of conventional health and social care delivery in their locality, and the implication is that expectations and requirements with respect to telecare services in general are likely to be informed by wider perceptions about the extent to which community care should operate as a preventative strategy or as a mechanism for crisis management.",

Moreover, people today are often challenged by overloaded wardrobes and store many clothing items that they never use. In this paper, we describe an Internet of Things system that creates incentives for the users to recycle their clothes, benefiting the environmental sustainability. We propose a content-based recommendation approach that utilizes semantic web technologies and that leverages a set of context signals obtained from the system's architecture, to recommend clothing items that might be relevant for the user to recycle. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms a baseline which does not utilize semantic web technologies.",

abstract="Maintaining functional independence is a high priority for many older adults. Often, staying in their own homes is key to such independence. Computer technology has the potential to assist in this goal by supporting the everyday tasks of older individuals, as well as by aiding caregivers and family members. Our research in advanced computing technologies explores how computational capabilities can enhance day-to-day activities. The computer is not a tool to be picked up, used, and then set aside; it is a constant partner in daily activities. The challenge is to design interfaces that reflect and support ongoing activities of daily life but not be inappropriately intrusive. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the issues that must be considered to ensure success of these development efforts, including older adults' attitudes towards technology as well as their needs and capabilities. We present two illustrative example projects: one designed to meet daily awareness needs of adult children concerned about the well-being of a senior parent, and another that can provide surrogate memory aids for household tasks. These examples demonstrate the complexity of the issues involved in designing the computationally capable home of the future and provide direction for future research and development efforts.",

The eye movement is captured using silver chloride (AgCl) surface electrodes placed around eyes. The captured signal is further processed and transmitted using a VLC link to control smart home devices. To validate the proposed EOG-VLC based smart device control scheme, experiments were conducted. For the ease of the experiments, instead of an actual smart home device, we employed a digital door lock to verify its accurate control operation. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed smart device control scheme operates accurately and reliably. Therefore, since the proposed scheme is based on a less hazardous VLC link, it is envisioned that the scheme can pave the way for greener and safer smart homes, particularly benefiting disabled and elderly people.",

abstract="The decrease in fertility rates and the increase in the average age of individuals are the main reasons behind the aging of the population. Challenges that come with an aging population include proper nursing care. Because the cost of healthcare is high and falls that cause injury or death in the elderly are escalating, they are a challenge for public welfare and research into reliable surveillance is essential. Non-intrusive fall detection systems are vital for reducing fall trauma and machine vision is an appropriate solution for detecting unusual events such as falls. Because there are varieties of vision-based fall detection (VBFD) methods and a comprehensive framework is lacking, comparison and evaluation of existing methods are difficult. In the current study, an analytical framework having three main components is proposed. First, existing VBFD methods are classified into three categories. Next, general evaluation criteria are defined for analysis of the proposed categorizations. Finally, each method is qualitatively analyzed using the proposed categorizations. The proposed framework can accurately provide identification and analytical comparison of existing methods. In addition, it can allow selection of the most appropriate methods and suggest improvements for existing methods.",

abstract="Two primary concerns for our aging society are preserving good health and avoiding disease. A Smart Home system is one efficient and capable way to find the solution of this complex problem. But, there are several reasons which building a Sma6rt Home is complex. First, it is difficult to accurately track the behavior of the elderly in house, because each person has unique needs and behavior. And also, the system cannot know whether a given behavior is normal or not. Second, medical symptoms are very complex. Third, to get the information in the house, there should be various technologies which use different protocols, data, languages and specifications. In order to solve them, this research which is a part of POSTECH U-Health Smart Home project, was started. This paper makes two significant contributions to the Smart Home Project and autonomic system fields. The first contribution is general architecture for the U-Health Smart Home project through Smart Home at POSTECH. The requirements what kinds of parts are needed to build the Smart Home are introduced and proposed in this paper. The second contribution is a semantic model which can be used by an autonomic system to make accurate and intelligent decisions. To create the appropriate model, various semantic technologies, which use OWL as the programming language, Prot{\'e}g{\'e} which version is 3.4.2 as a tool for ontology creation and SWRL as a language for reasoning, were used. Furthermore, for reasonable ontology, open standard CIM version 2.22 is defined and published by DMTF was used as an entire framework.",

The different modalities of IT used in falls prevention at the different places of care for each category were explored and inferences were drawn from the structured themes which summarized the major findings. The research found that there is potential ground for a wider use of the forms of IT used in falls prevention in the elderly in various settings and outlined the factors involved in this usage. With further refinements in larger studies, many of these forms of IT would be better explored and acceptance is likely guaranteed provided they are accessible and affordable. The need for IT use in fall prevention in the elderly is unavoidable with the trend in technology and the associated convenience. More work is needed to further define the effects of IT in falls prevention using larger prospective studies that will be more generalizable.",

abstract="Due to their impressive advantages, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems are ubiquitously found in various novel applications. These applications are usually in need of quick and accurate authentication or identification. In many cases, it has been shown that if such systems are not properly designed, an adversary can cause security and privacy concerns for end-users. In order to deal with these concerns, impressive endeavors have been made which have resulted in various RFID authentications being proposed. In this study, we analyze three lightweight RFID authentication protocols proposed in Wireless Personal Communications (2014), Computers {\&} Security (2015) and Wireless Networks (2016). We show that none of the studied protocols provides the desired security and privacy required by the end-users. We present various security and privacy attacks such as secret parameter reveal, impersonation, DoS, traceability, and forward traceability against the studied protocols. Our attacks are mounted in the Ouafi--Phan RFID formal privacy model which is a modified version of well-known Juels--Weis privacy model.",

The present paper reports results of a short term and a long term evaluation of a small socially assistive humanoid robot in a smart home environment. Eight elderly people tested an integrated smart--home robot system in five real--world scenarios. Six of the participants experienced the system in two sessions over a two week period; the other two participants had a prolonged experience of eight sessions over a three month period. Results showed that the small humanoid robot was trusted by the participants. A cross--cultural comparison showed that results were not due to the cultural background of the participants. The long term evaluation showed that the participants might engage in an emotional relationship with the robot, but that perceived enjoyment might decrease over time.",

abstract="Smart environments help to increase the autonomy and quality of life of people with special needs (PwSN) through adapted assistive services. In conjunction with context awareness and service delivery mechanisms, it is possible to dynamically deliver services to users by taking into account contextual information, e.g., user's locations, devices' states, current activities. However, implementing such systems in actual smart spaces is not trivial. The micro and macro context awareness model helps in defining layers on which contextual information are processed as close as possible from their sources (micro), without losing the benefits of information processing at a systemic level (macro). This paper describes the micro and macro context awareness model and its uses in the implementation of a service provision system for smart environments. Transparency and intelligibility are important factors in context awareness system, which help developers to fully understand the full behavior of the systems and help users to learn how the systems work. We therefore accompanied our micro and macro model with an intelligibility model which allow the generation of explanations describing the system's behaviors according to the processed context. Finally, results coming from the evaluations of the micro/macro model and comparison with related works are presented.",

abstract="Pervasive computing has emerged as a viable solution capable of providing technology-driven assistive living for elderly. The pervasive healthcare system, Context-Aware Real-time Assistant (CARA), is designed to provide personalized healthcare services for elderly in a timely and appropriate manner by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. The work in this paper introduces a personalized, flexible, and extensible hybrid reasoning framework for CARA system in a smart home environment which provides context-aware sensor data fusion as well as anomaly detection mechanisms that supports activity of daily living analysis and alert generation. We study how the incorporation of rule-based and case-based reasoning enables CARA to become more robust and to adapt to a changing environment by continuously retraining with new cases. Noteworthy about the work is the use of case-based reasoning to detect conditional anomalies for home automation, and the use of hierarchical fuzzy rule-based reasoning to deal with exceptions and to achieve query-sensitive case retrieval and case adaptation. Case study for evaluation of this hybrid reasoning framework is carried out under simulated but realistic smart home scenarios. The results indicate the feasibility of the framework for effective at-home monitoring.",

journal="Knowledge and Information Systems",

month="Mar",
day="26",
abstract="The miniaturization of sensors and their integration in everyday appliances have opened the way for ecologically monitoring people's behavior based on their interaction with smart objects. Thanks to behavior monitoring, mobile, and ubiquitous information systems in the areas of e-health, home automation, and smart cities are becoming more and more ``smart,'' being able to dynamically adapt themselves to the current users' context and situation. However, human behavior is characterized by large variability due to individual habits, physical disabilities or cognitive impairment. This aspect makes behavior monitoring a challenging task. On the one side, execution variability makes it hard to acquire sufficiently large activity datasets needed by supervised learning methods. On the other side, being based on a strict definition of activities in terms of constituting simpler actions, existing knowledge-based frameworks fall short in adapting to the specific characteristics of the subject. Hence, the variability of activity execution by different subjects calls for personalized methods to capture human activities and interaction in smart spaces at a fine-grained level. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel hybrid reasoning framework to capture fine-grained interaction with smart objects considering the specific features of individuals. Our model has its roots in the well-founded psychological theory of affordances, i.e., those features of an object that naturally explain its possible uses and how it should be used. The core of the framework is the ontological model of smart objects affordance, expressed through the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language. Through a use case in pervasive healthcare, we show how our framework can be applied to personalized recognition of abnormal behaviors. In particular, we tackle a particularly challenging issue: how to recognize early behavioral symptoms of mild cognitive impairment in subjects with physical disabilities. Moreover, an extensive experimental evaluation with real-world datasets acquired from 24 subjects shows the effectiveness of our framework in recognizing human activities and fine-grained manipulative gestures in different pervasive computing environments.",

The complexity of IEs, whose technologies range from sensors to machine learning, from distributed architectures to tangible interfaces, from communication protocols to data analysis, challenges researchers from various fields to contribute innovative and effective solutions. In this quest for technical solutions to the myriad requirements of an IEs, user expectations are often left behind, and while researchers tend to focus on niche technical aspects, they risk of losing the big picture of an IE ``helping users in their daily life''. This paper analyzes the recent literature of the IEs' research community, aiming at highlighting to which extent users are taken into account, or are involved, into the reported research works. Evidence shows that, while most papers refer to users in their description, only a small minority actually involve them in the design, testing or experimentation phases.",

abstract="The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where High-Performance Computing solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. However, these systems are either memoryless or computational inefficient. Therefore, keeping in view the aforementioned needs, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that enhances the working of traditional MapReduce by incorporating parallel processing algorithm. Moreover, complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed parallel processing algorithm. The proposed system architecture both read and writes operations that enhance the efficiency of the Input/Output operation. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce. MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes to generate and process graphs with near real-time. Moreover, the system is evaluated in terms of efficiency by considering the system throughput and processing time. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient.",

abstract="This paper describes insights from an ethnographic study aimed at understanding the uses and meanings of objects and domestic spaces in the daily practices of older adults. This work was inspired from the awareness that designing suitable domestic technologies which ``fit'' into seniors' home environments requires a deep understanding of how elders arrange and give meanings to their domestic spaces and objects. The final goal of this research is to provide insights into the ways older people make sense of products and services in relation to their individual and social well-being at home. Further studies will address applicative implications regarding how to use these insights to design as innovative and as effective products and services. This research involved two hundred and forty-one participants aged over 65 in Italy from different household situations (living alone, with others, in the family home) and in different social contexts (in rural and large urban areas). In-field observations were carried out at homes of the elderly, and data were collected through narrative interviews, home tours (audio and video recorded), photographs of objects and environments and ethnographic field notes. Results showed that several elements at home become a choreography of ``fondness objects'' which support the remembrance (e.g. mementos) and keep the elderly company (e.g. TV and radio). These objects are often related to meaningful personal memories from past experiences and are ``traces'' of relationships which are no longer physically present were relevant in some periods of life. Ethnographic data return a clear picture of the elderly like people that actively organize their world starting from their strong need of relationships and selective remembering that supports their emotional lives. Implications and suggestions for designers are also discussed.",

This paper presents a way to model and simulate the progression of dementia of the Alzheimer's type by evaluating performance in the execution of an activity of daily living (ADL). This model satisfies three objectives: first, it models an activity of daily living; second, it simulates the progression of the dementia and the errors potentially made by people suffering from it, and, finally, it simulates the support needed by the impaired person. To develop this model, we chose the ACT-R cognitive architecture, which uses symbolic and subsymbolic representations. The simulated results of 100 people suffering from Alzheimer's disease closely resemble the results obtained by 106 people on an occupational assessment (the Kitchen Task Assessment).",

These solutions can also play an important part in intelligent environments, facilitating real-time data collection and input to enable various functionalities. However, there are several challenges regarding the development of mHealth solutions: the most important of these being privacy and data security. Furthermore, the use of cloud computing is becoming an option for the healthcare sector to store healthcare data; but storing data in the cloud raises serious concerns. This paper investigates how data are managed both on mHealth devices as well as in the cloud. Firstly, a detailed analysis of the entire mHealth domain is undertaken to determine domain-specific features and a taxonomy for mHealth, from which a set of security requirements are identified in order to develop a new information security framework. It then examines individual information security frameworks for mHealth devices and the cloud, noting similarities and differences. Furthermore, key mechanisms to implement the new framework are discussed and the new framework is then presented. Finally, the paper presents how the new framework could be implemented in order to develop an Advanced Digital Medical Platform.",

abstract="Individuals with disabilities and seniors often lack the freedom to choose with whom they live and where they reside. Service options may involve moving consumers to large nursing facilities or other less-preferred settings rather than optimizing environmental supports in their own home or in less restrictive settings. Not only do adults usually enjoy greater choice when they live in their own homes relative to individuals living in congregate care or group home settings but independent and semi-independent settings are also associated with better outcomes and lower costs. Identifying variables that serve as barriers to independent living is especially important given estimates predicting that the numbers of seniors and individuals with disabilities will double in the next 20 years. This doubling will tax an already burdened and costly system of care. The present study queried consumers and other key stakeholders about potential barriers to independent living and their importance. Findings not only revealed a high degree of overlap between identified barriers and their importance ratings within groups but also showed clear differences in potential barriers across the groups assessed (individuals with disabilities and senior citizens).",

abstract="Voice command in multi-room smart homes for assisting people in loss of autonomy in their daily activities faces several challenges, one of them being the distant condition which impacts ASR performance. This paper presents an overview of multiple techniques for fusion of multi-source audio (pre, middle, post fusion) for automatic speech recognition for in-home voice command. The robustness of the models of speech is obtained by adaptation to the environment and to the task. Experiments are based on several publicly available realistic datasets with participants enacting activities of daily life. The corpora were recorded in natural condition, meaning background noise is sporadic, so there is no extensive background noise in the data. The smart home is equipped with one or two microphones in each room, the distance between them being larger than 1 m. An evaluation of the most suited techniques improves voice command recognition at the decoding level, by using multiple sources and model adaptation. Although Word Error Rate (WER) is between 26 and 40{\%}, Domotic Error Rate (identical to the WER, but at the level of the voice command) is less than 5.8{\%} for deep neural network models, the method using Feature space Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (fMLLR) with speaker adaptation training and Subspace Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM) exhibits comparable results.",

Because of the specific constraints of WSAN, some limitations can be observed in centralized approaches. Multi-hop communication used by WSAN introduces transmission latency, packet errors, router congestion and security issues. As it uses local services, a model of decentralized services avoids long path communications between nodes and applications. But the two main issues are then to design (1) the composition of such services and to map (2) them over the WSAN. This contribution proposes a model for decentralized services based on Resource Oriented Architecture in which their communications are designed thanks to an adaptation of Petri Network (1).In addition, the problem of decentralized service mapping and its deployment over a WSAN is successfully resumed by a Pseudo-Boolean Optimization in order to minimize network communication load (2).

abstract="Nowadays, systems are growing in power and in access to more resources and services. This situation makes it necessary to provide user-centered systems that act as intelligent assistants. These systems should be able to interact in a natural way with human users and the environment and also be able to take into account user goals and environment information and changes. In this paper, we present an architecture for the design and development of a goal-oriented, self-adaptive, smart-home environment. With this architecture, users are able to interact with the system by expressing their goals which are translated into a set of agent actions in a way that is transparent to the user. This is especially appropriate for environments where ambient intelligence and automatic control are integrated for the user's welfare. In order to validate this proposal, we designed a prototype based on the proposed architecture for smart-home scenarios. We also performed a set of experiments that shows how the proposed architecture for human-agent interaction increases the number and quality of user goals achieved.",

abstract="With the growing proportion of dependant people (ageing, disabled users), Tele-assistance and Tele-monitoring platforms will play a significant role to deliver an efficient and less-costly remote care in their assistive living environments. Sensor based technology would greatly contribute to get valuable information which should help to provide personalized access to the services available within their living spaces. However, current access control models remain unsuitable due to the lack of completeness, flexibility and adaptability to the user profile. In this paper, we propose a new access control model based on the user capabilities and behavior. This model is evaluated using the data sensed from our tele-monitoring platform in order to assist automatically the dependent people according to the occurred situation. The design of our model is a dynamic ontology and evolving security policy according to the access rules that are used in the inference engine to provide the right service according to the user's needs. Our security policy reacts according to the detected distress situation derived from the data combination of both the wearable devices and the pervasive sensors. The security policy is managed through the classification and reasoning process. Our classification process aims to extract the behavior patterns which are obtained by mining the data set issued from our Tele-monitoring platform according to the discriminating attributes: fall, posture, movement, time, user presence, pulse and emergency call. Our reasoning process aims to explore the recognized context and the extracted behavior patterns which set up the rule engine to infer the right decision security policy.",

abstract="The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and `silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies have received increased attention from government, industry and research. Informal caregivers will be directly affected by the use of these technologies and are likely to be key influencers in the adoption decision of older adults. However, so far the informal caregivers' perceptions, concerns and needs have been mostly overlooked in AAL research. To address these shortcomings, two studies were conducted. Study I consisted of 20 in-depth interviews with informal caregivers to investigate their perception of various AAL applications. In Study II these findings were validated with regard to our own prototype application called SONOPA. The second study included couples of informal caregivers and care receivers to compare both user groups. Although informal caregivers had a more positive attitude than care receivers and appreciated the opportunities of AAL technologies (e.g., increased safety, peace of mind); they also had several concern such as invading the care receiver's privacy, the lack of human touch, and the care receiver's technology experience. To address these concerns, informal caregivers should be more involved when developing AAL applications.",

abstract="Robotic ecologies are networks of heterogeneous robotic devices pervasively embedded in everyday environments, where they cooperate to perform complex tasks. While their potential makes them increasingly popular, one fundamental problem is how to make them both autonomous and adaptive, so as to reduce the amount of preparation, pre-programming and human supervision that they require in real world applications. The project RUBICON develops learning solutions which yield cheaper, adaptive and efficient coordination of robotic ecologies. The approach we pursue builds upon a unique combination of methods from cognitive robotics, machine learning, planning and agent-based control, and wireless sensor networks. This paper illustrates the innovations advanced by RUBICON in each of these fronts before describing how the resulting techniques have been integrated and applied to a proof of concept smart home scenario. The resulting system is able to provide useful services and pro-actively assist the users in their activities. RUBICON learns through an incremental and progressive approach driven by the feedback received from its own activities and from the user, while also self-organizing the manner in which it uses available sensors, actuators and other functional components in the process. This paper summarises some of the lessons learned by adopting such an approach and outlines promising directions for future work.",

First, a number of smart technology applications were analyzed, from which the smart technologies suitable for improving a specific life quality were found out. To a person in a mobile environment, awareness, comfort, efficiency, immediacy, mobility, preparedness, and responsiveness were considered as more important types of the life quality. To improve these, the most effective smart technologies were concluded as smart mobile services, smart phone, smart glasses/spectacles/contact lens, and smart surveillance camera. The contribution of this study includes a systematic procedure for applying smart technologies to improving the life quality of a mobile person, and a novel method that involves applying the Kano quality model to quantify life quality from several innovative viewpoints.

abstract="Activity recognition is beneficial for continuous health monitoring of smart-home residents, such as patients and elderly people, living in the privacy of their home. We propose an activity recognition approach apposite for a smart home environment. The observations are obtained through multiple sensors deployed at different locations within a smart home. The activities are represented by the features selected from the received observations. The inconsistent order of performing the activities, infrequent occurrences and the presence of overlapping activities make it challenging to select the features with high class representative ability and inter-class discriminative qualities. We select the key features locally within each activity class, which is least affected by the order of performance and the occurrence of other activities. Next, for association of activities, we solve the existing multi-class problem through a specifically designed binary classification with ranking solution, which learns on the correct and incorrect assignments of activities. A comparison of proposed approach with existing methods in terms of recognition accuracy is presented on publicly available `Kasteren' and `CASAS' datasets, representing a range of overlapping and well separated activities of daily life. Our approach tailored towards a smart home environment demonstrates a better accuracy than existing methods.",

The objective of this design approach is to facilitate inter-disciplinary collaborations, which are essential for HRI research and for developing successful products. The proposed design approach was used in the design of the healthcare service robot ``Cafero'' developed at the University of Auckland in collaboration with the Electronic and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI) and Yujin Robot Company Ltd. of Korea.

abstract="The growing worldwide population has increased the need for technologies, computerised software algorithms and smart devices that can monitor and assist patients anytime and anywhere and thus enable them to lead independent lives. The real-time remote monitoring of patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves when patients are considered `big data'. To our knowledge, no study has highlighted the link between `big data' characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the six `Vs': volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability. Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and real-time remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised. (3) As a recommended solution, decision making using multiple criteria, such as vital signs and chief complaints, is utilised to prioritise the big data of patients with chronic diseases on the basis of the most urgent cases.",

abstract="It is well known that smart thermostats (STs) have become key devices in the implementation of smart homes; thus, they are considered as primary elements for the control of electrical energy consumption in households. Moreover, energy consumption is drastically affected when the end users select unsuitable STs or when they do not use the STs correctly. Furthermore, in future, Mexico will face serious electrical energy challenges that can be considerably resolved if the end users operate the STs in a correct manner. Hence, it is important to carry out an in-depth study and analysis on thermostats, by focusing on social aspects that influence the technological use and performance of the thermostats. This paper proposes the use of a signal detection theory (SDT), fuzzy detection theory (FDT), and chi-square (CS) test in order to understand the perceptions and beliefs of end users about the use of STs in Mexico. This paper extensively shows the perceptions and beliefs about the selected thermostats in Mexico. Besides, it presents an in-depth discussion on the cognitive perceptions and beliefs of end users. Moreover, it shows why the expectations of the end users about STs are not met. It also promotes the technological and social development of STs such that they are relatively more accepted in complex electrical grids such as smart grids.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel Evolutionary Ensembles Model (EEM) that values both minor and major activities by processing each of them independently. It is based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to handle the non-deterministic nature of activities. Our evolutionary ensemble learner generates a human-understandable rule profile to ensure a certain level of confidence for performed activities. To evaluate the EEM, we performed experiments on three different real world datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement of 0.6 {\%} to 0.28 {\%} in the F-measures of recognized activities compared to existing counterparts. It is expected that EEM would be a practical solution for the activity recognition problem due to its understandable output and improved accuracy.",

abstract="Nowadays, great attention is paid to studies on fusion health and medical care combined of IT and BT for chronic disease patients due to westernization of dietary life, increase in stress, decrease in physical activities, and others. In reality, full recovery of chronic disease is difficult to achieve as its cause is diverse and complex. Therefore, the necessity for continuous management is proposed rather than approach to treat the disease. It is urgent to come up with the countermeasure since the lengthening of life expectancy in the aging society brings about the increase in chronic diseases and such increased medical expense becomes a big burden in socioeconomic activities. Companies are promoting test-projects in association with health management together with nationwide health management business for chronic diseases. In this study, we proposed the emergency situation monitoring service using context motion tracking for chronic disease patients. Proposed service diagnoses current status of patient based on contextual information collected and it provides information necessary for chronic disease management by analyzing life habits. Bio status recognition can provide proper service through the extraction of contextual data relevant to chronic disease patients. The context motion tracking provides emergency situation monitoring service accordingly with alert and symptom level in case of detecting symptoms through measured results and analysis. Semantic inference engine for context awareness conducts active and intelligent analysis on health condition and life patterns. Since it can properly correspond to extraordinary circumstances, it provides necessary service environment for emergency situation or symptoms. The cameras, speakers, and sensors are installed accordingly with the structure of indoor living space of user and the contextual information is transmitted from them. Considering the user convenience, motion history image is used for the motion recognition and continuous tracking from video. The system detects the patterns of expertise based on life pattern and psychological state through life log based motion detection and provides the service accordingly. It provides health related information and emergency situation monitoring service to user at anytime and anywhere and it is easy to use with simple handling. As a result, this system has the advantage of being able to detect emergency situations realistically and intuitively.",

abstract="Technologies are being developed and promoted with the aim of improving the health and quality of life of older adults, but often without analyzing or planning around the human needs of users. Abraham Maslow's model of the hierarchy of needs proposes that people seek to satisfy progressively higher human needs, starting with physical needs like food and shelter, and advancing through safety and security, belonging and love, esteem, and self-actualization. Each of these levels of need has relevance for aging-related technologies. Lack of attention to user needs may be one factor that explains the limited adoption of many aging-related technologies. It is important to consider the users' current levels of need, the different needs of patients and caregivers, the degrees of behavioral change expected at different levels of need, and the unintended consequences of technologies. Insights from Maslow's model can help developers, researchers, providers, and consumers in the process of producing, evaluating, recommending, and purchasing technologies for older adults. One particular challenge is that assistive technologies may undermine esteem needs by limiting independence. Scales to measure levels of need can help characterize which needs are most relevant for different individuals, and can be used to ensure that technologies address users' needs.",

The activity recognition algorithm utilises two models, one for location estimation and another for activity estimation in the given location. They both give correct recognition for 96 and 94{\%} of the time.",

abstract="Activity  recognition in smart environments is an evolving research problem due to the advancement and proliferation of sensing, monitoring and actuation technologies to make it possible for large scale and real deployment. While activities in smart home are interleaved, complex and volatile; the number of inhabitants in the environment is also dynamic. A key challenge in designing robust smart home activity recognition approaches is to exploit the users' spatiotemporal behavior and location, focus on the availability of multitude of devices capable of providing different dimensions of information and fulfill the underpinning needs for scaling the system beyond a single user or a home environment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for recognizing complex activities of daily living (ADL), that lie in between the two extremes of intensive use of body-worn sensors and the use of ambient sensors. Our approach harnesses the power of simple ambient sensors (e.g., motion sensors) to provide additional `hidden' context (e.g., room-level location) of an individual, and then combines this context with smartphone-based sensing of micro-level postural/locomotive states. The major novelty is our focus on multi-inhabitant environments, where we show how the use of spatiotemporal constraints along with multitude of data sources can be used to significantly improve the accuracy and computational overhead of traditional activity recognition based approaches such as coupled-hidden Markov models. Experimental results on two separate smart home datasets demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of complex ADL classification by over 30 {\%}, compared to pure smartphone-based solutions.",

abstract="During last decade, smart homes in which the activities of the residents are monitored automatically have been developed and demonstrated. However, smart homes with multiple residents still remains an open challenge. In order to tackle the multiple resident concurrent activity recognition problem in smart homes equipped with interaction-based sensors and with multiple residents, we propose two different approaches. In the first approach, we use a factorial hidden Markov model for modeling two separate chains corresponding to two residents. Secondly, we use nonlinear Bayesian tracking for decomposing the observation space into the number of residents. As opposed to the previous studies, we handle multiple residents at the same time without assuming any explicit identification mechanisms. We perform two experiments on real-world multi-resident Activity Recognition with Ambient Sensing data sets. In each experiment, we compare the proposed approach with a counterpart method. We also compare each approach with the manually separated observation performances. We show that both of the proposed methods consistently outperform their counterparts in both houses of the data sets and for both residents. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of run time complexity, flexibility and generalizability.",

abstract="With the advancement of interface technologies in smart devices, voice-controlled assistants have quickly gained popularity. These assistants are designed to use voice commands to achieve a more human-friendly interaction. On these lines, we propose a cloud-connected voice based home assistant in this paper. It accepts voice commands to control or monitor devices in a home. It can understand and schedule device operations based on time or sensor data through a simple voice based approach. To enhance its capability, it is designed to identify the speakers. Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) in combination with other speech features are used as feature vector. We use Vector Quantization (VQ) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of the feature vector, followed by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for classification. The validation of the short speech speaker identification is carried out on a set of Indian speakers in an uncontrolled indoor environment. An accuracy greater than 92{\%} is achieved for speech samples as small as 1 second. A database of more than 50 different commands per speaker is also created for validation of the proposed virtual assistant. IBM's Bluemix and Google's cloud service is used for speech to text conversion.",

abstract="In big data applications, an important factor that may affect the value of the acquired data is the missing data, which arises when data is lost either during acquisition or during storage. The former can be a result of faulty acquisition devices or non responsive sensors whereas the latter can occur as a result of hardware failures at the storage units. In this paper, we consider human activity recognition as a case study of a typical machine learning application on big datasets. We conduct a comprehensive feasibility study on the fusion of sensory data that is acquired from heterogeneous sources. We present insights on the aggregation of heterogeneous datasets with minimal missing data values for future use. Our experiments on the accuracy, F-1 score, and PPV of various key machine learning algorithms show that sensory data acquired by wearables are less vulnerable to missing data and smaller training sets whereas smart portable devices require larger training sets to reduce the impacts of possibly missing data.",

Studies have shown that office workers perform certain jobs better and joggers run longer distances when listening to music. However, a personalized music system which can automatically recommend songs according to user's physiological response remains absent. Therefore, this study aims to establish an intelligent music selection system for individual users to enhance their learning performance. We first created an emotional music database using data analytics classifications. During testing, innovative wearable sensing devices were used to detect heart rate variability (HRV) in experiments, which subsequently guided music selection. User emotions were then analyzed and appropriate songs were selected by using the proposed application software (App). Machine learning was used to record user preference, ensuring accurate and precise classification. Significant results generated through experimental validation indicate that this system generates high satisfaction levels, does not increase mental workload, and improves users' performance. Under the trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the continuing development of wearable devices, the proposed system could stimulate innovative applications for smart factory, home, and health care.",

abstract="In an era of many diseases and increased longevity, more attention has been paid to chronic diseases that require constant health care. Under this circumstance, the development of research and development (R{\&}D) for smart-device-based constant health care has drawn great attention. With the emergence of wearable devices, personal health devices (PHDs), and smartphones, various contents for constant health care have been developed. By using these devices, the users are able to collect personal health records (PHRs) that include data such as activity amount, heart rate, stress, and blood sugar. The range of the collected PHRs can be limited depending on the equipment or the surrounding environment. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to make a comparison with similar users in a cluster. Also, it is necessary to provide a service that can analyze and visually display the collected personal-health information. In this paper, we propose the mining of health-risk factors using the PHR similarity in a hybrid P2P network. This is a method of predicting a user's health status using similarity-based data mining, where the PHRs are employed in a hybrid P2P environment consisting of a peer, a server, and a gateway. In a hybrid P2P environment, a user receives feedback on the result of a structured-data analysis. A peer searches for a different peer and gateway through a server and exchanges information. Depending on the data type, the PHR is divided into medical health examination, self-diagnosis, and personal-health data. The medical health examination contains the personal-health data that are generated regularly by a medical institution. Self-diagnosis represents the data of mental health, pains, and fatigue that can be changed often but cannot be collected by devices. Personal-health data mean the data that can be collected by individuals in everyday life. For the PHR-data analysis, an index is given to each attribute, and preprocessing is performed after a binary-code conversion. To predict a user's health status, the PHR data are clustered on the basis of similarity in a hybrid P2P environment. The similarity between a user's PHR and a PHR that is searched for in the network is measured. After the measurement, an index is given to the PHR that meets the minimum similarity and the PHR is incorporated into a Similarity PHR Group. The Similarity PHR Group flexibly changes depending on a user's PHR status and the statuses of the users who have accessed the hybrid P2P network. A representative value of the Similarity PHR Group is extracted and is then compared with the user's PHR to judge the user's health status. The proposed method is suitable for a smart health service for chronic diseases requiring constant care, elderly health, and aftercare. This is a user-oriented health-care and promotion service wherein a user's health status can be predicted through the mining of the health-risk factors of PHRs.",

Although the points-of-care has more attractive advantages compared with traditional health care systems, some important issues still require a serious consideration such as privacy protection and the security of the transmitted biomedical signals. In this study, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement mechanism that ensures privacy preservation and provides biomedical signals protection during the communication process by negotiating a shared key to encrypt/decrypt sensitive information. Chaotic maps are employed in our design to achieve mutual authentication and key agreement for resource-constrained points-of-care, which also increases the efficiency in comparison with those schemes designed by Elliptic Curve Cryptography or RSA. Furthermore, dynamic identities are adopted in the proposed scheme to achieve user anonymity and user untraceability for the high-privacy-required points-of-care. The security of the proposed scheme is proven via Real-or-Random model. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme reduces computational overhead in comparison with the state-of-the-art schemes.",

The Future Care Lab was not only used as a platform for technically testing the monitoring system, but also more concretely demonstrating to users the integration of these new medical technologies in a home.

In order to provide automatic assistance for the smart home resident through the embedded electronically controllable actuators and make the smart home resident able to live independently at home we propose to calculate a possibilistic logical space for correct realization of activities, which may be represented in form of a multivariable problem. Regardless from the physical entity (modality and location) of the intelligence source and the quantity of individuals who perform the activities; per each possible goal or activity, we consider a unique source of intelligence (for example a social mind) who directs the order of fuzzy events that occur in the ambient environment, then the plan behind world actuations is modeled applying extensions of the fuzzy logic. The main key point that we deal with is the analysis of the observations in order to make inferences about possible simultaneous activities that may be planned and realized by one or more individuals; so that we can reason in the cases the parallel activities are interrupted.",

abstract="In recent years, wireless medical sensor networks meet the web to enable exciting healthcare applications that require data communication over the Internet. Often these applications suffer from data disclosure due to malicious users' activities. To prevent such data disclosure in the healthcare systems, many public key cryptographic techniques have been used. However, most of them are too expensive to implement in the web-enabled wireless medical sensor networks. In 2013, Xun et al. introduced a lightweight encryption algorithm to protect communication between the sensor node and the data servers. Their scheme is based on the Sharemind framework. However, Sharemind framework has a limitation on the number of data storage servers (ie., three servers only). In addition, Xun et al's scheme does not support privacy-preserving patient data analysis for distributed databases of different hospitals. In this paper, we introduce a new practical approach to prevent data disclosure from inside attack. Our new proposal is based on FairplayMP framework which enables programmers who are not experts in the theory of secure computation to implement such protocols. In addition, it support any number of n participants and is suitable for distributed environments. Moreover, in our new scheme, each sensor node needs only one secret key stored in advance to communicate with n different data servers, whereas three secret keys are embedded in advance into each sensor in order to communicate with three data servers in Xun et al's scheme.",

abstract="Mobile workflow execution is gaining importance as traditional process execution systems are employed in many new scenarios such as mobile networks or the Internet of Things. Unfortunately, in these solutions, security is still based on control loops or computer science techniques which have not evolved as fast as current mobile systems and applications. In this context, in order to improve the security level of these systems, it is necessary to create a security framework tightly coupled with the mobile workflow execution platforms. To contribute filling this gap, we propose a framework to inject security controls in workflows, which supports mobile execution and allows a flexible decision making. This solution models security as control points where some relevant previously defined indicators are evaluated. Depending on the obtained values, the framework takes corrective, preventive or adaptive actions, considering also the execution system capabilities and the workflow being executed. In order to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed solution we include experimental validation.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a mobile cloud-based health promotion system targeting clinical cardiovascular diseases for use with both the Windows and Android operating systems. The prototype system can provide health promotion recommendations by physicians via so-called mobile cloud-based health promotion. These recommendations are based on users' own the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), pulse, sleep time, electrocardiogram (ECG), climate, diet, and movement records, utilizing remote video conferences, and asynchronous messaging with users. More specifically, the system integrates cloud-based BP and ECG healthcare module, a remote video technique, a video recording module, a message module, and a cloud-based climate, diet, and movement module. Furthermore, it includes a cloud-based cardiovascular disease electronic bookshelf module to provide healthcare education, as well as a cloud-based health promotion module, which utilizes physicians' preventive health recommendations. We demonstrate the use of this system for cloud-based health promotion and healthcare procedures for cardiovascular diseases. The system integrated BP and ECG machines, which obtain data on systolic and diastolic BP, pulse, sleep time, and ECG signals, utilize a universal serial bus connection to send these vital signs to a computer, laptop, tablet, or smart phone, from which they are transferred to a health promotion center using Wi-Fi, or third and fourth generations mobile communication technologies. This mobile health promotion system can be used in the self-management of various chronic and cardiovascular diseases, anywhere and anytime. The aims of this system are to improve costs, time, efficiency, health management and monitoring, and quality of care.",

abstract="In modern society, interest in health is increasing and the development of medical devices and wireless communication enabled people to get healthcare services easily anytime and anywhere, i.e. ubiquitous healthcare. The development of IT convergence and network technology enabled users to obtain user-centered useful information easily through portable mobile devices as well as computers. Currently, healthcare related user-centered healthcare contents are being actively served and demand related to disease prevention or health promotion is steadily increasing. This paper proposes PHR-based life health index mobile services using a decision support model. A decision support model is developed by using health index related data of existing health weather index service and national health and nutrition survey provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and applications of the mobile environment are developed so that users can receive healthcare services easily anytime and anywhere. The developed mobile service application implemented its interface for the user's convenient healthcare and was developed to enable interlocking with the user's PHR information through web server. Unlike comprehensive and standardized index services of existing KMA health weather index and life health index service, the developed mobile service is serving the user's health status in three stages of danger, alert, safety by using personalized PHR information. The development of the PHR-based life health index mobile service using the decision making model allowed users to check current health status index and obesity measurement, body mass index (BMI), abdominal obesity, potential obesity risk index etc. easily anytime and anywhere only with simple input in the interface of mobile application. Also, accurate and subdivided services can be offered to users and more personalized services enable users to use efficient healthcare service.",

abstract="The term sustainable city is semantically multi-faceted, encompassing or affiliated with numerous other, sometimes conflicting, conceptual designations. Aiming to balance economic development, high quality of life, and environmental protection, the path towards sustainable development has changed over time, new terms have been created and the meaning of familiar terms has changed. In addition, public media play an important role in forming opinions and constituting conceptual knowledge. On this account, changing terms, meanings, and influences have to be regarded carefully. This paper seeks to illuminate changes of meaning by differentiating and comparing various terminologies related to urban sustainability with regard to changing influences. It studies discourse related to sustainable city in newspapers during the sample period 1992--2013 and focuses on designations of urban sustainability that have appeared in the media in Germany---the country of the Energiewende (energy transition)---during the last two decades. The key findings concern changes in the use and the creation of terms and also changes of their meanings. The European city for instance has long been one of the additionally created terms in Germany, but its meaning in the media has shifted from lending geographical specificity to being synonymous with sustainable city in general. Despite the fact that urban sustainability suggests a specific regional scale, German national media create the impression that there is a limited set of concepts nowadays. This evokes an apparent consensus on a national level compared to the former (regional) diversity of terms and meanings. In this paper, the conceptualization that has been most influential recently in the German discourse, namely innovative or smart city, will furthermore be outlined. A possible reason for the strong emergence of these concepts in national discourses on urban sustainability is evaluated.",

abstract="The development of wireless body area sensor networks is imperative for modern telemedicine. However, attackers and cybercriminals are gradually becoming aware in attacking telemedicine systems, and the black market value of protected health information has the highest price nowadays. Security remains a formidable challenge to be resolved. Intelligent home environments make up one of the major application areas of pervasive computing. Security and privacy are the two most important issues in the remote monitoring and control of intelligent home environments for clients and servers in telemedicine architecture. The personal authentication approach that uses the finger vein pattern is a newly investigated biometric technique. This type of biometric has many advantages over other types (explained in detail later on) and is suitable for different human categories and ages. This study aims to establish a secure verification method for real-time monitoring systems to be used for the authentication of patients and other members who are working in telemedicine systems. The process begins with the sensor based on Tiers 1 and 2 (client side) in the telemedicine architecture and ends with patient verification in Tier 3 (server side) via finger vein biometric technology to ensure patient security on both sides. Multilayer taxonomy is conducted in this research to attain the study's goal. In the first layer, real-time remote monitoring studies based on the sensor technology used in telemedicine applications are reviewed and analysed to provide researchers a clear vision of security and privacy based on sensors in telemedicine. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that deal with security and privacy issues, related applications are reviewed comprehensively and a coherent taxonomy of these articles is established. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases are checked for articles on mHealth in telemedicine based on sensors. A total of 3064 papers are collected from 2007 to 2017. The retrieved articles are filtered according to the security and privacy of telemedicine applications based on sensors. Nineteen articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 57.89{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}11/19), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, accounting for 42.1{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}8/19), includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. The collected studies reveal the essential need to construct another taxonomy layer and review studies on finger vein biometric verification systems. This map-matching for both taxonomies is developed for this study to go deeply into the sensor field and determine novel risks and benefits for patient security and privacy on client and server sides in telemedicine applications. In the second layer of our taxonomy, the literature on finger vein biometric verification systems is analysed and reviewed. In this layer, we obtain a final set of 65 articles classified into four categories. In the first category, 80{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}52/65) of the articles focus on development and design. In the second category, 12.30{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}8/65) includes evaluation and comparative articles. These articles are not intensively included in our literature analysis. In the third category, 4.61{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3/65) includes articles about analytical studies. In the fourth category, 3.07{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2/65) comprises reviews and surveys. This study aims to provide researchers with an up-to-date overview of studies that have been conducted on (user/patient) authentication to enhance the security level in telemedicine or any information system. In the current study, taxonomy is presented by explaining previous studies. Moreover, this review highlights the motivations, challenges and recommendations related to finger vein biometric verification systems and determines the gaps in this research direction (protection of finger vein templates in real time), which represent a new research direction in this area.",

abstract="Social robots are being developed to support care given to older adults (OA), people with dementia (PWD) and OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by facilitating their independence and well-being. The successful deployment of robots should be guided by knowledge of factors which affect acceptability. This paper critically reviews empirical studies which have explored how acceptability issues impact OA, PWD and OA with MCI. The aim is to identify the factors governing acceptability, to ascertain what is likely to improve acceptability and make recommendations for future research. A search of the literature published between 2005 and 2015 revealed a relatively small body of relevant work has been conducted focusing on the acceptability of robots by PWD or OA with MCI (n {\$}{\$}={\$}{\$}= 21), and on acceptability for OA (n {\$}{\$}={\$}{\$}= 23). The findings are presented using constructs from the Almere robot acceptance model. They reveal acceptance of robots is affected by multiple interacting factors, pertaining to the individual, significant others and the wider society. Acceptability can be improved through robots using humanlike communication, being personalised in response to individual users' needs and including issues of trust and control of the robot which relates to degrees of robot adaptivity. However, most studies are of short duration, have small sample sizes and some do not involve actual robot usage or are conducted in laboratories rather than in real world contexts. Larger randomised controlled studies, conducted in the context where robots will be deployed, are needed to investigate how acceptance factors are affected when humans use robots for longer periods of time and become habituated to them.",

abstract="This paper studies beliefs which predict acceptance of smart environments at the user level and the preconditions for acceptance at the societal level. The authors use a thorough literature survey and eight in-depth expert interviews based on four scenarios (home, conference, mall, and gym). As the results indicate, the crucial beliefs for acceptance turn out to be usefulness, ease of use, trust, and social influence at the user level. At the societal level, the preconditions are cultural, economic, and legal. The in-depth interviews confirm some of the results previously reported in the literature including the importance of usefulness, ease of use, and trust for user acceptance. In addition to previous results, social influence as a belief is considered. The external variables affecting beliefs are divided into two categories, namely individual differences and circumstantial differences. Individual differences include variables (age, socio-economic status, experience) already known in the literature, also considering health. Circumstantial differences include audience and place. Place can be public, semi-public, or private and considered from the viewpoints of location (size, pathways) and degree of familiarity. Audience was considered from the amount and role of people at presence (alone, with friends, with strangers). To the authors' knowledge, these circumstantial differences have not been discussed in the user acceptance literature before.",

It investigates the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and product-related characteristics (i.e., portability, automation, and visual attractiveness). The research model and hypotheses are evaluated through Partial least squares analysis, using 313 survey samples. The results show that perceived usefulness and enjoyment have a significant impact on usage intention. Among the three constructs reflecting software- and hardware-based utilitarian value, content quality has the strongest impact on perceived usefulness. From the perspective of hedonic value, content quality, which is also a utilitarian attribute of VPA devices, and visual attractiveness positively affect perceived enjoyment. This study concludes by discussing implications and offering useful suggestions for academia and practice.",

abstract="Western societies are confronted with a number of challenges caused by the increasing number of older citizens. One important aspect is the need and wish of older people to live as long as possible in their own home and maintain an independent life. As people grew older, their social networks disperse, with friends and families moving to other parts of town, other cities or even countries. Additionally, people become less mobile with age, leading to less active participation in societal life. Combined, this normal, age-related development leads to increased loneliness and social isolation of older people, with negative effects on mental and physical health of those people. In the AGNES project, a home-based system has been developed that allows connecting elderly with their families, friends and other significant people over the Internet. As most older people have limited experience with computers and often special requirements on technology, one focus of AGNES was to develop with the users novel technological means for interacting with their social network. The resulting system uses ambient displays, tangible interfaces and wearable devices providing ubiquitous options for interaction with the network, and secondary sensors for additionally generating carefully chosen information on the person to be relayed to significant persons. Evaluations show that the chosen modalities for interaction are well adopted by the users.

abstract="To enable elderly people to live independently in their homes, the government aims to de-institutionalize elderly care services by upscaling home care services and care housing and downscaling long-term stays at nursing homes. Increasing use of assistive technologies will play a significant role in the ongoing transformation of care services, however our empirical data shows how difficult appropriation and use of technology are for elderly end-users. In this paper, we suggest a comprehensive elderly care trajectory model that includes the collaborative work of self-care, formal care, informal care and technology. We build our trajectory on empirical studies of elderly people using assistive technology in a care housing and in nursing homes, in addition to Corbin and Strauss' classic work. Our proposal of an elderly care trajectory fits with the municipal care staircase, but challenges its minimalist service level focus, as well as its late and limited introduction of technology.",

abstract="Robots of today are eager to leave constrained industrial environments and embrace unexplored and unstructured areas, for extensive applications in the real world as service and social robots. Hence, in addition to these new physical frontiers, they must face human ones, too. This implies the need to consider a human-robot interaction from the beginning of the design; the possibility for a robot to recognize users' emotions and, in a certain way, to properly react and ``behave''. This could play a fundamental role in their integration in society. However, this capability is still far from being achieved. Over the past decade, several attempts to implement automata for different applications, outside of the industry, have been pursued. But very few applications have tried to consider the emotional state of users in the behavioural model of the robot, since it raises questions such as: how should human emotions be modelled for a correct representation of their state of mind? Which sensing modalities and which classification methods could be the most feasible to obtain this desired knowledge? Furthermore, which applications are the most suitable for the robot to have such sensitivity? In this context, this paper aims to provide a general overview of recent attempts to enable robots to recognize human emotions and interact properly.",

This paper proposes a new inference engine based on the formal concept analysis to achieve activity prediction and recognition, even abnormal behavioral pattern detection for ambient-assisted living. According to occupants' historical data, we explore useful frequent patterns to guide future prediction, recognition and detection tasks. Like the way of human reasoning, the engine could incrementally infer the most probable activity according to successive observations. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical clustering approach to merge activities according to their semantic similarities. As an optimized knowledge discovery approach in hierarchical ambient intelligence environments, it could optimize the prediction accuracies at the earliest stages when only a few observations are available.",

The paper argues for the necessity of moving such technology out of the research laboratory and into the home, where its real impact on the lives of older adults can be assessed. Moreover, a series of recommendations are outlined, encompassing the life cycle of independent living technologies, from ethnographic assessment, through to design, deployment and evaluation.

abstract="The widespread rises in chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes and high blood pressure) have resulted in the need to find more efficient ways of managing patients with these conditions. One such way is by the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies that can gather real-time data from patients and monitor them from a distance, removing the need to be at a medical facility. These technologies can be an integral part of intelligent healthcare environments (e.g., smart homes to monitor and assist elderly patients) which are essential to reducing healthcare costs and improving efficiency. The use of mHealth, however, brings various privacy concerns and challenges. This paper reviews and examines the challenges of preserving user privacy in the context of using mHealth to manage chronic diseases. The paper first discusses mHealth, its importance in managing chronic diseases, and the associated privacy concerns. Second, the paper compares the existing privacy frameworks applicable to mHealth. Third, the key principles gathered from the frameworks are analysed in the context of their suitability for enabling adequate privacy when using mHealth for managing chronic diseases. Finally, the paper argues that a new privacy framework is needed for mHealth in the context of managing chronic diseases.",

abstract="In-air gestural interfaces are gaining popularity due to the increasing availability and low cost of gesture recognition hardware. However, the current literature mainly focuses either on the young adult user group or, when focusing on older people, most studies limit the focus to physical activity or gaming contexts. The suitability of in-air gestural interactions for seniors to control graphical user interfaces in general remains largely unknown. Moreover, since gestural interfaces are considered easy and natural to use, they may represent an advantageous interaction modality for older people. In this study, the authors evaluate the usability of in-air hand gestures for seniors to interact with generic graphical user interfaces. A user study was conducted with 40 participants, where two types of tasks were evaluated: navigation and selection. For each task, two alternative gestures were evaluated: Swipe and Grab and Drag for navigation tasks; Point and Hold and Point and Push for selection tasks. Both qualitative and quantitative feedbacks were gathered, and then, each alternative gesture was systematically compared. Almost all participants (97 {\%}) completed the navigation and selection tasks with at least one gesture, finding this type of interaction enjoyable to use. From the results and observations, the authors propose a set of design implications that future developers can take into account when developing hand gestural interactions for older people.",

abstract="Statistics reveal that globally, the aging population in different stages of dementia are struggling to cope with daily activities and are progressively becoming dependent on care takers thereby making dementia care a challenging social problem. Healthcare systems in smart environments that aim to address this growing social need require the support of technology to recognize and respond in an ubiquitous manner. To incorporate an efficient activity recognition and abnormality detection system in smart environments, the routine activities of the occupant are modeled and any deviation from the activity model is recognized as abnormality. Recognition systems are generally designed using machine learning strategies and in this paper a novel hybrid, data and knowledge-driven approach is introduced. Markov Logic Network (MLN) used in our design is a suitable approach for activity recognition as it integrates common sense knowledge with a probabilistic model that augments the recognition ability of the system. The proposed activity recognition system for dementia care uses a hierarchical approach to detect abnormality in occupant behavior using MLN. The abnormality in the context of dementia care is identified in terms of factors associated with the activity such as objects, location, time and duration. The task of recognition is done in a hierarchical manner based on the priority of the factor that is associated with each layer. The motivation for designing a hierarchical approach was to enable each layer to commence its computation after inferring from the lower layers that the ongoing activity was normal with regard to the associated factors. This hierarchical feature enables quick decisions, as factors that require immediate attention are processed first at the lowest layer. Experimental results indicate that the hierarchical approach has higher accuracy in recognition and efficient response time when compared to the existing approaches.",

abstract="Principlism is the approach promoted by Beauchamp and Childress for addressing the ethics of medical practice. Instead of evaluating clinical decisions by means of full-scale theories from moral philosophy, Beauchamp and Childress refer people to four principles---of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Now it is one thing for principlism to be invoked in an academic literature dwelling on a stock topic of medical ethical writing: end-of-life decisions, for example. It is another when the topic lies further from the mainstream. In such cases the cost of reaching for the familiar Beauchamp and Childress framework, with its formulaic set of concerns, may be to miss something morally important. After discussing an example of the sort of academic literature I have in mind, I propose to distinguish the uses of the formulaic from the uses of the more unapologetically theoretical in applied ethics, and to suggest that the latter can make up for some of the limitations of the former. This is not to say that the more theoretical literature has no limitations of its own, or that it should take the place of the formulaic. On the contrary, there is room in applied ethics and a use in applied ethics for both. But there is a sense in which there is a greater dependence of principlism on theory than the other way round, and at the end I try to spell out the significance of this fact.",

abstract="Due to development of different technologies there has been significant improvement in quality of life. As a result of that, average person's lifetime duration has been increased. That triggers the problem of independent living of senior citizens. One of the main concerns of the world today is how to enable senior citizens to live independently. As a response to that, systems like eWALL are being developed. eWALL for Active Long Living is a FP7 funded project and it aims to develop system which will enable elderly people to live independently. These systems consist of a large number of sensors which make wireless sensor network. In this paper, different wireless technologies that can be used for communication in systems that are designed to support independent living of elderly people, have been described. The most important focus is at wireless personal area network technologies, like ZigBee, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless local area network technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi). There are many obstacles in designing wireless sensor network and most of them concern energy efficiency and interoperability of different technologies that are being used for communication. The main challenge in the current technology world is tremendous increase of use of various wireless devices and technologies, which can cause relatively high interference, so that the wireless devices can stop working. Using cognitive radio in solving the interoperability problem of different wireless technologies in wireless sensor networks has become interesting research topic. In this paper, research on interoperability of different wireless technologies is presented. Using Spectrum Engineering Advanced Monte Carlo Analysis Tool wireless sensors network in home environment was modelled. Interference based on devices layout and activity was investigated. Also, possible improvements that can be made with cognitive radio are investigated and obtained results are given in this paper.",

It is argued that behavioral approach offers a new perspective to understanding China's urban sociospatial reconstruction and addressing social and environmental issues at micro scale. Although theoretical development still lags behind developed countries, Chinese scholars have made much progress in empirical investigations of classical socio-spatial behavior theories. This paper also provides an overview of new trends in Chinese behavioral geography that has started to apply the behavioral approach to urban social, economic and environmental issues. This paper suggests that social dimensions of behavior should be addressed more comprehensively and rigorously by using interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological frameworks, to better understand the complexity of Chinese cities and research the critical social and environmental issues in cities.",

One of them is the technological assistance of elders who are suffering from a cognitive deficit with the execution of their everyday life activities inside what is called a smart home. To enable this technology, the first challenge to overcome is the recognition of the resident's activities of daily living (ADLs). This problem consists of inferring the minimal set of possible ongoing ADLs using templates (plans) of activities defined in a library. To successfully achieve that goal, we must exploit constraints of different natures (logical, temporal, etc.) in order to reject a maximal number of hypotheses. However, only a minority of works exploited the elementary spatial aspects related to objects and to their relations in the smart environment. In this paper, we propose a novel recognition model exploiting the fundamental qualitative spatial reasoning approach of Egenhofer to discriminate implausible ongoing activities. Furthermore, the model is validated through extensive testing of realistic scenarios based on clinical trials conducted at our laboratory with both normal and impaired subjects.",

abstract="This paper reports the description of a multi-sensor platform able to automatically assess the level of physical activity and sedentary time of older adults. The platform has a hierarchical network topology, compound by N detector nodes managing several ambient sensor nodes and one detector node that manages a wearable sensor node. The system provides also one coordinator node that receives high-level reports from detector nodes. The idea of using heterogeneous sensors is motivated by the fact that in this way we expands the number of end-users, as they may accept only a type of sensor technology. The objective assessment was conducted through two main algorithmic steps: (1) recognition of well-defined set of human activities, detected by a 3D vision sensor (ambient node) and a smart garment (wearable sensor node), and (2) estimation of a physiological measure, that is (MET)-minutes. Results obtained in terms of activity recognition (and subsequent physical activity/sedentary time assessment) showed that the integrated version of the platform performs better than each single sensor technology with an overall accuracy obtained using simultaneously data provided from both sensory technologies that is about 5{\%} higher of single sub-system, thus confirming the advantage in using a coordinator node. Finally, an added value of this work is the capability of the platform in providing a sensing invariant interface (i.e., abstracted from any specific sensing technology), since the use of the activities enables the integration of a wide set of devices, providing that they are able to reproduce the same set of features.",

The fundamental process of any automatic activity monitoring system is therefore to process streams of sensor events and detect occurrences of activities. In this study, we propose three segmentation algorithms to separate time series sensor data into segments to be further processed by an activity recognition algorithm. A preliminary evaluation of the approaches developed has been conducted on a data set collected from a single person living in an apartment over a period of 28 days. The results show that the proposed approaches can segment sensor data to detect activities and infer sensor segments to recognise activities with accuracies of 81.6, 81.6 and 82.9{\%}, respectively.",

abstract="This paper presents a fuzzy expert system-based framework for flood management in Saudi Arabia that helps the civil defense (CD) authority in both preparing their flood management capabilities and responding to scalable levels of flood risk. One of the most important type of flood management capabilities is training capabilities, the adequacy of training capabilities of emergency responders is a critical factor that influences on flood risk management, even considering other types of capabilities such as equipment and infrastructure. However, due to the lack of adequate training capabilities in place to address dynamic change of flood risk and vulnerabilities in some areas, emergency readiness for floods has been critically affected and resulted in ineffective response and mutual aid. Here, the study aimed to aid decision-makers in the Saudi CD Authority to reduce inappropriate readiness of training capabilities in some critical zones and maintain the levels of readiness using a proposed fuzzy expert system-based framework, which is named the capability evaluation and readiness (CER) framework. The developed CER framework includes a new fuzzy expert system, which is named the intelligent capability evaluation and readiness (ICER) system. CER framework uses three key elements for readiness evaluation and addressing needs related to training capabilities; the records of the provided training and exercises; the targeted standard and policy of readiness and mutual aid; and risk assessment of each zone and existing hazard and vulnerability (HV) factors within a zone. The results of evaluation by interviews indicted high agreement on effectiveness and productivity of the CER framework, however, it is recommended that additional stakeholders are included in order to have comprehensive information regarding others HV factors. In addition, questionnaires shown that more than 60{\%} of the respondents believe that the ICER system is an effective tool for flood response, however, regarding the readiness of the training capabilities, more that 17{\%} of the respondents believe that the ICER system is not effective tool to improving the readiness of the training capabilities.",

abstract="A fundamental problem for disabled or elderly people is to manage their homes while carrying out an almost normal life, which implies using and interacting with a number of home devices. Recent studies in smart homes have proposed methods to use a laser pointer for interacting with home devices, which represents a more user-friendly and less expensive home device control environment. However, detecting the laser spot on the original non-filtered images, using standard and non-expensive cameras, and considering real home environments with varying conditions, is currently an open problem.",

abstract="eWALL framework, under development in the European eWALL project (project no. 610658: ``eWALL for Active Long Living'') is meant for care of population with age related impairments, mild dementia and COPD. Expanded eWALL (e2WALL) is planned to be an integrated quality framework for long-term care services which will cover very different types of care: all healthcare (both preventive and rehabilitative), societal services, care for cognitive diseases, services delivered at home as well as support for caregivers as an integral part of the quality improvement process. Thus, we present e2WALL home system that would encompass installation (setup) of e2WALL in homes (flats, houses and aging homes) and their management and maintenance across Europe, starting from the partners involved in eWALL (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands and Romania) and expanding the partnership to the most of Europe (e.g. United Kingdom, Poland, Czech Republic{\ldots}). This would be a direct application of the developed e2WALL platform and should be done through a network of collaborating small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), each of whom would lead the process of setting up e2WALL system and continuing to provide support services to homes in their respective country. In this way, the growth of high tech and innovative SMEs will be ensured at pan European level, which will enable growth over restricted national market and stimulate European investments in SMEs and startups. Actually, the bigger platform will enable e2WALL European Ecosystem (e4WALL), which can then expand into other non-European markets (e.g. Asia, USA) and means sustainability beyond the life of the project. e2WALL will lead to connected tech start-up hubs to the larger European business ecosystem and will contribute to increased access of country-specific and customized new product to the pan European market, which will lead to increase of employed qualified individuals. Another important focus would be creating an energy efficient environment for a new social network where registered users would provide on-demand services.",

abstract="In recent years, building energy consumption has increased in response to climate change, resulting in a worldwide reduction of energy efficiency. A strong response is required, through both the enhancement of building energy efficiency and the reduction of power usage. These objectives could be achieved by pursuing ``Blackout'' prevention, through developing a control unit such as that of the urban energy grid system that was used in the Energy Operation Center (EOC) for smart cities. In this context, this paper presents an optimization operation technique for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), using control monitor-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient operation of the EOC. BIM is one of the approaches that can be used for the visual representation, management, and exchange of information on all aspects of a building. The EOC should be able to efficiently represent the data from the building information, and the operator maintaining it should be able to promptly acquire the data for handling it. This suggests that the control of energy consumption by a Building Automation System (BAS) to maximize building energy efficiency will lead to improved total energy performance, reduced operating costs, and reduced environmental impact.",

abstract="Expectations play a distinctive role in shaping emerging technologies and producing hype cycles when a technology is adopted or fails on the market. To harness expectations, facilitate and provoke forward-looking discussions, and identify policy alternatives, futures studies are required. Here, expert anticipation of possible or probable future developments becomes extremely arbitrary beyond short-term prediction, and the results of futures studies are often controversial, divergent, or even contradictory; thus they are contested. Nevertheless, such socio-technical imaginaries may prescribe a future that seems attainable to those involved in the visioneering process, and other futures may thus become less likely and shaping them could become more difficult. This implies a need to broaden the debate on socio-technological development, creating spaces where policy, science, and society can become mutually responsive to each other. Laypeople's experiential and value-based knowledge is highly relevant for complementing expertise to inform socially robust decision-making in science and technology. This paper presents the evolution of a transdisciplinary, forward-looking co-creation process---a demand-side approach developed to strengthen needs-driven research and innovation governance by cross-linking knowledge of laypeople, experts, and stakeholders. Three case studies serve as examples. We argue that this approach can be considered a method for adding social robustness to visioneering and to responsible socio-technical change.",

abstract="Efficient computation of quality of service (QoS) during medical data processing through intelligent measurement methods is one of the mandatory requirements of the medial healthcare world. However, emergency medical services often involve transmission of critical data, thus having stringent requirements for network quality of service (QoS). This paper contributes in three distinct ways. First, it proposes the novel adaptive QoS computation algorithm (AQCA) for fair and efficient monitoring of the performance indicators, i.e., transmission power, duty cycle and route selection during medical data processing in healthcare applications. Second, framework of QoS computation in medical applications is proposed at physical, medium access control (MAC) and network layers. Third, QoS computation mechanism with proposed AQCA and quality of experience (QoE) is developed. Besides, proper examination of QoS computation for medical healthcare application is evaluated with 4--10 inches large-screen user terminal (UT) devices (for example, LCD panel size, resolution, etc.). These devices are based on high visualization, battery lifetime and power optimization for ECG service in emergency condition. These UT devices are used to achieve highest level of satisfaction in terms, i.e., less power drain, extended battery lifetime and optimal route selection. QoS parameters with estimation of QoE perception identify the degree of influence of each QoS parameters on the medical data processing is analyzed. The experimental results indicate that QoS is computed at physical, MAC and network layers with transmission power (−{\thinspace}15 dBm), delay (100 ms), jitter (40 ms), throughput (200 Bytes), duty cycle (10{\%}) and route selection (optimal). Thus it can be said that proposed AQCA is the potential candidate for QoS computation than Baseline for medical healthcare applications.",

These systems do not adapt to the real needs of users with different profiles, and neglect that the user's requirements may evolve over time. This research work aims to develop a new adaptive smart system able to support users (with and without disabilities) in performing daily tasks by recognizing their preferences and actions and adapting the system feedback consequently.With the aim to develop an easy, efficient and usable adaptive smart system, the final users have been involved in the whole design and development process.

abstract="Interaction in smart environments should be adapted to the users' preferences, e.g., utilising modalities appropriate for the situation. While manual customisation of a single application could be feasible, this approach would require too much user effort in the future, when a user interacts with numerous applications with different interfaces, such as e.g. a smart car, a smart fridge, a smart shopping assistant etc. Supporting user groups, jointly interacting with the same application, poses additional challenges: humans tend to respect the preferences of their friends and family members, and thus the preferred interface settings may depend on all group members. This work proposes to decrease the manual customisation effort by addressing the cold-start adaptation problem, i.e., predicting interface preferences of individuals and groups for new (unseen) combinations of applications, tasks and devices, based on knowledge regarding preferences of other users. For predictions we suggest several reasoning strategies and employ a classifier selection approach for automatically choosing the most appropriate strategy for each interface feature in each new situation. The proposed approach is suitable for cases where long interaction histories are not yet available, and it is not restricted to similar interfaces and application domains, as we demonstrate by experiments on predicting preferences of individuals and groups for three different application prototypes: recipe recommender, cooking assistant and car servicing assistant. The results show that the proposed method handles the cold-start problem in various types of unseen situations fairly well: it achieved an average prediction accuracy of {\$}{\$}72 {\backslash}pm 1{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}72{\textpm}1{\%}. Further studies on user acceptance of predictions with two different user communities have shown that this is a desirable feature for applications in smart environments, even when predictions are not so accurate and when users do not perceive manual customisation as very time-consuming.",

abstract="Smart homes are becoming a growing need to prepare for a comfortable life style for the elderly and make things easy for the caretakers of the future. One important component of these systems is to identify the human activities and scenarios. As the wireless technologies are becoming advanced, they are being used to provide a low-cost, non-intrusive and privacy-conscious solution to activity recognition. However, in more complicated environments, we need to identify scenarios with subtle cues e.g. eye gaze. These situations call for a complementary vision-based solution, and we present a robust scenario recognition system by following the objects seen in eye gaze trajectories. In this paper, we present a probabilistic hierarchical model for scenario recognition using the environmental elements like objects in the scene. We utilize the fact that any scenario can be divided into constituent tasks and activities recursively to the level of atomic actions and objects. Considering bottom-up, the scenario recognition problem can be hierarchically solved by identifying the objects seen and combining them together to form coarse-grained higher level activities. This is a novel contribution to be able to recognize complete scenarios only on the basis of objects seen. We performed experiments on standard datasets of Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA-Gaze) and unconstrained videos collected ``in the Wild''; and trained an Artificial Neural Network to get a precision of 73.84{\%} and accuracy of 92.27{\%}.",

abstract="In the last few years there has been a growing interest in Human activity recognition (HAR) topic. Sensor-based HAR approaches, in particular, has been gaining more popularity owing to their privacy preserving nature. Furthermore, due to the widespread accessibility of the internet, a broad range of streaming-based applications such as online HAR, has emerged over the past decades. However, proposing sufficiently robust online activity recognition approach in smart environment setting is still considered as a remarkable challenge. This paper presents a novel online application of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model in order to detect the current activity on the live streaming of sensor events. Our method consists of two phases. In the first phase, data stream is segmented based on the beginning and ending of the activity patterns. Also, on-going activity is reported with every receiving observation. This phase is implemented using Hierarchical Hidden Markov models. The second phase is devoted to the correction of the provided label for the segmented data stream based on statistical features. The proposed model can also discover the activities that happen during another activity - so-called interrupted activities. After detecting the activity pane, the predicted label will be corrected utilizing statistical features such as time of day at which the activity happened and the duration of the activity. We validated our proposed method by testing it against two different smart home datasets and demonstrated its effectiveness, which is competing with the state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract="Abandoning fossil fuels and increasingly relying on low-density, land-intensive renewable energy will increase demand for land, affecting current global and regional rural--urban relationships. Over the past two decades, rural--urban relationships all over the world have witnessed unprecedented changes that have rendered their boundaries blurred and have lead to the emergence of ``new ruralities.'' In this paper, we analyze the current profiles of electricity generation and consumption in relation to sociodemographic variables related to the use of time and land across the territory of Catalonia, Spain. Through a clustering procedure based on multivariate statistical analysis, we found that electricity consumption is related to functional specialization in the roles undertaken by different types of municipalities in the urban system. Municipality types have distinctive metabolic profiles in different sectors depending on their industrial, services or residential role. Villages' metabolism is influenced by urban sprawl and industrial specialization, reflecting current ``new ruralities.'' Segregation between work activity and residence increases both overall electricity consumption and its rate (per hour) and density (per hectare) of dissipation. A sustainable spatial organization of societal activities without the use of fossil fuels or nuclear energy would require huge structural and sociodemographic changes to reduce energy demand and adapt it to regionally available renewable energy.",

This system, equipped with a combination of various non-invasive sensors, can monitor an elderly user's sleep behavior. It accumulates the detecting data from a pressure sensor matrix and ultra wide band (UWB) tags. Based on these two types of complementary sensing data, SPRS can assess the user's sleep pattern automatically via machine learning algorithms. Compared to existing systems, SPRS operateswithout disrupting the users' sleep. It can be used in normal households with minimal deployment.

It was found that users of all ages were wishing for service robots to help handle home chores, and they expected the robot to complete the task with good reliability and efficiency. However, users of different age groups showed different patterns of concerns over robot usage. A multi-generational perspective is helpful to understand users' needs and attitudes that reflect age differences. It also provides insights into how members of a family share attitudes towards robots.",

abstract="The need to manage embedded systems, brought forward by the wider adoption of pervasive computing, is particularly vital in the context of secure and safety-critical applications. Technology infiltrates in ordinary things, hitching intelligence and materializing smart systems. Each of these individual entities monitors a specific set of parameters and deduces a constrained local view of the surrounding environment. Many distributed devices exchange information in order to infer the real system state and achieve a consistent global view. However, conflicts may arise due to the integration of deficit pieces of local knowledge. Robust and efficient conflict resolution is essential, especial in cases of emergency where the system must contribute with timely and accurate data to the overall crisis management operation. In this paper, we present AmbISPDM -- a formal framework for the management of embedded systems with a coherent conflict resolution mechanism. The process is implemented as a software agent's reasoning behaviour and applied in the multi-agent domain. As a proof of concept, a smart university campus setting is deployed, with agents controlling embedded devices to assist living conditions in normal operation and the evacuation planning in case of fire.",

A large range of countries around the world has decided to strengthen their resolve to have their broadband infrastructures built out and upgraded. The size of bandwidth requirements is, however, not an issue, which has been subject to much analysis from an academic angle whereas a number of consultancy reports with estimations on bandwidth needs for different services can be found. The needs for broadband access up until 2020 are discussed by scrutinizing the different services and applications requiring bandwidth. The bandwidth requirements in question are those of residential users and SMEs. In the paper it is assumed that users of broadband connections will use broadband for all their digital communications and further the paper focuses on the requirements for bandwidth notwithstanding the pricing of access. It is the estimated bandwidth need and not the actual demand, which is the subject of analysis. Scenarios including different types of households and different kinds of SMEs are presented.",

abstract="Steady increases in healthcare costs and obesity have inspired recent studies into cost-effective, assistive systems capable of monitoring dietary habits. Few researchers, though, have investigated the use of video as a means of monitoring dietary activities. Video possesses several inherent qualities, such as passive acquisition, that merits its analysis as an input modality for such an application. To this end, we propose a method to automatically detect chewing events in surveillance video of a subject. Firstly, an Active Appearance Model (AAM) is used to track a subject's face across the video sequence. It is observed that the variations in the AAM parameters across chewing events demonstrate a distinct periodicity. We utilize this property to discriminate between chewing and non-chewing facial actions such as talking. A feature representation is constructed by applying spectral analysis to a temporal window of model parameter values. The estimated power spectra subsequently undergo non-linear dimensionality reduction. The low-dimensional embedding of the power spectra are employed to train a binary Support Vector Machine classifier to detect chewing events. To emulate the gradual onset and offset of chewing, smoothness is imposed over the class predictions of neighboring video frames in order to deter abrupt changes in the class labels. Experiments are conducted on a dataset consisting of 37 subjects performing each of five actions, namely, open- and closed-mouth chewing, clutter faces, talking, and still face. Experimental results yielded a cross-validated percentage agreement of 93.0{\%}, indicating that the proposed system provides an efficient approach to automated chewing detection.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) is focused on providing assistance to people primarily in their natural environment. Over the past decade, the AAL domain has evolved at a fast pace in various directions. The stakeholders of AAL are not only limited to patients, but also include their relatives, social services, health workers, and care agencies. In fact, AAL aims at increasing the life quality of patients, their relatives and the health care providers with a holistic approach. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the AAL domain, presenting a systematic analysis of over 10 years of relevant literature focusing on the stakeholders' needs, bridging the gap of existing reviews which focused on technologies. The findings of this review clearly show that until now the AAL domain neglects the view of the entire AAL ecosystem. Furthermore, the proposed solutions seem to be tailored more on the basis of the available existing technologies, rather than supporting the various stakeholders' needs. Another major lack that thisreview is pointing out is a missing adequate evaluation of the various solutions. Finally, it seems that, as the domain of AAL is pretty new, it is still in its incubation phase. Thus, this review calls for moving the AAL domain to a more mature phase with respect to the research approaches.",

abstract="A socio-technical system (STS) consists of an interplay of humans, organizations, and technical systems. STSs are heterogeneous, dynamic, unpredictable, and weakly controllable. Their operational environment changes unexpectedly, actors join and leave the system at will, actors fail to meet their objectives and under-perform, and dependencies on other actors are violated. To deal with such situations, we propose an architecture for STSs that makes an STS self-reconfigurable, i.e., capable of switching autonomously from one configuration to a better one. Our architecture performs a Monitor-Diagnose-Reconcile-Compensate cycle: it monitors actor behaviors and context changes, diagnoses failures and under-performance by checking whether monitored behavior is compliant with actors goals, finds a possible way to address the problem, and enacts compensation actions to reconcile actual and desired behavior. Compensation actions take into account the autonomy of participants in an STS, which cannot be controlled. Our architecture is requirements driven: we use extended Tropos goal models to diagnose failures as well as to identify alternative strategies to meet requirements. After presenting our conceptual architecture and the algorithms, it is founded upon; we describe a prototype implementation applied to a case study concerning smart-homes. We also provide experimental results that suggest that our architecture scales well as the size of the STS grows.",

This research paper presents the comprehensive study to identify and review existing mHealth dementia applications (apps), and also synthesize the evidence of using these applications in assisting people with dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers. Six electronic databases searched with the purpose of finding literature-based evidence. The search yielded 2818 research articles, with 29 meeting quantified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six groups and their associated sub-groups emerged from the literature. The main groups are (1) activities of daily living (ADL) based cognitive training, (2) monitoring, (3) dementia screening, (4) reminiscence and socialization, (5) tracking, and (6) caregiver support. Moreover, two commercial mobile application stores i.e., Apple App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) explored with the intention of identifying the advantages and disadvantages of existing commercially available dementia and AD healthcare apps. From 678 apps, a total of 38 mobile apps qualified as per defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. The shortlisted commercial apps generally targeted different aspects of dementia as identified in research articles. This comprehensive study determined the feasibility of using mobile Health based applications for dementia including AD individuals and their caregivers regardless of limited available research, and these apps have capability to incorporate a variety of strategies and resources to dementia community care.",

Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technologies will never replace personal care, but can help to decrease costs by relieving care personnel and allowing elderly to stay independently at their own home for a longer time. Improvements in sensing technology lead to well-engineered and context-aware devices, that ease ones daily living activities, but there is still a gap according to data fusion. Current AmI applications face issues, such as: (i) proper situation classification, (ii) reduction of interpretation faults, (iii) action triggering, and (iv) projecting the future situation evaluation. There exists a huge amount of prototypes and systems, motivated by different requirements (use cases for processing environmental data, vital data, health data), which still have open issues when a global view on the data is needed for gaining situation awareness (SAW). This paper gives an overview of existing projects and seminal developments within the scope of AmI. After a survey on various AmI projects a common reference architecture was figured out and evaluation criteria focusing on SAW were defined. The criteria were used to classify selected projects and identify obstacles that avoid gaining SAW. In the end open issues and potential improvements are discussed and a perspective for further developments is given.",

abstract="Along with the widespread use of smartphones, activity recognition using embedded inertial sensors has intrigued researchers. The learning and employing activity recognition systems suffers from some challenges. Training data of different persons should be involved in the learning procedure. In contrast, the activities of each individual should remain private. In addition, the style of different individuals activities makes the training phase become a challenging problem. This paper presents two privacy-preserving transfer learning algorithms for activity recognition application namely as {\$}{\$}P^{\{}2{\}}S^{\{}2{\}}{\{}{\}} {\{} TM{\}}{\$}{\$}P2S2TMand {\$}{\$}P^{\{}2{\}}{\{}{\}} {\{} DS{\}}^{\{}2{\}}{\{}{\}} {\{} TM{\}}{\$}{\$}P2DS2TM.

Moreover, it highlights the open issues and challenges related to providing healthcare services in the medical centre server within telemedicine. Methodological aspects to control and manage the process of healthcare service provision and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first phase presents the identification process to propose a decision matrix (DM) on the basis of a crossover of `multi-healthcare services' and `hospital list' within intelligent data and service management centre (Tier 4). The second phase discusses the development of a DM for hospital selection on the basis of integrated VIKOR-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods.

Automatic detection of falls from video sequences is an assistant technology for low-cost health care systems. In this paper, we present a novel slow feature analysis based framework for fall detection in a house care environment. Firstly, a foreground human body is extracted by a background subtraction technique. After morphological operations, the human silhouette is refined and covered by a fitted ellipse. Secondly, six shape features are quantified from the covered silhouette to represent different human postures. With the help of the learned slow feature functions, the shape feature sequences are transformed into slow feature sequences with discriminative information about human actions. To represent the fall incidents, the squared first order temporal derivatives of the slow features are accumulated into a classification vector. Lastly, falls are distinguished from other daily actions, such as walking, crouching, and sitting, by the trained directed acyclic graph support vector machine. Experiments on the multiple-camera fall dataset and the SDUFall dataset demonstrate that our method is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving 94.00{\%} recognition rate on the former dataset and 96.57{\%} on the latter one.",

Allowing AD patients to handle their daily activities not only can release the burdens on their families and caregivers, it is also highly important to help them regain confidence towards a healthy life. The daily activities of a patient captured from SmartMind can also serve as an important indicator to describe his/her normal living habit (NLH). By checking NLH, the patient's current health status can be estimated on a daily basis. In the testing experiments of SmartMind, we have demonstrated the accuracy of SmartMind in activity detection and investigated its performance when different machine learning algorithms were adopted for posture detection. The performance results indicate that both support vector machine (SVM) and naive bayes (NB) can achieve an accuracy of higher than 97 {\%} while the random forrests (RF) only gives an accuracy of around 73 {\%}.",

abstract="A comprehensive and evaluative review of empirical research published between 2000 and 2010 specific to long distance caregiving is provided to identify what is known about this subgroup of caregivers and to identify gaps in knowledge. We searched peer-reviewed journals included in the following databases: Academic Search Premier (EBSCO), PROQuest Direct, Social Work Abstracts, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsychInfo. Searches were restricted to English language publications between 2000 and 2010. Search terms included: `review + caregiving + dementia', `meta-analyses + caregiving + dementia,' `caregiving + dementia + not institutional,' `informal + caregiving,' `family + caregiving', `caregiving + technology'. Any searches including the term `dementia' were repeated without that term. These same searches were repeated with the term `distance' added to each. Empirical research specific to long distance caregiving is reviewed in detail. A brief review is provided of other closely related research. Long distance caregivers report being heavily involved in the care of their family member, regardless of distance and surprisingly, are often the only or primary caregiver. The specific needs for future research to inform best practice that goes beyond description of this important subgroup of caregivers is discussed.",

abstract="In this paper, by applying motion detection and machine learning technologies, we have designed and developed an activity tracking and monitoring system, called SmartMind, to help Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients to live independently within their living rooms while providing emergency assistances and supports when necessary. Allowing AD patients to handle their daily activities not only can release the burdens on their families and caregivers, it is also highly important to help them regain confidence towards a healthy life. The daily activities of a patient captured from SmartMind can also serve as an important indicator to describe his/her normal living habit (NLH). By checking NLH, the patient's current health status can be estimated on a daily basis. In the testing experiments of SmartMind, we have demonstrated the accuracy of SmartMind in activity detection and investigated its performance when different machine learning algorithms were adopted for posture detection. The performance results indicate that both support vector machine (SVM) and naive bayes (NB) can achieve an accuracy of higher than 97 {\%} while the random forrests (RF) only gives an accuracy of around 73 {\%}.",

abstract="Localization is an important primitive that is utilized in a number of important applications such as location-based mobile services, augmented reality, and autonomous mobile robotics. While the GPS technology is considered the de facto standard for outdoor localization, it is known to suffer from significant accuracy limitation in urban areas. In this work, we present a particle filter--based data fusion technique for localization in urban areas. The proposed localization technique provides more accurate location estimation results due to its ability to efficiently fuse together information collected from diverse sensor technologies. The novelty of our proposed approach stems from its ability to fuse data from diverse sources, namely, phase shift fingerprints collected from Low Power AM Radio (LPAM) towers and inertial measurement sensors. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy of 0.5 m using a limited number of LPAM towers as low as 5. Also, the proposed approach requires the collection of a low number of LPAM phase shift fingerprints. Our simulations indicate that 30 fingerprints are enough to provide 0.5 m accuracy in a 100 {\texttimes} 100 m2 deployment.",

The evolution of this paradigm in the Internet has even given birth to tools like Microsoft Popfly or Yahoo Pipes, thanks to which end users with no specific computer skills are able to create their own highly personalized services. In an environment like home care, where each user has very specific individualized needs, the application of this new paradigm seems very promising, and to promote that philosophy porting, this paper presents a system to allow each individual and his/her carers to build, execute, and manage the specific personalized monitoring, comfort, automation, and safety applications required.

abstract="User preferences need to be taken into account in order to be able to design devices that will gain acceptance both in a clinical and home setting. Sensor systems become redundant if patients or clinicians do not want to work with them. The aim of this systematic review was to determine both patients' and clinicians' preferences for non-invasive body-worn sensor systems. A search for relevant articles and conference proceedings was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents Connect, and EEEI explore. In total 843 papers were identified of which only 11 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. A range of different clinically relevant user groups were included. The key user preferences were that a body-worn sensor system should be compact, embedded and simple to operate and maintain. It also should not affect daily behavior nor seek to directly replace a health care professional. It became apparent that despite the importance of user preferences, they are rarely considered and as such there is a lack of high-quality studies in this area. We therefore would like to encourage researchers to focus on the implications of user preferences when designing wearable sensor systems.",

abstract="The use of Intelligent Assistive Technology (IAT) in dementia care opens the prospects of reducing the global burden of dementia and enabling novel opportunities to improve the lives of dementia patients. However, with current adoption rates being reportedly low, the potential of IATs might remain under-expressed as long as the reasons for suboptimal adoption remain unaddressed. Among these, ethical and social considerations are critical. This article reviews the spectrum of IATs for dementia and investigates the prevalence of ethical considerations in the design of current IATs. Our screening shows that a significant portion of current IATs is designed in the absence of explicit ethical considerations. These results suggest that the lack of ethical consideration might be a codeterminant of current structural limitations in the translation of IATs from designing labs to bedside. Based on these data, we call for a coordinated effort to proactively incorporate ethical considerations early in the design and development of new products.",

abstract="In the past 10 years, the concept of smart homes and buildings has become progressively mainstream with the introduction of several commercial solutions and available sensor technologies. One of the most important aspects of a smart home system is sensing, which is typically leveraged to observe, understand and predict the daily behavior of the occupant. This sensing of a smart home's occupant extends to personal location estimation, behavior detection, and activity monitoring. However, there is always a trade off between the amount of information that can be sensed and the loss of privacy of the occupant. Cameras coupled with state of the art computer vision algorithms can provide much more nuanced and rich information than binary sensors, like motion sensors, door sensors and so on. Unfortunately, cameras are not well tolerated by people in their homes and other private areas for privacy protection reasons. In this article, an intensive study was performed on a dataset gathered in a smart home test bed equipped with binary motion sensors. Leveraging our previous works in a concurrent activation model that describes an occupant's mobility along with the newly defined continuity property of a occupant's mobility, we propose a bipartite sensor graph with intersection sensor nodes that models a occupant's high level mobility. We then developed a trajectory propagation algorithm, which can generate an occupant's most probable trajectories and locations. We show that by using the concurrent activation events of a binary motion sensor network we can extract useful high level details of an occupant's behavior.",

abstract="One of the first steps in innovation projects and entrepreneurial initiative involves formulating a Business Model (BM) that describes the value creation, delivery and capturing logic of a business idea. However, when formulating a BM for networked enterprises, the alignment of the collective BM, supporting the joint service or product on offer, and the underlying operational processes of the networked businesses, need to be taken into account. This paper analyses the concept of Business Model Alignment (BMA) based on qualitative case studies of two Smart Living projects in Finland and China. To begin with, a Business Model framework (STOF) is applied to describe the high-level BM. Next, the Value, Information and Process (VIP) framework is applied to analyse BMA. The case studies show that an analytical framework, such as the VIP model, helps reveal the hurdles that may undermine BMA and, as a result, obstruct BM implementation. This paper contributes to existing BM literature by identifying the steps that are necessary to move from an abstract, often strategy-driven BM, of collaborating enterprises towards an aligned BM that can be implemented. This paper also contributes to theory formation by identifying the issues that play a role in achieving BMA.",

As a result, significant research in the area of assistive technologies for the elderly has been undertaken to help manage this growing demographic segment. Our contribution to this effort is based on leveraging environmental sensors to track occupants for extended durations in their homes in order to extract and track various behavioral patterns in order to identify atypical activities. To aid in our detection of behavioral patterns, we extract additional intermediate indicators of mobility and behavior such as estimates of an occupant's position as well as other parameters such as guest visitations. In our initial research, we did not associate these instances of atypical behaviors with any specific health events. Our primary goal was to see if it was possible to detect atypical behaviors using only the limited data that can be extracted using passive infrared sensors. We compared the days when atypical patterns were detected with the similar analysis of a human annotated activity log and determined that there is a strong correlation between patterns extracted from our derived behavioral indicators and those from the annotated activities. We also compared our systems result's across multiple datasets to verify that our approach could be applied to different sensor configurations and occupants.",

Expanding the growing automatization of many activities in daily life, automated technologies in the home are interactive, ubiquitous, and often invisible. Their installation, in what is understood to be the locus of personal autonomy and identity, promotes a rethinking on the notion of the self as it is shaped and reshaped within the home. Because these technologies are user-centric, they bring to mind questions as to how their users are envisioned. The current study will focus on human physicality and on the materiality of the body as it is envisaged in the technologies themselves through the study of three automated domestic systems. It will ask if and how our understanding of being a body---or, perhaps, of having one---is redefined as these new technologies assume a growing role in the living of everyday domestic life.",

Nonetheless, the reliance of interaction of human computer on written text and images makes the utilization of computers incomprehensible for visually and physically impaired and illiterate masses. Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis helps researchers of speech processing to follow up on this issue by synthesizing speech (in Indian local languages e.g. Punjabi, Hindi, Tamil etc.) from written text in browsers, mobile phones etc. A TTS system is a computer system that converts text into speech, i.e. automatically reads the text when asked to do so. This system is a blend of both software and hardware. Generally text (sentence) is composed of collection of words, while words are combination of alphabets arranged in a meaningful way. In this research work, the authors implemented a translation system where Punjabi text is converted into speech by using nourish forwarding algorithm. The accuracy of text to speech conversion is compared with Splitting Algorithm and its efficiency is marginally enhanced.",

abstract="IEEE 802.15.4 targets low data rate communication with limited power devices and cheap wireless networking solutions. In recent years both industry and academia are attracted to IEEE 802.15.4 because of its applicability in wireless sensor networks and wireless body area networks. An important feature of IEEE 802.15.4 is its very low duty cycle operation for conserving energy consumption of sensor device. Super-frame structure of IEEE 802.15.4 defines the duty cycle of nodes. The super-frame structure is based on two parameters: beacon order (BO) and super-frame order (SO). The performance of an IEEE 802.15.4 network depends on the values of BO and SO. These values depict the energy consumption, throughput, node discovery and latency of communication. IEEE 802.15.4 uses fixed BO and SO values which can be carefully chosen to meet the network requirements. In this paper, an extensive survey of dynamic super-frame adjustment algorithms is presented. The survey focuses on beacon-enabled star topology of IEEE 802.15.4 and studies the impact of aforementioned algorithms for various applications. Also, the survey categorizes common IEEE 802.15.4 applications based on their requirements for super-frame adjustment. A brief simulation analysis is included in this survey to highlight the impact of BO and SO on the network performance.",

By 2038, an estimated 1.1 million Canadians will be experiencing dementia, with unprecedented impact on social, economic and health landscapes. In September 2015, the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences convened a Forum, with the specific thematic goals of reviewing progress towards effective dementia treatment and prevention, improved systems of care, advanced living and built environments, and impactful technology developments. The orientation of the Forum was to focus on potential solutions and advances in these areas. These areas are integral to the goal of a national end-to-end program, where all affected Canadians can be optimally supported in their communities and receive quality of care - regardless of where they live or who they are.",

abstract="The Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA) proposed six Action Groups. After almost three years of activity, many achievements have been obtained through commitments or collaborative work of the Action Groups. However, they have often worked in silos and, consequently, synergies between Action Groups have been proposed to strengthen the triple win of the EIP on AHA. The paper presents the methodology and current status of the Task Force on EIP on AHA synergies. Synergies are in line with the Action Groups' new Renovated Action Plan (2016-2018) to ensure that their future objectives are coherent and fully connected. The outcomes and impact of synergies are using the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the EIP on AHA (MAFEIP). Eight proposals for synergies have been approved by the Task Force: Five cross-cutting synergies which can be used for all current and future synergies as they consider overarching domains (appropriate polypharmacy, citizen empowerment, teaching and coaching on AHA, deployment of synergies to EU regions, Responsible Research and Innovation), and three cross-cutting synergies focussing on current Action Group activities (falls, frailty, integrated care and chronic respiratory diseases).",

abstract="According to numerous authors, residents play a decisive role in any place branding strategy, although paradoxically, they have played little or no role in the implementation of place branding strategies in recent years. It is for this reason that this study emphasises so-called ``internal place branding''. Furthermore, we aim to determine whether the outwardly projected attributes of Barcelona (Spain) correspond to the attributes held by its residents. To achieve this aim, we undertook a cross-sectional descriptive study using a mixed method survey questionnaire in order to measure residents' perceptions, with both open-ended and closed-ended questions. We selected 300 participants using the snowball sampling strategy. Results showed that residents of Barcelona, as a whole, perceived their city as cultural, creative, cosmopolitan, touristic, entertaining and friendly, attributes that closely match those projected by the city over recent decades. However, we also found a certain distancing of residents with respect to other values projected by Brand Barcelona. We believe this study provides important managerial implications not only for Barcelona's brand managers, but also for professionals all over the world seeking to work with internal place branding.",

For each of these categories, this paper mentions a brief future outline. This review study indicates mainly three types of future development directions for BIM methodologies, domains and article types: (1) BIM methodologies are tending to be developed toward expertise orientation. (2) It is suggested that different social science methodologies could be implemented using BIM as another kind of expert methodology. (3) The ability to continually change and learning capability is the driving power of BIM methodologies and will be the key for future intelligent applications.",

abstract="The rise in living standards that has occurred with the advancement of new technologies has increased the demand for sophisticated standards-based health-care applications that provide services anytime, anywhere, and with low cost. To achieve this objective, we have designed and developed the Smart Clinical Decision Support System (Smart CDSS) that takes input from diverse modalities, such as sensors, user profile information, social media, clinical knowledge bases, and medical experts to generate standards-based personalized recommendations. Smartphone-based, accelerometer-based, environment-based activity-recognition algorithms are developed with this system that recognizes users' daily life activities. For example, social media data are captured for a diabetic patient from his/her social interactions on Twitter, e-mail, and Trajectory and then combined with clinical observations from real encounters in health-care facilities. The input is converted into standard interface following HL7 vMR standards and submitted to the Smart CDSS for it to generate recommendations. We tested the system for 100 patients from Saint Mary's Hospital: 20 with type-1 diabetes, 40 with type-2 diabetes mellitus, and 40 with suspicions for diabetes but no diagnosis during clinical observations. The system knowledge base was initialized with standard guidelines from online resources for diabetes, represented in HL7 Arden syntax. The system generates recommendations based on physicians' guidelines provided at the hospital during patient follow-ups. With support from the Azure cloud infrastructure, the system executed the set of guidelines represented in Arden syntax in a reasonable amount of time. Scheduling and executing the 3--5 guidelines called medical logic modules (MLMs) required less than a second.",

abstract="Understanding activity patterns in office environments is important in order to increase workers' comfort and productivity. This paper proposes an automated system for discovering activity patterns of multiple persons in a work environment using a network of cheap low-resolution visual sensors (900 pixels). Firstly, the users' locations are obtained from a robust people tracker based on recursive maximum likelihood principles. Secondly, based on the users' mobility tracks, the high density positions are found using a bivariate kernel density estimation. Then, the hotspots are detected using a confidence region estimation. Thirdly, we analyze the individual's tracks to find the starting and ending hotspots. The starting and ending hotspots form an observation sequence, where the user's presence and absence are detected using three powerful Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). We describe two approaches to identify the user's status: a single model approach and a two-model mining approach. We evaluate both approaches on video sequences captured in a real work environment, where the persons' daily routines are recorded over 5 months. We show how the second approach achieves a better performance than the first approach. Routines dominating the entire group's activities are identified with a methodology based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. We also detect routines which are characteristic of persons. More specifically, we perform various analysis to determine regions with high variations, which may correspond to specific events.",

pages="347--364",
abstract="Targeting at modeling the high-level dynamics of pervasive computing systems, we introduce bond computing systems (BCS) consisting of objects, bonds and rules. Objects are typed but addressless representations of physical or logical (computing and communicating) entities. Bonds are typed multisets of objects. In a BCS, a configuration is specified by a multiset of bonds, called a collection. Rules specify how a collection evolves to a new one. A BCS is a variation of a P system introduced by Gheorghe Paun where, roughly, there is no maximal parallelism but with typed and unbounded number of membranes, and hence, our model is also biologically inspired. In this paper, we focus on regular bond computing systems (RBCS), where bond types are regular, and study their computation power and verification problems. Among other results, we show that the computing power of RBCS lies between linearly bounded automata (LBA) and LBC (a form of bounded multicounter machines) and hence, the regular bond-type reachability problem (given an RBCS, whether there is some initial collection that can reach some collection containing a bond of a given regular type) is undecidable. We also study a restricted model (namely, B-boundedness) of RBCS where the reachability problem becomes decidable.",

abstract="The increasing usage of smartphones in daily life has received considerable attention in academic and industry driven research to be utilized in the health sector. There has been development of a variety of health-related smartphone applications. Currently, however, there are few to none applications based on nurses' historical or behavioral preferences. Mobile application development for the health care sector requires extensive attention to security, reliability, and accuracy. In nursing applications, the users are often required to navigate in hospital environments, select patients to support, read the patient history and set action points to assist the patient during their shift. Finally, they have to report their performance on patient related activities and other relevant information before they leave for the day. In a working day, a nurse often visits different locations such as the patient's room, different laboratories, and offices for filling reports. There is still a limited capability to access context relevant information on a smartphone with minimal recourse such as Wi-Fi triangulation. The Wi-Fi triangulation signals fluctuate significantly for indoor location positioning. Therefore, providing relevant location based services to a mobile subscriber has become challenging. This paper addresses this gap by applying machine learning and behavior analysis to anticipate the potential location of the nurse and provide the required services. The application concept was already presented at the IMCOM 2015 conference. This paper focuses on the process to ascertain a user's context, the process of analyzing and predicting user behavior, and finally, the process of displaying the information through a dynamically generated UI.",

abstract="Official statistics data show that in many countries the population is aging. In addition, there are several illnesses and disabilities that also affect a small sector of the population. In recent years, researchers and medical foundations are working in order to develop systems based on new technologies and enhance the quality of life of them. One of the cheapest ways is to take advantage of the features provided by the smartphones. Nowadays, the development of reduced size smartphones, but with high processing capacity, has increased dramatically. We can take profit of the sensors placed in smartphones in order to monitor disabled and elderly people. In this paper, we propose a smart collaborative system based on the sensors embedded in mobile devices, which permit us to monitor the status of a person based on what is happening in the environment, but comparing and taking decisions based on what is happening to its neighbors. The proposed protocol for the mobile ad hoc network and the smart system algorithm are described in detail. We provide some measurements showing the decisions taken for several common cases and we also show the performance of our proposal when there is a medium size group of disabled or elderly people. Our proposal can also be applied to take care of children in several situations.",

abstract="For business demographers, a noteworthy aspect of national population aging is the course of its onset at local scales, such as neighborhoods and individual city blocks. Across the U. S., particular neighborhoods are evolving through aging in place into de facto retirement communities, populated by elderly residents who continue to live independently. An increasingly common manifestation of this development is the so-called naturally occurring retirement community (NORC)---a neighborhood where adults have stayed on and grown old while younger people have drifted away. NORCs materialize gradually over time where initial cohorts settle in close proximity and age in place, while subsequent younger cohorts move away. These settings offer novel opportunities for prolonging independent living in old age. They constitute distinctive readymade consumer markets as well, especially for businesses that rely on word of mouth. We present a general approach to spotting NORCs. We then consider such enclaves as potential target markets, both for community planners aiming to centralize service delivery to the elderly and for businesses offering types of services that can be bundled profitably for these residential concentrations of elderly.",

abstract="ICT solutions must meet the requirements demanded by challenging and complex scenarios such as remote care, which can be viewed as a combination of heterogeneous services using multimedia and home-care tools. Network Slicing emerged to this end, a paradigm tailoring the needs of any scenario whose specifications need to be met at all times. For its implementation, the network flexibility and resource control features provided by the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) techniques can allow the Network Slicing paradigm to manage the peculiarities established by any given scenario, taking a special consideration to multimedia scenarios with particular needs such as low latency and high bandwidth. However, existing Network Slicing approaches lack management mechanisms to understand when resources and services have to be changed or reconfigured to continue meeting the requirements, what elements would be involved in this updating process, and how changes would have to be performed. This article addresses this challenge by proposing an architecture able to manage the complete life cycle of Network Slices and to determine when, what, and how to dynamically orchestrate the resources and services so as to meet the scenario requirements. This SDN/NFV-enabled architecture allows managing the underlying infrastructure at run-time through policies, which use a formal Network Slicing information model based on ontologies also proposed in this article. Also, a complete use case is exercised to face the specific requirements of a given eHealth scenario with multimedia services, whose feasibility is demonstrated through a number of conducted experiments.",

These solutions have some deficiencies associated with the use of these models. To address this, a goal-oriented solution has been proposed. In a goal-oriented solution, goal models offer a method of flexibly modelling inhabitant activity. The flexibility of these goal models can dynamically produce a large number of varying action plans that may be used to guide inhabitants. In order to provide illustrative, video-based, instruction for these numerous actions plans, a number of video clips would need to be associated with each variation. To address this, rich metadata may be used to automatically match appropriate video clips from a video repository to each specific, dynamically generated, activity plan. This study introduces a mechanism of automatically generating suitable rich metadata representing actions depicted within video clips to facilitate such video matching. This performance of this mechanism was evaluated using eighteen video files; during this evaluation metadata was automatically generated with a high level of accuracy.",

abstract="Location-based services or smart home applications all depend on an accurate indoor positioning system. Basically one divides these systems into token-based and token-free localization systems. In this work, we focus on the token-free system based on smart floor technology. Smart floors can typically be built using pressure sensors or capacitive sensors. However, these set-ups are often hard to deploy as mechanical or electrical features are required below the surface and even harder to replace when detected a sensor malfunctioning. Therefore we present a novel indoor positioning system using an uncommon form of passive electric field sensing (EPS), which detects the electric potential variation caused by body movement. The EPS-based smart floor set-up is easy to install by deploying a grid of passive electrode wires underneath any non-conductive surfaces. Easy maintenance is also ensured by the fact that the sensors are not placed underneath the surface, but on the side. Due to the passive measuring nature, low power consumption is achieved as opposed to active capacitive measurement. Since we do not collect image data as in visual-based systems and all sensor data is processed locally, we preserve the user's privacy. The proposed architecture achieves a high position accuracy and an excellent spatial resolution. Based on our evaluation conducted in our living lab, we measure a mean positioning error of only 12.7 cm.",

abstract="During the first 15 years of this century, seven thousand people have been crushed to death in stampedes. Many would argue that these fatalities could have been prevented by better control and management. Crowd management today needs to minimise the chances of occurrence of stampedes, fires and other disasters and also to deal with the ongoing threat of terrorism and outbreak of communicable diseases like EBOLA, HIV Aids, Swine Influenza H1N1, H1N2, various strands of flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These challenges have created a need for using all available resources, especially modern tools and technology, when dealing with crowds. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), which is already benefiting many industrial and government organisations around the world, may be useful for scanning crowded locations and hence in helping to prevent overcrowding. Other wireless technologies should also be considered for possible use in crowded events. Ideally, some of the regular crowded event locations should be transformed into smart cities. In this article we shall discuss different kinds of crowds and technologies for their management. In particular, we shall analyse cases where wireless and mobile technologies can be utilised effectively. The Hajj, which has witnessed several stampedes, is chosen as the case study but most of our findings would be applicable in other events like the Kumbh Mela.",

Moreover, one specific UWB technology, namely Frequency Modulated (FM)-UWB, has also an important advantage, which make it even more convenient for medical applications, such as simple low cost design (FM, no receive LO, no carrier synchronization as in IR-UWB).

abstract="Analysis of human behaviour for deducing health and well-being information is one of the contemporary challenges given the ageing in place. To this end, existing and newly developed machine learning methods are needed to be evaluated using annotated real-world data sets. However, the metrics used in performance evaluation are directly taken from the machine learning domain, and they do not necessarily consider the specific needs of human behaviour analysis such as recognizing the duration, start time and frequency of the activities. Moreover, the commonly used metrics such as accuracy or F-measure can be misleading in the presence of skewed class distributions as in the case of human behaviour recognition. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning methods, hidden Markov model and time windowed neural network on five different real-world data sets through human behaviour understanding for health assessment perspective. According to the experimental results, standard metrics fail to reveal the actual performance of the two compared machine learning methods in terms of behaviour recognition. On the other hand, the proposed evaluation mechanism which considers three different activity categories leads to a more realistic evaluation of the overall performance.",

abstract="In this paper an agent-based simulation is developed in order to evaluate an Ambient Intelligence scenario based on agents. Many AmI applications are implemented through agents but they are not compared with any other existing alternative in order to evaluate the relative benefits of using them. The proposed simulation environment analyses such benefits using two evaluation criteria: First, measuring agent satisfaction of different types of desires along the execution. Second, measuring time savings obtained through a correct use of context information. In this paper an existing agent architecture, an ontology and a 12-steps protocol to provide AmI services in airports, is evaluated using the NetLogo simulation environment. In our NetLogo model we are considering scalability issues of this application domain but using FIPA and BDI extensions to be coherent with our previous works and our previous JADE implementation of them. The NetLogo model simulates an airport with agent `passengers' passing through several zones located in a specific order in a map: passport controls, check-in counters of airline companies, boarding gates, different types of shopping. Although the initial data in each simulation is generated randomly, and the model is just an approximation of real-world airports, the definition of this case of use of AmI through NetLogo agents opens an interesting way to evaluate the benefits of using AmI, which is a significant contribution to the final development of AmI systems.",

abstract="Pointing gestures are our natural way of referencing distant objects and thus widely used in HCI for controlling devices. Due to current pointing models' inherent inaccuracies, most of the systems using pointing gestures so far rely on visual feedback showing users where they point at. However, in many environments, e.g., smart homes, it is rarely possible to display cursors since most devices do not contain a display. Therefore, we raise the question of how to facilitate accurate pointing-based interaction in a cursorless context. In this paper we present two user studies showing that previous cursorless techniques are rather inaccurate as they lack important considerations about users' characteristics that would help in minimizing inaccuracy. We show that pointing accuracy could be significantly improved by acknowledging users' handedness and ocular dominance. In a first user study (n={\thinspace}33), we reveal the large effect of ocular dominance and handedness on human pointing behavior. Current ray-casting techniques neglect both ocular dominance and handedness as effects onto pointing behavior, precluding them from accurate cursorless selection. With a second user study (n={\thinspace}25), we show that accounting for ocular dominance and handedness yields to significantly more accurate selections compared to two previously published ray-casting techniques. This speaks for the importance of considering users' characteristics further to develop better selection techniques to foster more robust accurate selections.",

This paper intends to contribute to filling this gap and presents a series of guidelines for designing systems that could effectively support caregivers in tasks such as monitoring ALF inhabitants, attending to their assistance requests and managing notes and reminders regarding daily activities.

Therefore, we proposed the HEMS (Household Effects Management System) which is used to remind family members to take their effects. Because we believe that the size of RFID tags will be smaller enough to be embedded on the household effects, we designed and implemented the HEMS based on RFID and OSGi.

SAGE Publications, Thousand Oaks, 2014, p. xix). This attention to the work that has fallen through the cracks is a move to engage the central tenets of Humanizing Research, but it's also a call to think critically with and through the failures that emerge in work with youth. We attend specifically to an ongoing failure in our work as a way to think about the kinds of promises that are often made and broken in participatory action research. In doing so, we tease out the implications of our work with youth and the steps community-based researchers can take to navigate the challenges that can impede the goals of fostering meaningful change.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) is advocated as technological solutions that will enable the elderly population maintain their independence for a longer time than would otherwise be the case. Though the facts motivating the need for AAL are indisputable, the inherently heterogeneous nature and requirements of the elderly population raise significant difficulties. One particular challenge is that of designing AAL systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and circumstances change. This demands the availability of an adaptive, open, scalable software platform that incorporates a select combination of autonomic and intelligent techniques. Given that the first generation of AAL systems will be deployed in the near future, it is incumbent on designers to factor this need for evolution and adaptivity in their designs and implementations. Thus this paper explores AAL from a number of prospective and considers an agent-based middleware approach to realising an architecture for evolutionary AAL.",

Furthermore, the efficiency, user acceptability, strategies and recommendations on improving current ECG monitoring systems with an overview of the design and modelling are presented. In this paper, over 120 ECG monitoring systems were reviewed and classified into smart wearable, wireless, mobile ECG monitoring systems with related signal processing algorithms. The results of the review suggest that most research in wearable ECG monitoring systems focus on the older adults and this technology has been adopted in aged care facilitates. Moreover, it is shown that how mobile telemedicine systems have evolved and how advances in wearable wireless textile-based systems could ensure better quality of healthcare delivery. The main drawbacks of deployed ECG monitoring systems including imposed limitations on patients, short battery life, lack of user acceptability and medical professional's feedback, and lack of security and privacy of essential data have been also discussed.",

However, with the increase of life expectancy, also the type of needs change due to an increase of co-morbidity and multi-chronic conditions asking for an increased focus on the patient as a whole rather than the individual diseases. Recent technological advances provide new opportunities for technical solutions that interact with end users and the utilization of robots is considered one potential mean for addressing this challenge. This article outlines the changes in the demands, with particular examples taken from the Danish health care system as an example, together with the technological achievements within the robotics domain. We identify where technologies that to a large degree are existing already today can be utilized to support the social systems in the near future. We show that several of the challenges related to the demographic change can be addressed with technology that is already available and that for some cases have reached the mass market already. We also outline the to be expected opportunities and challenges in the development of future robots in the health-care domain.",

abstract="Ubiquitous computing environments advocate creating applications by plugging together various resources (mobile devices, displays, augmented everyday objects, and so on) and Web Services to support the user's everyday activities and needs. This approach is referred to as application composition, and such applications are called composite. Due to the dynamic nature of ubiquitous environments, application composition has to be supported at runtime, so that the applications are able to adapt to the situation within the environment and other contexts. Application composition is usually performed by autonomous context-aware mechanisms that provide limited or no control for users. Still, users need to be aware of their environments and be able to control and configure applications when they are composed and executed. Towards this goal we present in this article a context-aware application composition system based on the iCompose interface for composing and controlling applications at runtime. Users compose applications by simply touching the resources in the environment with their mobile devices, while the iCompose interface provides feedback and assists users by suggesting them possible further actions. The interface relies on a rule-based reasoner and utilizes various context sources to support users dynamically, according to the situation in which they compose applications. We present a complete implementation of the system and report the results of a user evaluation study conducted with 21 participants. This study assesses the issues of control, usability, feasibility and user acceptance of the iCompose interface for context-aware application composition and the prototype as a whole.",

abstract="Dementia care is becoming increasingly important in Japan as the elderly population grows. Care homes are designed so that caregivers can easily observe and subsequently respond to the needs of people with dementia. However, the layout of care homes can become overly restrictive for residents, for example, by not providing intermediate spaces where people can spontaneously interact and initiate conversations. We present a case study that explores the implementation of video monitoring in two purpose-built care homes in which we were asked to help overcome the blind spots presented by the layout. We collected data both before and after the implementation of the video monitoring in order to understand its effect. The balance between people's sense of security and the concerns about loss of privacy through video monitoring is well established. However, we found that video monitoring had a beneficial effect on both the caregivers and the residents if implemented sensitively. Furthermore, the implementation of video monitoring could support the design of more beneficial care home layouts. In conclusion, we propose that the sensitive implementation of video monitoring be considered alongside design of the physical layout of care homes.",

However, privacy concerns about having 24/7 monitoring, especially video monitoring, in the home environment have been cited as a major barrier in the design of home monitoring systems. In this paper we describe the design and evaluation of ``DigiSwitch'', a medical system designed to allow older adults to view information as it is collected about them and temporarily cease transmission of data for privacy reasons. Results from a series of iterative user studies suggest that control over the transmission of monitoring data from the home is helpful for maintaining user privacy. The studies demonstrate that older adults are able to use the DigiSwitch system to monitor and direct the collection and transmission of health information in their homes, providing these participants with a way to simultaneously maintain privacy and benefit from home monitoring technology.",

abstract="The era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has changed the world of the ageing population. Elderly people do not wish to live as they did in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Instead, their desire is to live independently in their own home and continue to practice all activities. However, the cost of taking care of elderly people is a challenge for both the present and in the future. Indeed, the number of elderly people in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is increasing rapidly from 5 {\%} to 20.9 {\%} by 2050. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technology is advocated to improve the quality of life, provide the elderly with services and technologies that support them in their daily activities, help them to live longer and independently in their homes. The aims of this paper are to explore the barriers and challenges of AAL by identifying the barriers that restrict the adoption of these technologies in KSA and to provide a quantitative analysis based on the results of a survey. The results show that there are many factors that influence the adoption and use of AAL technologies by elderly Saudi Arabians and provide an insight for solutions to support them in independent living.",

Our assessments are based on results of a written survey questionnaire and a statistical analysis using `The Design Literacy assessment tool'. Our analysis suggest that participating students have internalized basic knowledge about design, but lack adaptive aspects of design literacy, specifically the capability to take a designerly stance towards inquiry when confronted with `wicked problems'. We suggest that, due to societal developments, students are becoming more `design literate', but that they generally develop routine expertise in these first practical encounters with design processes, whereas the more complex adaptive capabilities demand more education of both students and teachers.",

Mobile robots are used in active service for the assisted living of elderly people, monitoring their mental and physiological data with wireless sensor nodes. The data collected from sensor nodes are routed back to a sink node through multi-hop communication. The moving sink node installed on the main controller of the robot collects data and transmits it to the main controller. To be able to handle emergency situations, the robot needs to satisfy real-time requirements when processing the data collected, and invoking tasks to execute. This paper realizes a multi-hop sensor network and proposes real-time software architecture based on Xenomai. The real-time tasks were implemented, with priority, to rapidly respond to urgent sensor data. In order to validate the deterministic response of the proposed system, the performance measurements for the delay in handling the sensed data transmission and the trajectory control with a feedback loop were evaluated on the non real-time standard Linux.",

abstract="Robots have begun to assist elders and patients suffering dementia. In particular, recent studies have shown how robots can benefit Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This is a novel area with a promising future but lot of researching needs to be done. The RobAlz project is aimed to assist AD patients and their caregivers by social robots. This project is divided in three phases: the definition of the requirements and scenarios, the development of a new robotic platform, and the evaluation. This work presents the results obtained in the first phase, in which several meetings were conducted with a set of subject-matter experts in the areas of Alzheimer's Disease and social robotics. The meetings were classified according to the application areas they covered: general aspects, safety, entertainment, personal assistance, and stimulation. The meetings ended up with a repertory of scenarios where robots can be applied to Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers at their home or in longterm care facilities. These scenarios present different psychological, social and technical concerns that must be addressed for the design of the robot. In this work we perform an analysis on the scenarios and present the technical requirements for the development of a first robotic prototype. This prototype will be constructed and tested in real environments in the subsequent phases of the RobAlz project.",

A number of evaluation exercises were undertaken throughout the project's development, including user-participative workshops and focus groups. This paper focuses on the summative usability evaluation exercise, which comprised a laboratory-based study in a simulated home environment, with a view to determining the appropriateness of employing this approach with potentially vulnerable participants. The study involved 27 participants interacting with the user interface. Their behaviour was observed and recorded, and their interaction with the system was analysed. They were also given a post-session questionnaire, where their opinions of the usability of the interface were solicited. The results of the usability testing were positive, and insight has been gained into how products of this nature can be further improved. The experience of conducting laboratory-based studies with vulnerable users was positive and led to propose in this paper a set of guidelines for future work in evaluating usability for work in this domain.",

SSP depends heavily on the existence of comprehensive multimodal databases containing the descriptors of social context and behaviors, such as situational environment, roles and gender of human participants. In the recent paper SSP community has emphasized how current research lacks of the adequate data, for the greatest part because acquisition and annotation of large multimodal datasets are time- and resource-consuming for the researchers. This paper aims to collect the existing work in this scope and to deliver the key aspects and clear directions for managing the multimodal behavior data. It reviews some of the existing databases, gives their important characteristics and draws the most important tools and methods conducted in capturing and managing social behavior signals.

The applications developed take advantage of the smartphone-embedded inertial sensors and require that subjects wear the smartphone by means of a waist belt. The uFall Android application has been developed for monitoring the user's motor activities at home. The application does not require any direct interaction with the user and it is also capable of running a real-time fall-detection algorithm. uTUG is a stand-alone application for instrumenting the Timed Up and Go test, which is a test often included in fall risk assessment protocols. The application acts like a pocket-sized motion laboratory, since it is capable not only of recording the trial but also of processing the data and immediately displaying the results. uTUG is designed to be self-administrable at home.",

abstract="As various biomedical electronic devices supported by different network protocols are springing up in our living space, many development and researches focus on building a digital biomedical system by using modern techniques. To realize such a theme, the system architecture supporting biomedical services in a health care center should include a broker built in a single computer or an embedded system to coordinate various devices. The main challenge is how the future-proof biomedical devices can be easily integrated into the system. In this paper, we propose a practical skeleton to build a personal biomedical sensing system featuring integrability, extendibility and flexibility. The construction guidelines in the skeleton can ease the development and maintenance for developers. A practically realized case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed skeleton. Besides, the proposed scheduling scheme can stabilize the biomedical sensor messages. The period of sending messages could be changeable based on the shortest processing time rule. From the experimental results, the proposed scheme can reduce the waiting time and stabilize messages from biomedical sensors. The central control broker is very essential to handle the main process in the proposed scheme and to control the scheduling scheme of four biomedical sensors used in this research.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living applications are very much dependent on robust activity recognition frameworks, which allow these applications to provide services based on the contextual information that has been discovered. Existing frameworks have generally focused on the application of traditional classifiers and semantics reasoning to recognize activities. Nevertheless, being able to recognize unexpected actions remains a challenge. The work in this paper presents an approach that is able to recognize activities that have been conducted in an unordered manner. The recognition framework extends an existing approach that recognizes activities by exploiting the different levels of abstraction within an activity. A frequent pattern mining algorithm has been applied to the recognition framework in order to find patterns within the stream of captured events, which in turn increases the adaptive learning ability of the proposed recognition framework. This paper also presents experimental results that validate the recognition ability of the recognition framework. The motivation of this work is to be able to detect the functional decline among elderly people suffering from Alzheimer's disease by recognizing their daily activities.",

Since urban green spaces affect the quality of life and provide various ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits to a city, the spatial distribution of UGSs and per capita availability deserve greater consideration in urban planning and research. The UGSs are extracted from freely available Sentinel 2 image with spatial resolutions of 10 m (blue, green, red, and near infrared bands). The result indicates that the planned urban setups have higher area under UGSs as compared to the rest of the city. Analysis and intra-city comparison (ward wise) of distribution of green spaces and per capita availability indicate that there is an inequitable distribution of UGSs in Bathinda City. The study also attempts to accentuate the scope of green initiatives in the various wards of the city to ensure the well-being of people.",

abstract="The new digital health innovations have opened up several opportunities to help the clinicians, patients and other caregivers of rheumatology healthcare system in maximizing efficiencies resulting in better patient outcomes. In the global context, digital health technology has the potential to bridge the distance gap between all the key stakeholders involved in rheumatology health care. In this review, we update on the recent advances in the field of digital health and highlight unique features of these technologies which would help in routine care. Application of technology in any form to enable, facilitate or enhance the quality of care is the foundation of digitised care. The components could be smartphone apps, sensors, video, social media platforms or messenger platforms, wearables or a combination of these enabling healthcare delivery and overcoming the constraints of distance, location and time. Digital therapeutics have started evolving and an important step in this direction is the involvement of FDA in the approval process. Speciality specific apps, personalised patient education as per disease status, remote specialist consultations or virtual health coach to guide on lifestyle modifications are some of the developments which have been facilitated by increased digitization in all walks of life. Assisted care with the help of robots rendering care in the hospitals or an intelligent robot guiding a patient by voice and visual sense at home are already at the threshold of entering the mainstream of patient care. Wearable devices equipped with powerful sensors are coming handy in keeping a watch on patient symptoms all the time and providing useful insights on disease progression, clinical response or complications. In chronic care such as rheumatology the implications, possibilities and benefits seem unprecedented. Real time data analytics and artificial intelligence are helping the clinicians, healthcare systems and policy makers optimise the resources and improve patient outcomes. Digitization of healthcare has gained momentum in the recent years and it is envisaged that it could be a catalyst to change, bridge the quality of care and most important democratise the healthcare access across the globe. However, more data, efficacy and objective results are needed which would be fulfilled by ongoing observational studies, clinical trials, systematic review and meta-analysis to further establish the role of digital health in the realms of patient care.",

Then, given multiple alternatives for providing the same type of context, the middleware applies the utility function to each alternative and choose the one with maximum utility. By allowing applications to delegate the selection of context source to the middleware, our middleware can implement autonomic properties, such as self-configuration when new context providers appear and resilience to failures of context providers.",

In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we survey and assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics.

abstract="A hierarchical human activity recognition (HAR) system is proposed to recognize abnormal activities from the daily life activities of elderly people living alone. The system is structured to have two-levels of feature extraction and activity recognition. The first level consists of R-transform, kernel discriminant analysis (KDA), {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-means algorithm and HMM to recognize the video activity. The second level consists of KDA, {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-means algorithm and HMM, and is selectively applied to the recognized activities from the first level when it belongs to the specified group. The proposed hierarchical approach is useful in increasing the recognition rate for the highly similar activities. System performance is analyzed by selecting the optimized number of features, number of HMM states and the number of frames per second to achieve maximum recognition rate. The system is validated by a novel set of six abnormal activities; falling backward, falling forward, chest pain, headache, vomiting, and fainting and a normal activity walking. Experimental results show an average recognition rate of 97.1 {\%} for all the activities by using the proposed hierarchical HAR system.",

abstract="This is a study of the visions and expectations which have been put forward by experts about smart grids. Within the sociology of expectation, such visions are given performative significance, and as such these expectations can provide us with an idea of where smart grid development is intended to take us. In order to gain insight into these issues, this paper first undertakes a literature review of 40 smart grid research papers. Thereafter, the paper reviews the self-reporting of 19 smart grid demo projects within the ERA-Net research framework of the EU. The findings suggest that there are three distinct expert smart grid narratives about users, one economic, one technical, and one which consists of a social science critique. The first one seeks to facilitate for user rationality by economic incentives, whereas the second seeks largely to automate the consumption and thereby bypass the question of active users. Social science critique is found to evaluate imagined users and their potential correspondence with real ones. When actual failure of economic incentives is recorded in demo sites, the economic rationale narrative exhibits surprising resilience within the frameworks. Technical narratives reinforce the argument for bypassing the user with the aid of technology, thereby suggesting performativity at work. The discussion raises the question of the actual and perceived need for active users in the smart grid, and suggests that strategies for non-participation of end users in the smart grid are both relevant and necessary.",

abstract="We describe a methodology for creating new technologies for assisted living in residential environments. The number of eldercare clients is expected to grow dramatically over the next decade as the baby boom generation approaches 65 years of age. The UMass/Smith ASSIST framework aims to alleviate the strain on centralized medical providers and community services as their clientele grow, reduce the delays in service, support independent living, and therefore, improve the quality of life for the up-coming elder population. We propose a closed loop methodology wherein innovative technical systems are field tested in assisted care facilities and analyzed by social scientists to create and refine residential systems for independent living. Our goal is to create technology that is embraced by clients, supports efficient delivery of support services, and facilitates social interactions with family and friends. We introduce a series of technologies that are currently under evaluation based on a distributed sensor network and a unique mobile manipulator (MM) concept. The mobile manipulator provides client services and serves as an embodied interface for remote service providers. As a result, a wide range of cost-effective eldercare applications can be devised, several of which are introduced in this paper. We illustrate tools for social interfaces, interfaces for community service and medical providers, and the capacity for autonomous assistance in the activities of daily living. These projects and others are being considered for field testing in the next cycle of ASSIST technology development.",

abstract="An iSpace is an environment that offers services to its inhabitants, such as re-routing communications, displaying information, adapting climate controls or monitoring their well-being. One main objective for iSpaces is awareness, i.e. the available services and devices of the iSpace must be aware of inhabitants and their contexts and intentions. In order to obtain the required information an iSpace can use a logical sensor network that allows abstracting from the physical implementation of sensors and provides the data for an automatic intelligent data analysis (IDA). In this paper we describe an approach to automatic IDA in the context of sensor networks and give an example from the telecare area, where the iSpace is represented by a sensor-rigged home of a person whose well-being needs to be monitored in the context of social care.",

abstract="This article presents a method for measuring the quality of interaction in social mobile robotic telepresence. The methodology is in part based on Adam Kendon's theory of F-formations. The theory is based on observations of how bodies naturally orient themselves during interaction between people in real life settings. In addition, two presence questionnaires (Temple Presence Inventory and Networked Minds Social Presence Inventory), designed to measure the users' perceptions of others and the environment when experienced through a communication medium are used. The perceived presence and ease of use are correlated to the spatial formations between the robot and an actor. The proposed methodology is validated experimentally on a dataset consisting of interactions between an elder (actor) and 21 different users being trained in piloting a mobile robotic telepresence unit. The evaluation has shown that these tools are suitable for evaluating mobile robotic telepresence and also that correlations between the tools used exist. Further, these results give important guidelines on how to improve the interface in order to increase the quality of interaction.",

abstract="Volunteered geographic information (VGI), or geospatial crowdsourcing, is where citizens (volunteers) contribute data and information about the earth and environment that is explicitly or implicitly georeferenced and then disseminated via collaborative projects such as OpenStreetMap or social media such as Flickr, Twitter, and Facebook. VGI popularity is due in no small part to citizens making use of consumer devices, such as smartphones, to collect increasingly precise locational information and other environmental information. In this paper we describe the potential for using VGI in pervasive health computing applications. Pervasive health computing strives to provide healthcare (services or information) to anyone, at anytime, and anywhere by removing constraints of time and location. We use the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project as a case--study of a very successful VGI project. We analyse the strengths of OSM, its current applicability to pervasive health computing, and if it is a sustainable option for use as a source of spatial information for pervasive computing technologies, particularly in areas where access to information on healthcare services is limited or difficult. The paper closes by summarizing the advantages and challenges of VGI integration into pervasive health computing and outlining some of the key issues where further cross-disciplinary research is required.",

Interaction with auto-discovered target devices present in the environment (e.g., the air conditioning of a hotel) is not so easy since devices may provide inaccessible user interfaces (e.g., in a foreign language that the user cannot understand). Scalability for multiple concurrent users and response times are still problems in this domain. In this paper, we assess an interoperable architecture, which enables interaction between people with some kind of special need and their environment. The assessment, based on performance patterns and antipatterns, tries to detect performance issues and also tries to enhance the architecture design for improving system performance. As a result of the assessment, the initial design changed substantially. We refactorized the design according to the Fast Path pattern and The Ramp antipattern. Moreover, resources were correctly allocated. Finally, the required response time was fulfilled in all system scenarios. For a specific scenario, response time was reduced from 60 seconds to less than 6 seconds.",

abstract="It is challenging to identify potential patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the emergency department (ED), although these cases should immediately undergo further evaluation in the observation unit. This study aimed to establish a new and rapid assessment system for triaging patients with potential ACS in the ED. Data from 1022 cases (June 2012--August 2015) were evaluated using latent class analysis to identify key symptoms and medical histories. Significant variables in the latent class analysis were entered as predictors for the new triaging system, and the final model was selected based on the false alarm rate, hit rate, and discriminability index. The new system provided better discriminability and significantly reduced the false alarm rate, compared to conventional methods. Our results indicate that symptom clustering analysis can facilitate the identification of potential ACS cases using a risk stratification system in the ED. The symptom clustering may facilitate a rapid assessment tool that reduces the costs of unnecessary diagnosis and hospitalization. Furthermore, this system might be developed as an application for embedding in ambient assisted living homes.",

The objective of this survey paper is to outline the different types of video datasets and highlights their merits and demerits under practical considerations. Based on the available information inside the dataset we can categorise these datasets into RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) and RGB-D(depth). The most prominent challenges involved in these datasets are occlusions, illumination variation, view variation, annotation, and fusion of modalities. The key specification of these datasets is discussed such as resolutions, frame rate, actions/actors, background, and application domain. We have also presented the state-of-the-art algorithms in a tabular form that give the best performance on such datasets. In comparison with earlier surveys, our works give a better presentation of datasets on the well-organised comparison, challenges, and latest evaluation technique on existing datasets.",

abstract="Various media access control (MAC) protocols have been developed to deal with the heterogenous traffic in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In many emerging applications, it is regarded essential to prioritize the heterogeneous traffic for reliable performance of WSN. This work categorizes the recently developed traffic prioritization MAC protocols in the classes of `Adaptive Contention', `Duty-Cycle Adaptation', `Queue Management' and `Hybrid'. A taxonomy has been developed based on the categorization and detailed overview of each protocol is presented. The performance benefits and gaps are described for each of the protocols and the future research directions are suggested based on the analysis. It has been identified that most of the existing MAC protocols, although provide early channel access to high priority traffic, fail to offer true preemptive priority. There exists no mechanism which could pause/interrupt the ongoing transmission of the low priority traffic to facilitate the immediate channel access for high priority data. The analysis provided by this article is expected to aid the future researchers in identifying the trends of MAC protocol development in the context of traffic prioritization.",

The performances of such system depend on both the feature extraction (FE) and the classification stages in the context of streaming data. In the context of streaming and high imbalanced data, this paper proposes and evaluates three FE methods in conjunction with five classification techniques. Our results on public smart home streaming data show better performances for our proposed methods comparing to the state-of-the-art baseline techniques in terms of classification accuracy, F-measure and computational time. Test on Aruba Database show an improvement in term of accuracy and computation time of the results when using the proposed method, using a KNN-based classifier (both around 87 {\%} of correct classification but with a largely higher computing time for SVM).",

Then, hybrid features as optical flow motion features and distance parameters features are extracted from the depth silhouette region and used in an augmented form to work as patiotemporal features. In order to represent each activity in a better way, the augmented features are being clustered and symbolized by self-organization maps. Finally, these features are then processed by hidden Markov models to train and recognize human activities based on transition and emission probabilities values.

abstract="The goal of this study is to explore and evaluate the use of a hybrid ARIMA-SVR approach to forecast daily radiology emergency patient flow. Owing to the fact that emergency patient flow is highly uncertain and dynamic, the forecasting problem is regarded as a complicated task. As the emergency patient flow may have both linear and nonlinear patterns, this paper presents a hybrid ARIMA-SVR approach, which hybridizes autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and support vector regression (SVR) model to predict emergency patient arrivals. The proposed model is applied to 4 years of daily emergency visits data in the radiology department of a large hospital to justify the performance of the hybrid model against single models. The MAPE, RMSE and MAE of the hybrid model are 7.02{\%}, 19.20 and 14.97, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieves better prediction performance than its competitors because it can capture the linear and nonlinear patterns simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid ARIMA-SVR approach is a promising alternative for forecasting emergency patient flow. These findings are beneficial for efficient patient flow management and scheduling decisions optimization.",

During gesture spotting, a dynamic time warping is applied and the aligning costs to a set of pre-selected gesture sub-classes are thresholded to determine possible detections. The outputs of the two modules are combined in a late-fusion fashion. The system is validated in a real-case scenario with elderly from an elder home.

Detection of repetitive actions has been based on the analysis of a person's trajectory using the principles of signal correlation. Along with the ability to detect repetitive motion the developed approach also has the ability to measure the amount of activity/inactivity within the scene during a given period of time. Our results showed that the developed approach had the ability to detect all patterns in the data set examined with an average accuracy of 96.67{\%}.

However, understanding why, and when such solutions have to be adopted is often unanswered because the answer comes only from a broader perspective, accounting for legal and organizational issues. Security engineers and legal experts should analyze the business goals of a company and its organizational structure and derive from there the points where security and privacy problems may arise and which solutions best fit such (legal) problems. The paper investigates the methodological support for capturing security and privacy requirements of a concrete health care provider.",

abstract="Body Area Networks integrated into mHealth systems are becoming a mature technology with unprecedented opportunities for personalized health monitoring and management. Potential applications include early detection of abnormal conditions, supervised rehabilitation, and wellness management. Such integrated mHealth systems can provide patients with increased confidence and a better quality of life, and promote healthy behavior and health awareness. Automatic integration of collected information and user's inputs into research databases can provide medical community with opportunity to search for personalized trends and group patterns, allowing insights into disease evolution, the rehabilitation process, and the effects of drug therapy. A new generation of personalized monitoring systems will allow users to customize their systems and user interfaces and to interact with their social networks. With emergence of first commercial body area network systems, a number of system design issues are still to be resolved, such as seamless integration of information and ad-hoc interaction with ambient sensors and other networks, to enable their wider acceptance. In this paper we present state of technology, discuss promising new trends, opportunities and challenges of body area networks for ubiquitous health monitoring applications.",

At the object level, we used computational color model for efficient object segmentation and tracking to handle dynamic background change in indoor environment. To make it computationally efficient, cosine of the angle between the expected image color vector and current image color vector is used. At feature level, we have presented a linear predictive coding of histogram of directional derivative as a spatio-temporal descriptor. Our proposed descriptor describes the local object shape and appearance within cuboids effectively and distinctively. A multiclass support vector machine has been used to classify the human activities. The proposed framework for recognition of indoor human activity has been extensively validated on the benchmark of ADL datasets, with a focus that this methodology is robust and attains more precise human activity recognition rate as compared to current methodologies available.",

Thus, the development of these systems demands a context-aware, open, scalable, and distributed software technology that incorporates both intelligent and autonomic reconfiguration techniques.

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to estimate the strength of the upper limb muscles of a stroke patient by using Microsoft Kinect sensor. A prototype exergame is designed and developed to mimic real post-stroke rehabilitation exercises. Least-square regression matrix is used to find the relation between the kinematics of the upper limb and the strength of the corresponding muscles. Kinect sensor is used along with a force sensing resistors (FSR) glove and two straps to collect both, real-time upper limb joints data and the strength of muscles of the subjects while they are performing the exercises. The prototype of this system is tested on five stroke patients and eight healthy subjects. Results show that there is no statistically significant difference between the measured and the estimated values of the upper-limb muscles of the stroke patients. Thus, the proposed method is useful in estimating the strength of the muscles of stroke patient without the need to wear any devices.",

abstract="A tweet, possessing various facets, is created at the speed of thought, propagated in real time and produces social interchange on an international scale. As a result, users demand the analysis of twitter mining with a map to search for trendy topics or find what is being talked about among users. Due to the sparsity of location information, however, there are real difficulties in analysis related to position information. To run Twitter mining on all Korean users, this study used firehose level, which is massive 100 {\%} twitter data, while utilizing a new spatial indicator to overcome the sparsity of location information. Furthermore, the study suggested an algorithm to process firehose data and solutions to overcome the study's limit. The conventional method of using spritzer level data and the supervised method resulted in 44 times more positions inferred on a tweet than the method using geotag, whereas the method used in this study saw inferences rise 680 fold. In the case of the clustering algorithm, the method of K-Center Clustering was found to have inferred the most number of user residential locations. The ultimate goal of the study is for the twitter data, including the massive volume of location information inferred and created in real time, to serve as a means of city monitoring by overcoming the study's limit, which is automated refining of unnecessary words for profile location information and twitter mining.",

abstract="Current IT market has increased significantly boosted by the development of network technology and IT technology. As we move into an aging society, global people have paid attentions to the matters related to health while the many technologies related to health have been developed, too. Such a change of social paradigm has improved the quality of life but various mental diseases show its growing trend. The past mental disease matters were limited to the area of chronic mental disease patients, but recently light mental diseases including the stress caused by excessive work and internet addiction are included in this area. Especially there are many cases where early treatable depressions have been developed into the serious diseases as they had no chance to recognition and healing or missed the appropriate time for healing. Even if various health related mobile services to solve this show it gradual growing trend now, providing services which correspond to the needs of users, are difficult in the actual situation, while many researches are performed to provide the customized service by utilizing PHR but they are very vulnerable in the aspect of security. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the context aware based user customized light therapy service using security framework. The proposed service applied the context aware based security framework to enhance the security of health service for PHR interlocking, which can protect the medical information by complying with standard based encryption, security guideline. For this purpose, we arranged that object group support component of DOGF should be existed in server system and components such as user information and distributed sources re-composed by smart health for service providing. Based on this, the user's states was analyzed in real time through Personal Health Record and Galvanic Skin Response of users, the brightness and chromaticity of bulb was adjusted depending on the states of user for soothing effect, the real-time states was figured out through questionnaires for mental states analysis of smartphone application to provide the real-time treatment for users stress alleviating and concentration enhancement. Also focused on Psychological illness, we arranged to provide the real-time light therapy according to the states of users based on the data of patients collected from smart device in order to mental disease prevention and treatment caused from the stress of workers who work with computer for a long time such as office workers, program developer and home workers.",

abstract="This paper presents a new approach to prioritize ``Large-scale Data'' of patients with chronic heart diseases by using body sensors and communication technology during disasters and peak seasons. An evaluation matrix is used for emergency evaluation and large-scale data scoring of patients with chronic heart diseases in telemedicine environment. However, one major problem in the emergency evaluation of these patients is establishing a reasonable threshold for patients with the most and least critical conditions. This threshold can be used to detect the highest and lowest priority levels when all the scores of patients are identical during disasters and peak seasons. A practical study was performed on 500 patients with chronic heart diseases and different symptoms, and their emergency levels were evaluated based on four main measurements: electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation sensor, blood pressure monitoring, and non-sensory measurement tool, namely, text frame. Data alignment was conducted for the raw data and decision-making matrix by converting each extracted feature into an integer. This integer represents their state in the triage level based on medical guidelines to determine the features from different sources in a platform. The patients were then scored based on a decision matrix by using multi-criteria decision-making techniques, namely, integrated multi-layer for analytic hierarchy process (MLAHP) and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). For subjective validation, cardiologists were consulted to confirm the ranking results. For objective validation, mean{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}standard deviation was computed to check the accuracy of the systematic ranking. This study provides scenarios and checklist benchmarking to evaluate the proposed and existing prioritization methods. Experimental results revealed the following. (1) The integration of TOPSIS and MLAHP effectively and systematically solved the patient settings on triage and prioritization problems. (2) In subjective validation, the first five patients assigned to the doctors were the most urgent cases that required the highest priority, whereas the last five patients were the least urgent cases and were given the lowest priority. In objective validation, scores significantly differed between the groups, indicating that the ranking results were identical. (3) For the first, second, and third scenarios, the proposed method exhibited an advantage over the benchmark method with percentages of 40{\%}, 60{\%}, and 100{\%}, respectively. In conclusion, patients with the most and least urgent cases received the highest and lowest priority levels, respectively.",

The proposed approach relies on a membership histogram descriptor that encodes the visual properties of the video frames. This descriptor is obtained by mapping the original low-level visual features to a more discriminative descriptor using possibilistic memberships. This mapping can be summarized in two main phases. The first one consists in categorizing the low-level visual features of the video frames and generating homogeneous clusters in an unsupervised way. The second phase uses the obtained membership degrees generated by the clustering process to compute the membership based histogram descriptor (MHD). For the testing stage, the proposed fall detection approach categorizes unlabeled videos as ``Fall'' or ``Non-Fall'' scene using a possibilistic K-nearest neighbors classifier. The proposed approach is assessed using standard videos dataset that simulates patient fall. Also, we compare its performance with that of state-of-the-art fall detection techniques.",

Unlike wired networks, wireless networks are subject to more packet loss and congestion. In this paper, we propose a congestion control and service prioritization protocol for real time monitoring of patients' vital signs using wireless biomedical sensor networks. The proposed system is able to discriminate between physiological signals and assign them different priorities. Thus, it would be possible to provide a better quality of service for transmitting highly important vital signs. Congestion control is performed by considering both the congestion situation in the parent node and the priority of the child nodes in assigning network bandwidth to signals from different patients. Given the dynamic nature of patients' health conditions, the proposed system can detect an anomaly in the received vital signs from a patient and hence assign more priority to patients in need. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed protocol. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at a special-purpose congestion control protocol specifically designed for wireless biosensor networks.",

abstract="The basic concept of a smart space (SS) is to be aware of the context information related to environmental and human behavioral changes, and to provide appropriate services accordingly. To obtain context information, we may use video cameras, microphones, and other monitoring devices. Although these devices can obtain complex environmental data, they are not suitable for building private smart space (PSS) because of the privacy issue. Human users do not like being monitored in their private spaces. In this study, we investigate the possibility of recognizing certain activities using binary data collected by using infrared sensors. Infrared sensors have been used mainly for detecting the existence/absence of the residents in a region of interest. Here, we consider four types of activities, namely, No-Activity, Very-Weak-Activity, Weak-Activity, and Strong-Activity. Our main goal is to provide a way for building PSS using low-cost and non-privacy-sensitive devices. We have conducted some primary experiments by collecting user activity information using binary infrared sensors. Generally speaking, activity related sensor data are sensitive to various factors. To effectively address this issue, we propose a recognition method based on fuzzy decision tree. The results of the primary experiments show that the recognition rate of proposed method can be as high as 85.49{\%}. The results are encouraging, and show the possibility of building PSS using binary infrared sensors.",

abstract="For many years the introduction of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in medical practice has been considered the best way to provide efficient document sharing among different organizational settings. The actual results of these technologies, though, do not seem to have matched expectations. The issue of document sharing has been lately readdressed by proposing the creation of patient-controlled information and communication technologies, Personal Health Records (PHRs), providing laypeople the tools to access, manage and share their health information electronically by connecting to the existing EHRs and other institutional information systems. In this scenario, patients are called to play a major role in coordinating healthcare professionals by providing them the information they need. From a CSCW perspective the PHR offers an interesting case to reflect on cooperative work that requires new infrastructures that intersect organizational settings and extend into domestic environments. So far though, there has not been enough research to shed light on the self-care activities carried out in the households and how these integrate with the organizational practices of doctors and institutions. Our analyses show that health record keeping is an articulation work necessary for meetings with doctors to proceed smoothly. To do so, people integrate the information contained in medical documents by working on them with annotations, underlinings and integrations. Moreover, we show that health record keeping is a spatialized activity that is inextricably interwoven with the everyday routine and objects. Finally, we provide a tentative classification of three different strategies laypeople use to sort out health records: minimum effort, adaptive, networking.",

abstract="Telemedicine has been acknowledged to improve the quality of healthcare. However, many telemedicine services fail beyond the pilot phase. A literature review on business model components for telemedicine services was conducted. Based on specified inclusion criteria, 22 publications were included in the review. To facilitate the analysis of literature, a business model framework with value as its central focus was proposed. Improvement in quality, efficiency and accessibility of care were identified to be the outcomes of telemedicine, with patients and healthcare personnel being the main users of the services, which are delivered through home, institutional and community-based care. Patients, health providers, vendors, payers and government agencies are actors involved in the delivery of telemedicine services, which require investments in resources like videoconferencing technologies, home monitoring devices and other IT infrastructure. Subscriptions, reimbursements and pay-per-use revenue streams were identified as feasible for commercializing telemedicine services.",

abstract="Biomedical sensors have been widely used in various areas of biomedical practices, which play an important role in disease detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, health management, and so on. However, most of them and their related platforms are generally not easily accessible or just too expensive or complicated to be kept at home. As an alternative, new technologies enabled from the mobile phones are gradually changing such situations. As can be freely available to almost everyone, mobile phone offers a unique way to improve the conventional medical care through combining with various biomedical sensors. Moreover, the established systems will be both convenient and low cost. In this paper, we present an overview on the state-of-art biomedical sensors, giving a brief introduction of the fundamental principles and showing several new examples or concepts in the area. The focus was particularly put on interpreting the technical strategies to innovate the biomedical sensor technologies based on the platform of mobile phones. Some challenging issues, including feasibility, usability, security, and effectiveness, were discussed. With the help of electrical and mechanical technologies, it is expected that a full combination between the biomedical sensors and mobile phones will bring a bright future for the coming pervasive medical care.",

abstract="The new and groundbreaking real-time remote healthcare monitoring system on sensor-based mobile health (mHealth) authentication in telemedicine has considerably bounded and dispersed communication components. mHealth, an attractive part in telemedicine architecture, plays an imperative role in patient security and privacy and adapts different sensing technologies through many built-in sensors. This study aims to improve sensor-based defence and attack mechanisms to ensure patient privacy in client side when using mHealth. Thus, a multilayer taxonomy was conducted to attain the goal of this study. Within the first layer, real-time remote monitoring studies based on sensor technology for telemedicine application were reviewed and analysed to examine these technologies and provide researchers with a clear vision of security- and privacy-based sensors in the telemedicine area. An extensive search was conducted to find articles about security and privacy issues, review related applications comprehensively and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were investigated for articles on mHealth in telemedicine-based sensor. A total of 3064 papers were collected from 2007 to 2017. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the security and privacy of sensor-based telemedicine applications. A total of 19 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category, 57.89{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}11/19), included survey on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, 42.1{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}8/19), included articles contributed to the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. The collected studies improved the essential need to add another taxonomy layer and review the sensor-based smartphone authentication studies. This map matching for both taxonomies was developed for this study to investigate sensor field comprehensively and gain access to novel risks and benefits of the mHealth security in telemedicine application. The literature on sensor-based smartphones in the second layer of our taxonomy was analysed and reviewed. A total of 599 papers were collected from 2007 to 2017. In this layer, we obtained a final set of 81 articles classified into three categories. The first category of the articles [86.41{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}70/81)], where sensor-based smartphones were examined by utilising orientation sensors for user authentication, was used. The second category [7.40{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}6/81)] included attack articles, which were not intensively included in our literature analysis. The third category [8.64{\%} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}7/81)] included `other' articles. Factors were considered to understand fully the various contextual aspects of the field in published studies. The characteristics included the motivation and challenges related to sensor-based authentication of smartphones encountered by researchers and the recommendations to strengthen this critical area of research. Finally, many studies on the sensor-based smartphone in the second layer have focused on enhancing accurate authentication because sensor-based smartphones require sensors that could authentically secure mHealth.",

Existing research proposed a specific light-weight, incremental method to support the development of such applications; however it is not easy to learn and use. This paper aims to facilitate the development of such applications and improve the productivity of developers. We propose AocML, a textual domain-specific language which provides a high-level abstraction of AOCA applications. Specifically, we first show the software model of AOCA applications and the abstract syntax of AocML. Then, we introduce the concrete syntax of AocML. We also implement the tools for AocML, including the development environment as well as the generation of Java code and ontology specification. Moreover, we use a case study and evaluation to demonstrate the advantages of AocML.",

In this paper, we describe a new approach to integrate interactive services provided by an AmI environment with the television set, which is one of the most widely used interaction client in the home environment. The approach supports the integration of different TV set configurations, guaranteeing the possibility to develop universally accessible solutions. An implementation of this approach has been carried out as a multimodal/multi-purpose natural human computer interface for elderly people, by creating adapted graphical user interfaces and navigation menus together with multimodal interaction (simplified TV remote control and voice interaction). In addition, this user interface can also be suited to other user groups. We have tested a prototype that adapts the videoconference and the information service with a group of 83 users. The results from the user tests show that the group found the prototype to be both satisfactory and efficient to use.",

abstract="Neither on the level of interactions between organizations nor on the level of servicing users, co-production has a fixed meaning. It is argued that there are different meanings that unfold once one looks at the impact of narratives such as consumerism, managerialism, or participatory governance. Altogether with the traditions of state-welfare, they simultaneously influence the modes and meanings of co-production in personal services. Taking up the example of modern healthcare systems and its hallmarks in Germany, it is shown that, therefore, uncertainty and ambiguity is the normalcy rather than the exception when it comes to define co-production. Role-expectations such as the ``expert--patient'' or the ``citizen--consumer'' have a liberating potential, but may likewise marginalize issues such as trust and the need for protection. User organizations are well challenged beyond their role of helping users to cope as good as possible with given role models of co-production.",

abstract="Ambient assistive living environments require sophisticated information fusion and reasoning techniques to accurately identify activities of a person under care. In this paper, we explain, compare and discuss the application of two powerful fusion methods, namely dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), for human activity recognition. Both methods are described, the implementation of activity recognition based on these methods is explained, and model acquisition and composition are suggested. We also provide functional comparison of both methods as well as performance comparison based on the publicly available activity dataset. Our findings show that in performance and applicability, both DST and DBN are very similar; however, significant differences exist in the ways the models are obtained. DST being top-down and knowledge-based, differs significantly in qualitative terms, when compared with DBN, which is data-driven. These qualitative differences between DST and DBN should therefore dictate the selection of the appropriate model to use, given a particular activity recognition application.",

In Phase 1, focus groups with a total of 26 current and former caregivers revealed that as caregivers and the relatives for whom they care struggle to maintain continuity of roles, relationships, and lifestyles, safety is a key concern. Despite the limited use by some caregivers of ``low-tech'' tools (e.g., door alarms, intercoms), caregivers lack a comprehensive system to enhance their relatives' safety. In Phase 2, we identified an Internet-based monitoring system to address caregivers' major concerns. In Phase 3, focus groups with eight caregivers evaluated the system that was identified in Phase 2. Results suggest that affordable technologies exist to assist family caregivers, and that these caregivers were amenable to the use of these technologies.",

pages="13585--13614",
abstract="In recent years, human activity recognition from video has been getting considerable research attentions by computer vision researchers due to its prominent applications in various fields such as surveillance environments, human computer interactions, and smart home healthcare. For instance, activity recognition can be used in a surveillance environment to alert the related authority of potential dangerous behaviors. Similarly, the activity recognition can improve the human computer interaction (HCI) in an entertainment environment such as the automatic recognition of different player's actions in a game so as to create an avatar to play on behalf for the player. Furthermore, the activity recognition can help the rehabilitation of patients in a healthcare system where patient's action recognition can help to facilitate the rehabilitation processes. Basically, a video-based activity recognition system consists of many prominent goals, one of which is to provide information based on people's behavior in order to allow the system to proactively assist them with their tasks. A novel approach is proposed here for depth video based human activity recognition, using joint-based spatiotemporal features of depth body shapes and hidden Markov models. From depth video, different body parts of human activities are first segmented using a trained random forest. Spatial features consisting of the 3-D body joint pair angles, the mean of the depth values, the variance of the depth values, and the area of each segmented body part are combined with the motion features representing the magnitude and direction of each joint in the next frame to build the spatiotemporal features in a frame. The activity features are then further enhanced using generalized discriminant analysis to classify them nonlinearly in order to convert them to more robust features. Finally, the features are utilized for training distinguished activity hidden Markov models that can be later used for recognition. The proposed approach shows superior recognition performance compared to other conventional activity recognition approaches.",

After releasing three versions of MobiSens to the Android Market with evolving UI and increased functionalities, we have collected 13,993 h of data from 310 users over five months. We evaluate and compare the user experience and the sensing efficiency in each release. We show that the average number of activities annotated by a user increases from 0.6 to 6. This result indicates the activity auto-segmentation/recognition feature and certain UI design changes significantly improve the user experience and motivate users to use MobiSens more actively. Based on the MobiSens platform, we have developed a range of mobile sensing applications including Mobile Lifelogger, SensCare for assisted living, Ground Reporting for soldiers to share their positions and actions horizontally and vertically, and CMU SenSec, a behavior-driven mobile Security system.",

abstract="Human activity recognition (HAR) systems aim to provide low-cost, low-power, unobtrusive and non-invasive solutions to monitor and collect data accurately for human-centric applications, such as health monitoring, assisted living and rehabilitation. Although wearable sensor{\_}based HAR systems have been demonstrated to be effective in the literature, they raise various concerns such as energy consumption and hardware cost. In this work, we examine the pattern of radio signal strength variations in different activity classes in absence of sensor hardware. We present a performance comparison analysis by setting up two testbeds to compare a sensor{\_}based with a radio{\_}based HAR system over a range of variable metrics such as the number of sensor nodes, and the nodes and the sink node placement with respect to the accuracy and the energy efficiency. Wearable HAR datasets are constructed based on our reported testbeds. The main contributions of this work are in two folds: (1) when eliminating the use of accelerometers in the radio{\_}based system, beside the reduced hardware cost, prolonged lifetime of the HAR system by nearly 30{\%} can be achieved while maintaining the accuracy. The impact of the selected overlapping window size (WS) is also investigated with respect to the accuracy level in both systems over a range of activity classes. (2) The impact of the node placement on the accuracy indicates a higher dependency to the number of nodes, the nodes and the sink node placements in the radio{\_}based system due to the dependency of the results to the distance.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are augmented with sensing and communication technologies to support elderly people with personalized, adaptive and anticipatory requirements. A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environment's functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment. To deal with these issues, we introduce a contExt Aware web Service dEscription Language (wEASEL) that is an abstract service model to represent services and user tasks in AAL environments. Also, we present a set of wEASEL-based service matching algorithms and evaluate them for their suitability. The proposed service matchmaking mechanism can incorporate services that are available in local AAL environment as well as in the cloud computing marketplace.",

abstract="The 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a wake-up call for health systems in Canada, with realization of occupational health risks faced by health care workers and first responders in public health emergency response. The need for investment in critical social infrastructure---including explicitly articulated plans---became a priority for managing future pandemics. Over the past 15 years, pandemic planning has evolved with the adoption of a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction. There is recognition of the social gradient of risk, which emerges from the interaction between social determinants of health, risk of exposure, and adverse impacts from a pandemic. Additionally, there is better understanding of the benefits of planning according to functional needs, rather than deficit-oriented labelling. In this paper, we reflect on how the framing of vulnerable or high-risk populations has evolved since SARS. Looking to the future, we present the imperative for the creation of institutional space for engagement of high-risk populations in pandemic planning processes, including participatory governance. Innovative consultation strategies are needed to enhance collective asset literacy and ensure planning is adaptive to the changing social fabric. Progressive pandemic planning in the next decade must be inclusive and sensitive to modern definitions of family, varied abilities, cultural practices and gender and sexual diversity, thereby reflecting a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction.",

In this article, an algorithm is proposed to reduce the complexity involved in analysis of healthcare data. The proposed algorithm predicts the health status of elderly from the data collected at health centres by utilizing PCA (principle component analysis) and SVM (support vector machine) algorithms. The performance of proposed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with well-known methods like quadratic Discriminant, linear Discriminant, logistic regression, KNN weighted and SVM medium Gaussian using F-measure. At that point, the pre-prepared information is subjected to the dimensionality decrease process by playing out the Feature Selection errand. So, chosen component analysis are investigated by the proposed work SVM-based enhanced recursive element determination, and its precision is assessed and contrasted with the other customary classifiers, for example, quadratic Discriminant, Linear Discriminant, Logistic Regression, KNN Weighted and SVM Medium Gaussian. Here, we built up a shrewd versatile information module for the remote procurement and transmission of EHR (Electronic Health Record) chronicles, together with an online watcher for showing the EHR datasets on a PC, advanced cell or tablet. So as to characterize the highlights required by clients, we demonstrated the elderly checking system in home and healing facility settings.

A total of 1713 publications were subjected to examination in order to draw statistics and depict dynamic changes to shed new light upon the growth, spread, and collaboration of CSCW devoted outlets. Overall, our study characterizes top (cited and downloaded) papers, citation patterns, prominent authors and institutions, demographics, collaboration patterns, most frequent topic clusters and keywords, and social mentions by country, discipline, and professional status. The results highlight some areas of improvement for the field and a lot of well-established topics which are changing gradually with impact on citations and downloads. Statistical models reveal that the field is predominantly influenced by fundamental and highly recognized scientists and papers. A small number of papers without citations, the growth of the number of papers by year, and an average number of more than 39 citations per paper in all venues ensure the field a healthy and evolving nature.

abstract="Studies and concepts for social companion robots in therapy and care exist, however, they often lack the integration of convincing behavioral and social key mechanisms which enable a positive and successfull interaction experience. In this article we argue that synchrony and reciprocity are two key mechanisms of human interaction which affect both in the behavioral level (movements) and in the social level (relationships). Given that both a change in movement behavior and social behavior are an objective in the contexts of aging-in-place, neurocognitive and neurophysical rehabilitation, and depression, these key mechanisms should also be included in the interaction with social companion robots in therapy and care. We give an overview on the two concepts ranging from a social neuroscience over a behavioral towards a sociological perspective and argue that both concepts affect each other and are up to now only marginally applied in human--robot interaction. To support this claim, we provide a survey on existing social companion robots for aging-in-place (pet robots and household robots), neurocognitive impairments (autism and dementia), neurophysical impairments (brain injury, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson's disease), and depression. We emphasize to what extend synchrony and reciprocity are already included into the respective applications. Finally, based on the survey and the previous argumentation on the importance of synchrony and reciprocity, we provide a discussion about potential future steps for the inclusion of these concepts to social companion robots in therapy and care.",

month="May",
day="18",
abstract="There is no need to explain the relevance of fall detection (FD) in the elderly population: the faster they receive help, the higher the probabilities of recovery. FD has been widely studied, and a number of solutions have been proposed in the literature, including commercial products with well-known trademarks. Basically, the majority of the solutions include an Event Detection method followed by a feature extraction block as the inputs to a classifier that labels the sample as Fall or as Not Fall. Nevertheless, the proposals always rely on user feedback because of the relatively high percentage of false positives. This study proposes two supervised user-centered solutions for FD which are evaluated using two publicly available data sets that include simulated falls with the sensory system placed on a wrist. Instead of focusing on learning a generalized model, in this study we focus on learning specific models for each user. To overcome the lack of data from the Fall class, an on-line learning method to group the events arising from the activities of daily life and the consequent analysis of how fall events can then be detected is included. In addition, a transfer learning stage produces a priori knowledge from previous experiences that can be introduced into the on-line learning classifier in order to enhance its performance. Complete experimentation is carried out on two publicly available data sets, analyzing the performance of the supervised classifiers, and the performance of the whole detection system composed of the fall detection plus the classifier. In the case of on-line learning, only the results for the classifier, either with or without transfer learning, are included. The results suggest that FD user-centered solutions have the capacity to adapt to the information of a specific user, mostly when using both on-line learning and transfer learning. Nevertheless, the transfer learning stage needs refinements in order to avoid the complexity that this might introduce.",

Social acceptance and user experience were assessed using a mixed-method design consisting of observations (12 h), ten interviews and 70 questionnaires with members of staff. Findings show that the interacting modalities have to meet the very needs of specific end-user groups and that the perceived utility of a robot is very much tied to its tasks and proper functioning. Social acceptance was ambivalent. On one hand the robot was integrated into daily routines, but on the other hand staff was not willing to share their work space with a robotic aid and saw the introduction of robots in eldercare as an inevitable development. Findings on user experience showed that staff and older adults were interested in and excited about the robot. Still it is necessary to equip the robot with meaningful communication abilities as well as cues that enhance the predictability of its behavior.",

abstract="This paper reports a process to derive intermediate-level knowledge as a service design and analysis framework for designing digital services to offer alternate reality experiences, and analyzes the possible opportunities and pitfalls of the framework. The user experience felt by refining the meaning of real space through virtuality is defined as alternate reality experiences. Alternate reality experiences are typically achieved by modifying our eyesight or replacing our five senses to others, and they make our world interactive by implicitly influencing human attitudes and behaviors. First, the paper extracts observations for deriving the intermediate-level knowledge through the discussions raised in exploration workshops. In the workshops, the three digital services that utilize diverse strategies to offer alternate reality experiences are chosen. The workshops' main focus is to examine how a person could have a sense of values in alternate reality experiences via the three digital services. Second, the paper shows how to derive the proposed service design and analysis framework from the extracted observations through expert analysis, then an overview of the framework is explained. Finally, the paper presents feasibility analysis of the proposed framework through a new digital service named Mindful Reminder as a case study for refining the service through focus group discussions. The approach described in the paper is to report a concrete process through which extracted observations can be converted into intermediate-level knowledge that can be used to design alternate reality experiences. Traditionally, the process for generating intermediate-level knowledge has not been well-documented; however, documenting the process is very important in theorizing the design of alternate reality experiences and helps effectively develop a variety of emerging advanced digital services that will offer alternate reality experiences in the future.",

abstract="``Design Thinking'' -- a cross-disciplinary and user centered method -- is an approach towards the discovery of solutions and sparks innovative thinking in many ways. It also can be argued, that designers put themselves in the place of the user rather than co-creating with the consumer. Innovation is one of the current keywords across many industries, and many attempt to find new solutions to daily problems. Design Thinking as method allows to understand user needs and understand their principle problems in daily life. The design process uses intensive collaboration in cross-disciplinary settings and is divided into the exploration of the problem space and the solution space to achieve new ways of solving existing problems. Design Thinking has to integrate into the innovation process and into organizational structures right from the beginning. It constitutes a complement to classical analytical processes for problems that require lateral, not linear thinking. This article reviews the practical application of this energetic methodology in the academic context and presents some hands-on examples. The course series has been established by the Entertainment and Media Management Lab. (EMMi Lab.) at the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) and was held in cooperation with students from the University of Tampere (UTA), and the Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK). One course has been held in cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences Magdeburg-Stendal, Germany. This article describes how to train students especially with strong technical background and analytical mind-sets in the development of innovations in the field of media, foster creative thinking, and achieve problem solutions beyond the current state of the art. We present the basic curriculum, course structure, goals {\&} objectives, applied methods, settings, and theoretical aspects of Design Thinking. Our experience and reflections on conducting the courses concludes this article. The article shall be an introductory guide for anyone who intends to organize a similar course in the university context.",

abstract="We present a method for measuring gait velocity of older adults using data from existing ambient sensor networks. Gait velocity is an important predictor of fall risk and functional health. In contrast to other approaches that use specific sensors or sensor configurations, our method imposes no constraints on the elderly. We studied different probabilistic models for the modeling of the duration and the distance of the indoor walking paths. Experiments are carried out on 27 months of sensor data and include repeated assessments from an occupational therapist. We showed that gait velocities can be measured with low variance and correlate with most assessments. The advantage of our monitoring system is that because of the continuous measurements, clearer trends can be extracted than from incidental assessments of the occupational therapist.",

abstract="Motivation: Systems interoperability is a key challenge in providing continuity of care to all patients. The challenge is addressed with information standards and new approaches to systems integration based on service-oriented architectures. Model-driven development promise utilities that are suitable for software service development in the healthcare domain, but development tools are still immature and their industry uptake is low. The knowledge about how model-driven development tools can become more useful to the healthcare software developers should be strengthened. Approach: This paper presents the ModelHealth toolchain that was created in four design/assess cycles, involving 28 students and 41 professional developers in the period 2007--2010. The toolchain provides design assistance for creating software services based on concepts from the CEN-13940 standard for continuity of care, which facilitates development of interoperable software services. Results: The CEN-13940 standard was successfully incorporated into the ModelHealth Toolchain assisting developers in creating software service design models that adhered to the standard. The developers expressed that improved understanding of the target system, documentation generation, and artifact traceability were essential utilities of the model-driven approach. Conclusion: The paper concludes healthcare domain knowledge can be successfully incorporated in a model-driven development toolchain, providing valuable input to the healthcare software service design process. A set of recommendations on how to incorporate domain specific concepts into model-driven development tools is provided. To our knowledge, no other scientific publications have reported from healthcare specific model-driven tool design and evaluations. Our recommendations extend and nuance existing knowledge on model-driven development tooling in general.",

abstract="The need for environmental and urban planning reached a critical point in the year 2007, when one-half of the world's population could be defined as living in cities. Urbanisation in India is also increasing at a fast rate. Urban chaos in India, emanating from the continuous ignorance of fragile ecosystems, calls for the reshaping of existing cities as `eco-cities'. The `eco-city'---a well-known concept in the western world---is new to the Indian context. While western connotations of eco-cities should not be discarded outright in the context of India, core concerns vary significantly for obvious reasons. Recognising two facts---firstly, eco-city development is altogether a fresh approach to human settlement development in India, and, secondly, the manifold increase in the vulnerability of cities---this paper discusses documented good practice, reinforcing evolution towards the eco-city vision. Lessons drawn from the examples cited are further deconstructed in the light of their contribution to urban risk reduction, which provides direction to appreciating the `disaster-resilient eco-community' concept in Puri, a coastal city in India. Further, this paper attempts to unravel existing community-based practices in Puri, which are boon to the local environment and invariably reduce disaster risk. These seemingly modest neighbourhood initiatives symbolise immense societal wealth, which can be calibrated appropriately for reducing urban environmental risk as well. This paper also illustrates how a `disaster resilient eco-community' approach is inevitable in the present and future contexts not only to preserve sustainable development gains but also to secure human well-being.",

title="Contextual outlier detection for wireless sensor networks",
journal="Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing",
year="2019",
month="Jan",
day="10",
abstract="The quality of dataset measured and collected by wireless sensor networks (WSN) is often affected by noise and error that are inherent to resource-constrained sensor nodes. The affected data points deviating from the normal pattern are termed as outlier(s). However, detected outlier can be a result of the occurrence of an actual event. Outlier detection techniques developed for WSNs perform binary labelling of the data points and does not indicate the context stating whether the outlier is the result of an actual event or the noise/error. This paper proposes a contextual outlier detection framework specifically designed for WSNs named as in-network contextual outlier detection on edge (INCODE). The proposed framework also estimates the degree of outlierness associated with the detected outlier(s) to provide better insight into the measured data point. Algorithms used in INCODE are designed around the edge computing concept to minimize the communication and computational complexities to make it suitable for resource-constrained WSN. The results suggest an impressive 98{\%} accuracy in identifying the context of the outlier(s). The low communication and computational complexity suggest INCODE's suitability for resource constrained WSNs.",

As well as easy usage, low-cost, and robust system performance, mobility is an important functionality expected from a practical BCI system in real life. In this study, in order to enhance users' mobility, we propose internet based wireless communication between BCI system and home environment. We designed and implemented a prototype of an embedded low-cost, low power, easy to use web server which is employed in internet based wireless control of a BCI based home environment. The embedded web server provides remote access to the environmental control module through BCI and web interfaces. While the proposed system offers to BCI users enhanced mobility, it also provides remote control of the home environment by caregivers as well as the individuals in initial stages of neuromuscular disease. The input of BCI system is P300 potentials. We used Region Based Paradigm (RBP) as stimulus interface. Performance of the BCI system is evaluated on data recorded from 8 non-disabled subjects. The experimental results indicate that the proposed web server enables internet based wireless control of electrical home appliances successfully through BCIs.",

The main objective of this paper is to present a review of existing research works in the literature, referring to QoS and QoE in telemedicine and eHealth applications. The academic databases that were used to perform the searches are Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science, taking into account the date of publication from 2008 to the present. These databases cover the most information of scientific texts in multidisciplinary fields, engineering and medicine. Several search criteria were established such as `QoS' AND `eHealth' OR `Telemedicine', `QoE' AND `eHealth' AND `Telemedicine' etc. selecting the items of greatest interest. A total of 248 papers related to QoS and QoE in telemedicine and eHealth have been found, of which 39 papers have been identified as relevant works. The results show that the percentage of studies related to QoS in literature is higher with 74.36{\%} to QoE with 25.64{\%}. From the review of the research articles analyzed, it can be said that QoS and QoE in telemedicine and eHealth are important and necessary factors to guarantee the privacy, reliability, quality and security of data in health care systems.",

abstract="In a human-centric smart space, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) analysis can provide very useful information for elder care and long-term care services. ADL is defined as an assessment of a person's functional status. Many recent researches concentrate on designing a good Context Aware Computing System to automate the actions necessarily triggered by ADL recognitions. Implementing a correct ADL recognition engine is a hard work, but will repay the system with lower inference errors and higher system dependability. A good ADL recognition engine is required to adjust its inference strategy based on the learning capability in order to avoid a high error rate, especially in real world inputs with a significant difference as compared to those in the training phase. In this paper, we proposed a powerful inference engine based on the Hidden Markov Model, called the Adaptive Learning Hidden Markov Model (ALHMM), which combines the Viterbi and Baum--Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. The assessments of ALHMM are conducted on the Python platform and show the practical feasibility of Activity Recognition in residential homes. Such a technique can provide the key answer required for advancing the state-of-the-art in context-aware computing and applications in real life.",

In other words, a local community is a typical example of a complex adaptive system, and it can be simulated by a suitable model such as multi-agent systems approach; this implies that it is possible to develop a local community as a complex adaptive system using appropriate design and analysis. In this paper, we investigated the methods to analyze a local community. We visualized the day-wise relationships among the experimental participants using the passing-each-other data collected from them. As a result, we confirmed that each participant formed clusters that varied day-wise. We could also confirm several features which helped establish that a local community is a complex adaptive system.

Results from this survey demonstrate that Wearable Device users are highly concerned regarding privacy issues and consider informed consent as ``very important'' when sharing information with third parties. However, users do not appear to relate privacy issues with informed consent. Additionally, users expressed the need for having shorter privacy policies that are easier to read, a more understandable informed consent form that involves regulatory authorities and there should be legal consequences the violation or misuse of health information provided to Wearable Devices.

We involved them in a process of interaction design (IxD) for the kitchen following the tradition of participatory design (PD), to find out the potential of such a collaboration. We asked ourselves how could we, together with the intended users design for better, seamless interaction in the kitchen? Our research showed that designing for kitchen demands a high and consistent level of engagement of all the stakeholders if we are to design a truly smart and human-centred kitchen. How then, could we integrate them into the interaction design process? As an answer we developed a methodology for the integration of all the stakeholders into the whole design process. We focused on the early design phases and the ways to trigger engagement. The methodology we developed is named EPUI and consists of four parts: exploration, participation, understanding and integration. This article illustrates the EPUI methodology for successfully integrating kitchen users into the kitchen interaction design and fruitful participatory design. It is based on and combines benefits from methodologies such as PD, ADR, PADR, while in the article we explain how it also contributes to their flaws.

The storage and forwarding of WSN network packets is a typical queuing system. Based on queuing theory, this paper studies the performance analysis models of the WSN node, constructs a WSN node queuing model based on M/M/1, a WSN node queuing model with priority, a WSN node M/M/1 queuing model based on random early detection (RED) and a WSN node M/M/1 queuing model with priority based on RED. The models are analyzed theoretically and the expressions of the average delay and queue length are mathematically derived. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. Differentiating the packets into different priorities can improve the quality of service of the network. Introducing the RED congestion control and packet discarding policy can effectively solve the congestion problem.",

abstract="The fundamental problem of the existing Activity Recognition (AR) systems is that these are not general-purpose. An AR system trained in an environment would only be applicable to that environment. Such a system would not be able to recognize the new activities of interest. In this paper we propose a General-Purpose Activity Recognition System (GPARS) using simple and ubiquitous sensors. It would be applicable to almost any environment and would have the ability to handle growing amounts of activities and sensors in a graceful manner (Scalable). Given a set of activities to monitor, object names (with embedded sensors) and their corresponding locations, the GPARS first mines activity knowledge from the web, and then uses them as the basis of AR. The novelty of our system, compared to the existing general-purpose systems, lies in: (1) it uses more robust activity models, (2) it significantly reduces the mining time. We have tested our system with three real world datasets. It is observed that the accuracy of activity recognition using our system is more than 80{\%}. Our proposed mechanism yields significant improvement (more than 30{\%}) in comparison with its counterpart.",

abstract="This paper presents a method for indexing activities of daily living in videos acquired from wearable cameras. It addresses the problematic of analyzing the complex multimedia data acquired from wearable devices, which has been recently a growing concern due to the increasing amount of this kind of multimedia data. In the context of dementia diagnosis by doctors, patient activities are recorded in the environment of their home using a lightweight wearable device, to be later visualized by the medical practitioners. The recording mode poses great challenges since the video data consists in a single sequence shot where strong motion and sharp lighting changes often appear. Because of the length of the recordings, tools for an efficient navigation in terms of activities of interest are crucial. Our work introduces a video structuring approach that combines automatic motion based segmentation of the video and activity recognition by a hierarchical two-level Hidden Markov Model. We define a multi-modal description space over visual and audio features, including mid-level features such as motion, location, speech and noise detections. We show their complementarities globally as well as for specific activities. Experiments on real data obtained from the recording of several patients at home show the difficulty of the task and the promising results of the proposed approach.",

A phase-type modelling approach is used to promote better modelling and management of the specific elements of a patient pathway, using performance measures such as clinical outcomes, patient quality of life, and cost. The approach is illustrated using stroke disease. Approximately 5{\%} of the United Kingdom National Health Service budget is spent treating stroke disease each year. There is an urgent need to assess whether existing services are cost-effective or new interventions could increase efficiency. This assessment can be made using models across primary and secondary care; in particular we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis (clot busting therapy), using discrete event simulation. Using our model, patient quality of life and the costs of thrombolysis are compared under different regimes. In addition, our simulation framework is used to illustrate the impact of internal discharge queues, which can develop while patients are awaiting placement. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis of the value parameters is also carried out.",

abstract="Healthcare systems have made a dramatic shift towards ubiquitous monitoring in the recent past. The reasons for such a change have been ease of timely diagnosis, convenience and comfort of clinical treatments. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are mainly characterized by deployment of biomedical sensors around human body which transmit vital signs measurements about the health status of the patient. Unfortunately, the huge traffic load of clinical data and limited resources of biomedical sensors make the efficiency of long-term operations almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to make significant advances in sensor's energy saving. Our idea is to reduce the activities of some sensors depending on the relevance between the data they measure and the diseases to detect. This paper shows how to extend the lifetime of medical WBANs by appropriately taking benefit of correlation between the knowledge about the disease and sensing data to drive the best scheduling of the medical sensors. For that, the theoretical framework of an economic approach, i.e., network utility maximization, is developed for sensor scheduling under operations cost constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and information gain is then proposed. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy saving vs latency in disease detection.",

abstract="Data segmentation plays a critical role in performing human activity recognition in the ambient assistant living systems. It is particularly important for complex activity recognition when the events occur in short bursts with attributes of multiple sub-tasks. Although substantial efforts have been made in segmenting the real-time sensor data stream such as static/dynamic window sizing approaches, little has been explored to exploit object semantic for discerning sensor data into multiple threads of activity of daily living. This paper proposes a semantic-based approach for segmenting sensor data series using ontologies to perform terminology box and assertion box reasoning, along with logical rules to infer whether the incoming sensor event is related to a given sequences of the activity. The proposed approach is illustrated using a use-case scenario which conducts semantic segmentation of a real-time sensor data stream to recognise an elderly persons complex activities.",

Existing vision-based methods mainly concentrate on violence detection and make little effort to determine the location of violence. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust framework for detecting and localizing violence in surveillance scenes. For this purpose, a Gaussian Model of Optical Flow (GMOF) is proposed to extract candidate violence regions, which are adaptively modeled as a deviation from the normal behavior of crowd observed in the scene. Violence detection is then performed on each video volume constructed by densely sampling the candidate violence regions. To distinguish violent events from nonviolent events, we also propose a novel descriptor, named as Orientation Histogram of Optical Flow (OHOF), which are fed into a linear SVM for classification. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both detection accuracy and processing speed, even in crowded scenes.",

abstract="As a result of the increased demand for improved life styles and the increment of senior citizens over the age of 65, new home care services are demanded. Simultaneously, the medical sector is increasingly becoming the new target of cybercriminals due the potential value of users' medical information. The use of biometrics seems an effective tool as a deterrent for many of such attacks. In this paper, we propose the use of electrocardiograms (ECGs) for the identification of individuals. For instance, for a telecare service, a user could be authenticated using the information extracted from her ECG signal. The majority of ECG-based biometrics systems extract information (fiducial features) from the characteristics points of an ECG wave. In this article, we propose the use of non-fiducial features via the Hadamard Transform (HT). We show how the use of highly compressed signals (only 24 coefficients of HT) is enough to unequivocally identify individuals with a high performance (classification accuracy of 0.97 and with identification system errors in the order of 10−2).",

This framework also involves extraction of time and frequency domain features from the compressed data. These features are used for human activity recognition using a sparse based classifier. Thus, a simultaneous dimension reduction and classification approach is presented in this paper.

Context-sensitive adaptive user interfaces are advancing, although migrating access features from one device to another is very rarely addressed. In this paper, we describe the knowledge-based component of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure that infers how a device shall be best configured at the operating system layer, the application layer and the web layer to meet the requirements of a user including possible special needs or disabilities. In this regard, a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicting accessibility policies as well as recommending preference substitutes is a main requirement, as elaborated in this paper. As the proposed system emulates decision-making of accessibility experts, we validated the automatic deduced configurations against manual configurations of ten accessibility experts. The assessment result shows that the average matching score of the developed system is high. Thus, the proposed system can be considered capable of making precise decisions towards personalizing user interfaces based on user needs and preferences.",

abstract="Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30 minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were −1.4 {\textpm} 6.6 and 0.4 {\textpm} 6.7 mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (>120/70 mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.",

Beyond functionality, the integration of such robots also depends on the quality of the interaction between the robot and senior, including the provision of social support. Our research investigates the effectiveness of robot social features on human--robot interaction (HRI) with seniors when providing assistance. Specifically, we investigate how the dynamic social features of a robot, such as facial expressions and gestures, affect the interaction experience of cognitively impaired seniors during an assistive activity. In this paper, we present a comparative HRI study of seniors living with mild cognitive impairments preparing a cup of tea with the assistance from three different embodiments with varying social features. In particular, the platforms considered were a human-like robot, a character-like robot, and a tablet display. Our results show that a human-like robot having an expressive face and arm gestures significantly increased levels of engagement, positive affect, and perceived social intelligence during the interaction when compared to the other two platforms. Furthermore, even though all platforms had the same activity assistance functionality, participants preferred the human-like robot, treated it like a companion, perceived it to be more useful, and were more inclined to keep it in social or private areas in their homes. No statistically significant differences were found between interactions with the character-like robot and the tablet.",

In this paper, we present an operational semantics based on hybrid automata for Hy-tccp which is a theoretical basis for the analysis and verification of hybrid systems like intelligent environment.",

abstract="In the last decade, the rapid growth of cities and exacerbated social problems have led to a great deal of inquiry on the extent to which the physical forms of cities can contribute towards achieving a just and sustainable future. Past investigations in the western context have remained less than satisfactory, further raising concerns about their applicability to the developing world cities which face essentially different urbanisation challenges and socio-cultural shifts. As India prepares itself to become an urban majority by 2050 and gives shape to its futuristic smart cities, there is clearly a pressing need to develop stronger empirical evidence about the influence of urban forms on social sustainability which links to sustainable design, policies and practices. This research therefore, tests the effects of urban forms on six aspects of social sustainability using both, qualitative and quantitative strategies, which are calibrated and validated for Guwahati, the dominant city of Assam in India. The quantitative findings for two urban form types using six case studies show that neighbourhood forms with connected and integrated street network, higher proportion of accessible open recreational spaces, higher mix of uses, higher densities and smaller compact urban blocks display higher levels of social sustainability amongst its residents, after controlling for intervening variables. Qualitative findings for four urban form types using twelve case studies further illuminate this complex relationship at the scale of block-segments. It highlights five key theories: (i) intervening variables, (ii) spatial proximity, (iii) favourable spatiality, (iv) complementing synergies and (v) tipping point.",

It is observed in images taken from real-time records like a video, there is always a variance in human behavior, such as the position, size, etc. of the person being tracked or recorded. This study discusses how to extract and track multiple objects based on context as opposed to a single object. Via cascade extraction, the proposed system allows tracking of more than one human at a time. For this process, an extraction method based on internal and external contexts, which defines features to distinguish a human, is proposed. The proposed method defines shapes of shoulder and head area to recognize the head-shape of a human, and creates an extractor according to its edge information and geometrical shapes context. In this paper, humans in images are extracted and recognized using contexts and profiles. The proposed method is compared with a single face detector system and it shows better performance in terms of precision and speed. This trace information can be applied in safety care system. Extractions can be improved by validating the image using a context based detector when there are duplicated images.",

abstract="Conviviality has been identified as a key concept necessary to web communities, such as digital cities, and while it has been simultaneously defined in literature as individual freedom realized in personal interdependence, rational and cooperative behavior and normative instrument, no model for conviviality has yet been proposed for computer science. In this article, we raised the question whether social intelligence design could be used to designing convivial digital cities. We first looked at digital cities and identified, from a social intelligence design point of view, two main categories of digital cities: public websites and commercial websites; we also noted the experimental qualities of digital cities. Second, we analyzed the concept of conviviality for social science, multi-agent systems and intelligent interface; we showed the distinction among various kinds of use of conviviality, the positive outcomes such as social cohesion, trust and participation but also the negative aspects that emerged when conviviality became an instrument of power relations. Fourth, we looked at the normative aspect of conviviality as described in the literature and found that social norms for conviviality paralleled legal and institutional norms for digital cities. Finally, as a first step toward obtaining measures for conviviality, we presented a case study describing agents and user's interactions using dependence graphs. We also presented an analysis of conviviality requirements and described our plan and methodology for designing convivial digital cities.",

While on the other hand, these rapidly evolving cloud mining technologies and their deployment in healthcare systems also pose potential threats to patient's data privacy. In order to solve the privacy problem in the cloud mining technique, this paper proposes a semi-supervised privacy-preserving clustering algorithm. By employing a small amount of supervised information, the method first learns a Large Margin Nearest Cluster metric using convex optimization. Then according to the trained metric, the method imposes multiplicative perturbation on the original data, which can change the distribution shape of the original data and thus protect the privacy information as well as ensuring high data usability. The experimental results on the brain fiber dataset provided by the 2009 PBC demonstrated that the proposed method could not only protect data privacy towards secure attacks, but improve the clustering purity.",

abstract="New carboxymethylcellulose esters were developed with useful properties for oral dosage forms in drug delivery. Normally, commercial cellulose esters are used as the major excipients in oral dosage forms as a coating or a membrane. In applications involving compression tablets, cellulose esters are usually mixed with other more hydrophilic matrix components to facilitate dissolution of the active. In the present study, novel cellulose esters were single component matrix resins. Pharmaceutical actives were cryogenically ground as a physical blend or an amorphous blend with the polymer. Subsequently, tablets were made by direct compression using a single tablet press, or capsules were made by filling them with the ground material. Dissolution tests were completed on the solid dosage forms at pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.8 or 7.4 in a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) II device to determine the release profiles for up to 24 h. Carboxymethylcellulose esters provide an excellent matrix for controlling both the rate of release and the pH at which pharmaceutical actives release into the aqueous environment. When used in suitable quantities, dictated by the active of interest, carboxymethylcellulose acetate butyrate provided zero-order release over sustained time up to 24 h.",

abstract="Multiple location-based device-free activity recognition systems indicate that some activities related to specific locations can be inferred from the location system and adding location information can improve the accuracy of activity recognition. Therefore, localization technology is the basis for activity recognition and other applications. Radio-Map is an effective measure in Device-free localization (DFL). Traditional fingerprint systems that can provide such accuracy are suffering from human cost in Radio-Map construction and update. Although the human cost in update phase has been paid attention, the higher costs caused by the initially created are ignored. In addition, existing systems assume that RSS change measurements caused by different targets are fixed distribution in any region. The two drawbacks will greatly affect the practicability and robustness of Radio-Map. In this paper, we propose, DTransfer, an extremely low-cost DFL approach that localize different kinds of targets in different regions. We design an optimized low-rank matrix completion model based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to construct the sensing matrix (i.e., radio-map) of the original region, which greatly reduces the overhead. Next, we employ a rigorously designed quadratic transfer scheme to accurately locate different categories of targets in different regions. Finally, we apply the location information to the activity recognition algorithm; experiments have shown that the accuracy of the algorithm for adding location information is increased by approximately 6{\%}. Extensive experimental results illustrate that DTransfer achieves delightful performance.",

We explored six dimensions of mobile service consumption values: convenience, effectiveness, enjoyment, reassurance, information, and epistemic values. The proposed value dimensions expand the scope of existing value studies by proposing additional or modified value dimensions. These dimensions reflect unique characteristics of mobile service values. In addition, the effects of mobile service consumption values on mobile service uses were examined. The results show that users' value perceptions significantly influence their intention to use mobile services and that relative importance of value dimensions is different depending on types of mobile services. The exploration and verification of mobile service consumption values contributes theoretically to developing an expanded framework of consumption values in the mobile service field and to further understanding needs and motivations of mobile service users.",

abstract="Sensory environments for healthcare are commonplace nowadays. A patient monitoring system in such an environment deals with sensor data capture, transmission and processing in order to provide on-the-spot support for monitoring the vulnerable and critical patients. A fault in such a system can be hazardous on the health of the patient. Therefore, such a system must be dependable and ensure reliability, fault-tolerance, safety and other critical aspects, in order to deploy it in real scenario. Also, the management of the infrastructure resources must be efficient and the eventual system reconfiguration must be reliably performed. This paper encounters some of these issues and proposes a component platform with specific support for several QoS aspects, namely fault tolerance, safe inter-component communication and resource management. The platform adopts the Service Component Architecture (SCA) model and defines a Data Distribution Service (DDS) binding, which provides the fault tolerance and the required safety-ensuring techniques and measures, as defined in the IEC 61784-3-3 standard. As a proof of concept, a distributed home care application that improves the medical assistance in case of fire detection is presented.",

Yet, they suffer from a serious mismatch between their functions and finances. As a result, they have been consistently neglecting core urban public facilities, critically needed for sustaining growth. This is puzzling as externalities in cities create windfall benefits to both immobile and mobile factors. Surprisingly, there is no discussion on benefit taxation, emphasised by Wicksell (in: Musgrave, Peacock (eds) Classics in the theory of public finance, Macmillan, London, 1896) and Lindahl (The justness of taxation, University of Lund, Lund, 1919), as a strategy of financing urban infrastructure. This paper suggests combining the golden rules of local public finance, principles of benefit taxation, value capture financing and earmarking, borrowing, tax increment financing and tax-sharing in the spirit of cooperative federalism to address the needs of planned urban development in India.

In this paper, the proposed framework of human lying-pose detection is optimization and machine learning algorithms inspired by processes of neurobiology suggest and human vision system to select possible object locations. First, the proposed model effectively utilizes binarized normed gradient features to obtain the objectness rapidly based on the vision saliency. Further, deep-learning techniques based on the convolution neural network are trained for learning rich feature hierarchies, in order to obtain the object of lying-pose human from objectness estimation, unlike the classical sliding-window algorithm.

The objectives of this White Paper are threefold: (1) to present the current state of affairs of EDeAN, active since 2002 as part of the European Commission's action line supporting the development of the European Information Society; (2) to outline a roadmap for future initiatives, actively reflecting views of the EDeAN network in specific domains related to DfA, e-Accessibility and e-Inclusion; and (3) to bring forward a set of suggestions and recommendations regarding the activities of the network, aiming to support the creation of a fully inclusive European Information Society. The paper is organised as follows: Section 1 provides a short introduction to DfA and Accessibility in Information Society (IS) and Information Society Technology (IST) developments in Europe. Section 2 provides an overview of policy as well as R{\&}D activities related to DfA and accessibility in IST in Europe. Section 3 briefly describes the role of EDeAN and the new challenges that emerge as a result of the changing European policy environment. Section 4 presents current challenges that emerge in five domains directly related to DfA and accessibility, such as policy and legislation, industry, monitoring and evaluation---benchmarking, standardisation, R{\&}D, and education and training. Finally, Sect. 5 puts forward a number of recommendations with regard to future activities for EDeAN. The contents of this paper reflect results from the open discussion forums supported in the EDeAN website (ref: EDeAN Special Interest Groups, SIGs). The draft paper was written by the EDeAN Secretariat for 2005, FORTH-ICS (Greece), and completed with the support of all NCCs. Support was also provided by the European Commission DG Information Society and Media and by the D4ALLnet project (ref: an EC funded project with the code IST-2001-38833).",

abstract="The dependence on broadband to enhance the economy and environment sustainability is imposing immense urgency to provide ubiquitous wireless broadband access which is a key enabler to a greater spread of society. One of the key barriers to the network connectivity and survivability identified is the lack of or unreliable infrastructure. In our previous studies we have identified that the most unreliable component in a hybrid optical wireless broadband access network infrastructure is the power grid in remote areas and least developed countries. In this paper we extend our studies to evaluate the effect of the costs of backup power on sustaining survivability at the front end of two types of network configurations in a hybrid optical wireless broadband access network. The configurations investigated are full survivability and alternative path survivability networks. Our results show that the provision of backup power to all the nodes in a network configuration with one alternative path is able to reduce the cost of deployment compared to that of a full survivability network configuration without significantly affecting the network survivability.",

Two types of talent are examined: human capital in terms of the educational attainment and the creative class in terms of the occupational skill. Explanatory variables of the talent distribution cover both market factors (jobs and wage levels) and non-market factors (amenities, openness and the university). The results of correlation analysis and multivariate analysis show that the university is the single most important factor that affects the talent distribution in China. Wage levels, service amenities and openness also contribute to talent attraction but to different extents. Furthermore, human capital outweighing the creative class exhibits positive effects on innovation, entrepreneurship and regional economic performance. Openness presents a direct influence not only on talent stock, but on innovation and regional economic performance as well. Explanations of empirical results in the Chinese context are offered.",

abstract="In the next decades, the growth in population aging will cause important problems to most industrialized countries. To tackle this issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) systems can reinforce the well-being of elderly people, by providing emergency, autonomy enhancement, and comfort services. These services will postpone the need of a medicalized environment and will allow the elderly to stay longer at home. However, each elderly has specific needs and a deployment environment of such services is likely unique. Furthermore, the needs evolve over time, and so does the deployment environment of the system. In this paper, we propose the use of a model-based development method, the adaptive medium approach, to enable dynamic adaptation of AAL systems. We also propose improvements to make it more suited to the AAL domain, such as considering heterogeneity and a composition model. The paper includes an evaluation of the prototype implementing the approach, and a comparison with related work.",

abstract="Heuristic evaluation is the preferred method to assess usability in games when experts conduct this evaluation. Many heuristics guidelines have been proposed attending to specificities of games but they only focus on specific subsets of games or platforms. In fact, to date the most used guideline to evaluate games usability is still Nielsen's proposal, which is focused on generic software. As a result, most evaluations do not cover important aspects in games such as mobility, multiplayer interactions, enjoyability and playability, etc. To promote the usage of new heuristics adapted to different game and platform aspects we propose a modular approach based on the classification of existing game heuristics using metadata and a tool, MUSE (Meta-heUristics uSability Evaluation tool) for games, which allows a rebuild of heuristic guidelines based on metadata selection in order to obtain a customized list for every real evaluation case. The usage of these new rebuilt heuristic guidelines allows an explicit attendance to a wide range of usability aspects in games and a better detection of usability issues. We preliminarily evaluate MUSE with an analysis of two different games, using both the Nielsen's heuristics and the customized heuristic lists generated by our tool.",

abstract="A novel breed of robots known as socially assistive robots is emerging. These robots are capable of providing assistance to individuals through social and cognitive interaction. However, there are a number of research issues that need to be addressed in order to design such robots. In this paper, we address one main challenge in the development of intelligent socially assistive robots: The robot's ability to identify human non-verbal communication during assistive interactions. In particular, we present a unique non-contact and non-restricting automated sensor-based approach for identification and categorization of human upper body language in determining how accessible a person is to the robot during natural real-time human-robot interaction (HRI). This classification will allow a robot to effectively determine its own reactive task-driven behavior during assistive interactions. Human body language is an important aspect of communicative nonverbal behavior. Body pose and position can play a vital role in conveying human intent, moods, attitudes and affect. Preliminary experiments show the potential of integrating the proposed body language recognition and classification technique into socially assistive robotic systems partaking in HRI scenarios.",

abstract="Although virtual enterprises (VE) make it possible for small flexible enterprises to form a collaborative network to respond to business opportunities through dynamic coalition and sharing of the core competencies and resources, they also pose new challenges and issues. Creation of VE involves dynamically established partnerships between the partners and relies on a flexible coordination scheme. The dynamic organizations formed in VE present a challenge in the development of a new methodology to dynamically allocate re-sources and deliver the relevant information to the right people at the right time. A key issue is the development of an effective workflow management scheme for VE. Multi-agent systems (MAS) provide a flexible architecture to deal with changes based on dynamic organization and collaboration of autonomous agents. Despite the extensive studies and research results on MAS, development of a design methodology to support coordination and operations is critical to the success and adoption of VE. The objectives of this research are to propose a design methodology to facilitate coordination and development of context-aware workflow management systems and achieve effective resource allocation for VE based on MAS architecture. To achieve these objectives, a scheme for coordination of agents is proposed. Petri net models are used in the coordination scheme to describe workflows and capture resource activities in VE. The interactions between agents lead to a dynamic workflow model for VE. Based on the aforementioned model, we propose architecture to dynamically generate context-aware graphical user interface to guide the users and control resource allocation based on the state of VE. An order management example is used throughout this paper to illustrate the proposed design methodology.",

In addition, the model should be flexible to be applied in different areas, such as entertainment and education, and can be easily understood and operated by robot designers. To meet these requirements, we propose an affective model including emotions, moods and personality traits for social robots to mimic the affect changes of human beings. Inspired by the Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, we first construct an affective space which can simultaneously represent the affective concepts. According to the affective space, the model can be visualized vividly and easily understood. We then describe the interaction among these concepts to change the robot states to make the robot interact with human beings naturally and believably. By tuning the parameters of the model, it can be flexibly applied in different areas. We evaluate the proposed model in simulation and human-robot interaction experiments and the experimental results show that the model is effective.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can recognize transition activities (e.g., turn to left or right, stand up, and travel down the stairs). Unlike simple activities, the transition activities have unique characteristics that change continuously and occur instantaneously. To recognize the transition activities with these characteristics, we applied convolutional neural network (CNN) that is widely adopted to recognize images, voices, and human activities. In addition, to generate input instances for the CNN model, we developed the overlapped sliding window method, which can accurately recognize the transition activities occurring during a short time. To increase the accuracy of the activity recognition, we have learned CNN models by separating the simple activity and the transition activity. Finally, we adopt fuzzy logic that can be used to handle ambiguous activities. All the procedures of recognizing the elderly's activities are performed using the data collected by the six sensors embedded in the smartphone. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown through experiments. We demonstrate that our approach can improve recognition accuracy of transition activities.",

And an adaptive fractional differential dynamic mask is constructed in term of the optimal order and Riemann--Liouville (R--L) fractional definition. And then it is applied to SIFT algorithm for image matching. The method proposed in this paper is an important extension of SIFT algorithm.

abstract="Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces are a key component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote utilization of- and socialization in- shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design, development, and technology studies conducted for understanding the social interactions of older adults in retirement communities. To understand current use of shared spaces, observational studies were conducted in a retirement community. Moreover, interventions were implemented to evaluate the impact of designed technologies in shared spaces. The results motivate the need for an automated behavioral mapping surveillance system to quantify social interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. This paper describes the development of a video-based analysis system for understanding social interactions among older adults in retirement communities. Specific emphasis is given to describing the automated behavioral mapping surveillance system designed to monitor the number, length, and type of interactions of older adults in retirement communities. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using video cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment, and discuss the development of a surveillance system specifically for quantifying social interaction. This study is relevant for the field of social robotics as an example of a realistic application domain.",

The research aimed to see whether people perceived that e-participation has time, cost, quality, and transparency advantages over traditional participation channels which some researchers have suggested is the case. The study also wanted to investigate whether perceiving one or more of these advantages has an impact on whether a person uses e-participation. Using data from the 2012 EU eGovernment Benchmark-User survey we found that people who perceive these advantages are more likely to use e-participation but the various advantages have different impacts. Saving time has the strongest impact on use. Perceiving quality and transparency advantages also impacts use, but a perceived cost advantage does not. In addition, we found that people are more likely to use e-participation if they are satisfied with a jurisdiction's website and application design. These findings have implications for how governments should design and market websites if they want to increase e-participation.",

abstract="This paper investigates the fusion of wearable and ambient sensors for recognizing activities of daily living in a smart home setting using ontology. The proposed approach exploits the advantages of both types of sensing to resolve uncertainties due to missing sensor data. The resulting system is able to infer activities which cannot be inferred with the single type of sensing only. The methodology of ontological modeling the wearable and ambient sensors and the fusion of contexts captured from the sensors, as well as corresponding activity is investigated and described. The proposed system is compared with a system that uses ambient sensors without wearable sensor on the internally collected and publicly available datasets. The results of the experiments show that the proposed system is more robust in handling uncertainties. It is also more capable of inferring additional information about activities, which is not possible with environment sensing only, with overall recognition accuracy of 91.5 and 90{\%} on internal and public datasets, respectively.",

abstract="The ambient intelligence consists of the integration of computer science technologies in the objects of the environment around us in order to create a smart one. Each object in the environment performs a different service as part of achieving a task. The adaptive Service composition is a context-aware system used in the situation where the user's needs cannot be satisfied by a single service but by the combination of several ones. One of the main and principal characteristics of ambient environments is the adaptability to the context. The multi-agent systems with their characteristics of autonomy, proactivity, mobility and sociability are one of the most promising techniques of service composition and they became a major and significant paradigm for developping ambient systems. In this paper, we present a model of adaptive service composition in ambient environment based on multi-agent system named Multi Agent System for Adaptive Service Composition (MAS-ASC). To each object of the environment is associated an agent. The set of the agents coordinate their competences taking into account the context in order to perform an activity. MAS-ASC is based on the Contract Net Protocol in which the agents exchange their proposals in the form of call for proposal. It is implemented on Java Agent DEvelopment framework platform and has been tested to economize the consumption of energy in an intelligent lighting system example.",

abstract="Many countries are experiencing a rapid increase in their elderly populations, increasing the demand for appropriate healthcare systems including fall-detection systems. In recent years, many fall-detection systems have been developed, although most require the use of wearable devices. Such systems function only when the subject is wearing the device. A vision-based system presents a more convenient option. However, visual features typically depend on camera view; a single, fixed camera may not properly identify falls occurring in various directions. Thus, this study presents a solution that involves using multiple cameras. The study offers two main contributions. First, in contrast to most vision-based systems that analyze silhouettes to detect falls, the present system proposes a novel feature for measuring the degree of impact shock that is easily detectable with a wearable device but more difficult with a computer vision system. In addition, the degree of impact shock is less sensitive to camera views and can be extracted more robustly than a silhouette. Second, the proposed method uses a majority-voting strategy based on multiple views to avoid performing the tedious camera calibration required by most multiple-camera approaches. Specifically, the proposed method is based on spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs). The number of local STIP clusters is designed to indicate the degree of impact shock and body vibration. Sequences of these features are concatenated into feature vectors that are then fed into a support vector machine to classify the fall event. A majority-voting strategy based on multiple views is then used for the final determination. The proposed method has been applied to a publicly available dataset to offer evidence that the proposed method outperforms existing methods based on the same data input.",

The use of interactive whiteboards in the Special Education Center Princesa Sofia presented a few challenges for both the teachers and the students, hence KiNEEt was developed to overcome these problems. KiNEEt is a system which has been developed with the major aim of improving physical and cognitive skills in students with special needs. The different activities in KiNEEt are configurable and the tutor can modify the settings according to the needs of the student. The activities are game-oriented to attract the students attention and motivate them to learn. KiNEEt is highly interactive and it will encourage the students to be active learners. Results showed that Microsoft Kinect is the most suitable platform for this device as the students will be able to use the computer while simultaneously improving their digital competence, cognitive and physical skills.",

abstract="In recent years, human activity recognition from body sensor data or wearable sensor data has become a considerable research attention from academia and health industry. This research can be useful for various e-health applications such as monitoring elderly and physical impaired people at Smart home to improve their rehabilitation processes. However, it is not easy to accurately and automatically recognize physical human activity through wearable sensors due to the complexity and variety of body activities. In this paper, we address the human activity recognition problem as a classification problem using wearable body sensor data. In particular, we propose to utilize a Deep Belief Network (DBN) model for successful human activity recognition. First, we extract the important initial features from the raw body sensor data. Then, a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are performed to further process the features and make them more robust to be useful for fast activity recognition. Finally, the DBN is trained by these features. Various experiments were performed on a real-world wearable sensor dataset to verify the effectiveness of the deep learning algorithm. The results show that the proposed DBN outperformed other algorithms and achieves satisfactory activity recognition performance.",

abstract="Rehabilitative therapy is usually very expensive and confined to specialized rehabilitation centers or hospitals, leading to slower recovery times for corresponding patients. Therefore, there is a high demand for the development of technology-based personalized solutions to guide and encourage patients towards performing online rehabilitation program that can help them live independently at home. This paper introduces an innovative e-health framework that develops adaptive serious games for people with hand disabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a patient-adaptive environment for the gamification of hand therapies in order to facilitate and encourage rehabilitation issues. Theoretical foundations (i.e., therapy and patient models) and algorithms to match therapy-based hand gestures to navigational movements in 3D space within the serious game environment have been developed. A novel game generation module is introduced, which translates those movements into a 3D therapy-driven route on a real-world map and with different levels of difficulty based on the patient profile and capabilities. In order to enrich the user navigation experience, a 3D spatio-temporal validation region is also generated, which tracks and adjusts the patient movements throughout the session. The gaming environment also creates and adds semantics to different types of attractive and repellent objects in space depending on the difficulty level of the game. Relevant benchmarks to assess the patient interaction with the environment along with a usability and performance testing of our framework are introduced to ensure quantitative as well as qualitative improvements. Trial tests in one disability center were conducted with a total number of five subjects, having hand motor controls problems, who used our gamified physiotherapy solution to help us in measuring the usability and users' satisfaction levels. The obtained results and feedback from therapists and patients are very encouraging.",

In the present paper, we described our project designed to address the growing unmet need for alternative approaches to slowing the progression of cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients. NAO is the experimental platform used in an ecological setting: a center for the treatment of cognitive disorders and dementia of the Italian health service. This paper describes the study addressed to evaluate the effectiveness of human--robot interaction to reinforce therapeutic behavior and treatments adherence and presents the latest findings of functional tests and users investigation recently conducted. The robot was programmed to implement some tasks from the usual memory-training program protocol. In different training conditions, subjects participated in sessions with the support of NAO or only from the psychologist while the interaction was recorded for subsequent exploration. Data indicated that memory training with NAO resulted in an increase of visual gaze from patients and reinforce of therapeutic behavior reducing, in some cases, depressive symptoms. Unexpectedly, significant changes in prose memory and verbal fluency measures were detected. These findings suggest that further research on robotics in ecological settings is necessary to determine the extent to which they can effectively support clinical practice.",

Recently various fall detection approaches have been proposed., among which computer vision based approaches offer a promising and effective way. In this paper, we proposed a new framework for fall detection based on automatic feature learning methods. First, the extracted frames, including human from video sequences of different views, form the training set. Then, a PCANet model is trained by using all samples to predict the label of every frame. Because a fall behavior is contained in many continuous frames, the reliable fall detection should not only analyze one frame but also a video sequence. Based on the prediction result of the trained PCANet model for each frame, an action model is further obtained by SVM with the predicted labels of frames in video sequences. Experiments show that the proposed method achieved reliable results compared with other commonly used methods based on the multiple cameras fall dataset, and a better result is further achieved in our dataset which contains more training samples.",

Existing work has also focused on the importance of various other factors (e.g., demographic variables, interest in science and technology, prior robot experience) that predict robot acceptance. Specific robot types like service or healthcare robots have also been investigated. Nevertheless, more research is needed to substantiate the empirical evidence on the role of culture, robot type, and other predictors when researching attitudes toward robots. We did so by conducting a survey on attitudes toward education robots in the German context. Besides, in the present research, we investigated predictors of attitudes toward education robots. Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest that German respondents have neutral attitudes toward education robots. However, our data support the notion of relative reluctance to engage in learning processes that include robots. Regarding demographic variables and personality dispositions, our results show that gender, age, need for cognition , and technology commitment significantly predicted people's attitudes. Concerning potential areas of application, respondents could picture using education robots in domains related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and rejected education robots in fields of arts and social sciences.",

To this end, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed smartwatch studies related to health care by searching PubMed, EBSCOHost, Springer, Elsevier, Pro-Quest, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases to find articles between 1998 and 2016. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a smartwatch was used, (2) the study was related to a healthcare application, (3) the study was a randomized controlled trial or pilot study, and (4) the study included human participant testing. Each article was evaluated in terms of its application, population type, setting, study size, study type, and features relevant to the smartwatch technology. After screening 1119 articles, 27 articles were chosen that were directly related to health care. Classified applications included activity monitoring, chronic disease self-management, nursing or home-based care, and healthcare education. All studies were considered feasibility or usability studies, and had limited sample sizes. No randomized clinical trials were found. Also, most studies utilized Android-based smartwatches over Tizen, custom-built, or iOS-based smartwatches, and many relied on the use of the accelerometer and inertial sensors to elucidate physical activities. The results show that most research on smartwatches has been conducted only as feasibility studies for chronic disease self-management. Specifically, these applications targeted various disease conditions whose symptoms can easily be measured by inertial sensors, such as seizures or gait disturbances. In conclusion, although smartwatches show promise in health care, significant research on much larger populations is necessary to determine their acceptability and effectiveness in these applications.",

abstract="The demand and growth of indoor positioning has increased rapidly in the past few years for a diverse range of applications. Various innovative techniques and technologies have been introduced but precise and reliable indoor positioning still remains a challenging task due to dependence on a large number of factors and limitations of the technologies. Positioning technologies based on radio frequency (RF) have many advantages over the technologies utilizing ultrasonic, optical and infrared devices. Both narrowband and wideband RF systems have been implemented for short range indoor positioning/real-time locating systems. Ultra wideband (UWB) technology has emerged as a viable candidate for precise indoor positioning due its unique characteristics. This article presents a comparison of UWB and narrowband RF technologies in terms of modulation, throughput, transmission time, energy efficiency, multipath resolving capability and interference. Secondly, methods for measurement of the positioning parameters are discussed based on a generalized measurement model and, in addition, widely used position estimation algorithms are surveyed. Finally, the article provides practical UWB positioning systems and state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that the review presented in this article provides a structured overview and comparison of the positioning methods, algorithms and implementations in the field of precise UWB indoor positioning, and will be helpful for practitioners as well as for researchers to keep abreast of the recent developments in the field.",

Our goal is to propose a novel method to detect falls on the floor with a multiple-camera system using the percentage of human-occupied areas. We suggest the use of two relatively orthogonal views to estimate the percentage of the surface of the person which is in contact with the ground according to the foreground information of each camera. These features are computed to differentiate by an automatic manner the lying on floor posture which can be considered as fall to other position such as standing up or sitting. This method is evaluated on a public multi-view fall detection dataset which contains videos of a healthy subject who performed 24 realistic scenarios. These scenarios show 22 fall events and 24 confounding events. The results of our experiments show that our proposed algorithm achieved 95.8 {\%} sensitivity and 100 {\%} specificity with less computational costs than state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract="Brain--Computer Interfaces (BCI) rely on the interpretation of brain activity to provide people with disabilities with an alternative/augmentative interaction path. In light of this, BCI could be considered as enabling technology in many fields, including Active and Assisted Living (AAL) systems control. Interaction barriers could be removed indeed, enabling user with severe motor impairments to gain control over a wide range of AAL features. In this paper, a cost-effective BCI solution, targeted (but not limited) to AAL system control is presented. A custom hardware module is briefly reviewed, while signal processing techniques are covered in more depth. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are exploited in this work as operating BCI protocol. In contrast with most common SSVEP-BCI approaches, we propose the definition of a prediction confidence indicator, which is shown to improve overall classification accuracy. The confidence indicator is derived without any subject-specific approach and is stable across users: it can thus be defined once and then shared between different persons. This allows some kind of Plug{\&}Play interaction. Furthermore, by modelling rest/idle periods with the confidence indicator, it is possible to detect active control periods and separate them from ``background activity'': this is capital for real-time, self-paced operation. Finally, the indicator also allows to dynamically choose the most appropriate observation window length, improving system's responsiveness and user's comfort. Good results are achieved under such operating conditions, achieving, for instance, a false positive rate of 0.16 min−1, which outperform current literature findings.",

abstract="Fatigue in lower extremity musculature is associated with decline in postural stability, motor performance and alters normal walking patterns in human subjects. Automated recognition of lower extremity muscle fatigue condition may be advantageous in early detection of fall and injury risks. Supervised machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) have been previously used for classifying healthy and pathological gait patterns and also for separating old and young gait patterns. In this study we explore the classification potential of SVM in recognition of gait patterns utilizing an inertial measurement unit associated with lower extremity muscular fatigue. Both kinematic and kinetic gait patterns of 17 participants (29 {\textpm} 11 years) were recorded and analyzed in normal and fatigued state of walking. Lower extremities were fatigued by performance of a squatting exercise until the participants reached 60{\%} of their baseline maximal voluntary exertion level. Feature selection methods were used to classify fatigue and no-fatigue conditions based on temporal and frequency information of the signals. Additionally, influences of three different kernel schemes (i.e., linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) were investigated for SVM classification. The results indicated that lower extremity muscle fatigue condition influenced gait and loading responses. In terms of the SVM classification results, an accuracy of 96{\%} was reached in distinguishing the two gait patterns (fatigue and no-fatigue) within the same subject using the kinematic, time and frequency domain features. It is also found that linear kernel and RBF kernel were equally good to identify intra-individual fatigue characteristics. These results suggest that intra-subject fatigue classification using gait patterns from an inertial sensor holds considerable potential in identifying ``at-risk'' gait due to muscle fatigue.",

abstract="Activity recognition is an emerging field of research that enables a large number of human-centric applications in the u-healthcare domain. Currently, there are major challenges facing this field, including creating devices that are unobtrusive and handling uncertainties associated with dynamic activities. In this paper, we propose a novel Evolutionary Fuzzy Model (EFM) to measure the uncertainties associated with dynamic activities and relax the domain knowledge constraints which are imposed by domain experts during the development of fuzzy systems. Based on the time and frequency domain features, we define the fuzzy sets and estimate the natural grouping of data through expectation maximization of the likelihoods. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is investigated and designed to determine the optimal fuzzy rules. To evaluate the EFM, we performed experiments on seven daily life activities of ten human subjects. Our experiments show significant improvement of 9 {\%} in class-accuracy and 11 {\%} in the F-measures of recognized activities compared to existing counterparts. The practical solution to dynamic activity recognition problems is expected to be an EFM, due to EFM's utilization of smartphones and natural way of handling uncertainties.",

abstract="The recent studies in Morphometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have investigated the abnormalities in the brain volume that have been associated diagnosing of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by making use of the Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM). The system permits the evaluation of the volumes of grey matter in subjects such as the AD or the conditions related to it and are compared in an automated manner with the healthy controls in the entire brain. The article also reviews the findings of the VBM that are related to various stages of the AD and also its prodrome known as the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For this work, the Ada Boost classifier has been proposed to be a good selector of feature that brings down the classification error's upper bound. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) had been employed for the dimensionality reduction and for improving efficiency. The PCA is a powerful, as well as a reliable, tool in data analysis. Calculating fitness scores will be an independent process. For this reason, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with a greedy search may be computed easily along with some high-performance systems of computing. The primary goal of this work was to identify better collections or permutations of the classifiers that are weak to build stronger ones. The results of the experiment prove that the GAs is one more alternative technique used for boosting the permutation of weak classifiers identified in Ada Boost which can produce some better solutions compared to the classical Ada Boost.",

abstract="Latest studies done on huge data collected from aging features proved that the performance of facial image based age estimation is low and need to be improved. One of the significant biometric traits for human recognition or search is Human age. Age assessment is very much exigent over other pattern recognition problems since the aging differs from person to person. This paper proposes a new framework that uses periocular region for age feature extraction and application of hybrid algorithm for age recognition. Firstly, preprocessing and periocular region normalization is done to acquire age invariant features. Secondly, the periocular region that underwent preprocessing is analyzed using hybrid approach, a novel machine algorithm that combines both SVM and kNN. The proposed technique generates the best recognition outputs.",
