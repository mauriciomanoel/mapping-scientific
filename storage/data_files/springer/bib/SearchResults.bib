abstract="The effectiveness of services providing assistive technology (AT) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions is crucial to the success of any intervention. Centres specialized in AT and AAL are generally part of a complex network of public services and are integrated within the rehabilitation, education and assistance processes aimed at people with disabilities and the elderly which require the involvement of different professionals. The service of providing AT and AAL solutions is therefore a complex process which needs a multidisciplinary approach requiring specific models for the analysis of quality. To date, there is a lack of research in the AAL field targeting quality assessment of AAL interventions. The present paper describes a model for AAL quality assessment and provides preliminary data on its usefulness in practice.",

Existing solutions are no longer enough to embrace challenges brought by complex scenarios and multi-stakeholder realities, as in Ambient Assisted Living ecosystems. As new concepts and cross-domain solutions emerge, these problems are tackled by connecting evermore the world of requirements and architectures, of business and technology, through service-oriented approaches. This due, we propose to extend the Four-Step-Rule-Set (4SRS) method, which has proven successful in generating a proper candidate logical architecture for an information system in ill-defined contexts, to a Service-Oriented Architecture approach for greater business integration, flexibility, and agility, by using the SoaML language. We present the result of a demonstration project, based in an industrial live setting where the 4SRS-SoaML reshaped method was applied, by generating the architectural participants, and respective channels of services and requests.",

abstract="Everyday more and more ubiquitous applications are developed to support aging in place and ambient assisted living. Although these technologies typically adhere to the functional requirements defined by their developers, many of these solutions evidence limitations for being adopted by end-users, i.e., older adults. This paper reports the authors' experience in the design and deployment of several iterations of the SocialConnector system---a computer-supported family communication mediator---as a case study that helps identify key factors that ease the adoption of ambient intelligent systems encouraging intergenerational family communication at home. The particularity of the followed approach is to assemble widely available mass-market technology---such as commercial Tablet PCs and TV displays---glued together with innovative software, as a way to drive system adoption through economically affordable hardware running over empirically-driven considerations for designing effective software in this study domain. The case study results help researchers and practitioners to conceive technology that has a better chance of being embraced by older adults and their supporting family networks; particularly, when such a technology is going to be deployed in their homes. Therefore, the key design factors identified in this paper can be used to inform the conception and modeling of ambient intelligent systems that help older adults address several aspects of their aging in place process, like health monitoring, personal security, social engagement, support to daily activities, and ultimately, fostering wellbeing.",

As Milner noticed, the question now is whether we shall understand this ubiquitous computer we are building. This is especially true as designers are more and more using complex techniques for every component of the system and building systems which are made of increasingly heterogenous parts. With this extended editorial, we embark on an exploration journey into the exciting new area of ``reliable intelligent environments'' (RIEs). Taking the perspective of an RIE engineer, we present a selection of approaches that have been put forward to design, verify, and operate IEs in a manner so that users can rely on Intelligent Environment systems. We outline crucial challenges: the situatedness which exposes IE to challenges similar to those known from robotics and control systems, the embedding of human users and the safety, privacy, and usability requirements thus entailed, and the amounts of data produced by sensors and actuators, which require advanced reasoning and learning mechanisms to handle them in a reliable way in real-time. We also sketch the opportunities reliable IEs provide to developing new markets and products.",

abstract="The expectations of the abilities of context-aware systems (C-AS) often differ from reality. It becomes difficult to program contextual services that react adequately to the circumstantial needs of users as developers need to know, beforehand: the set of contextual states that may exist, what information could accurately determine a contextual state within that set, and what appropriate action should be taken in that particular state. Although there exist many frameworks and tools which support the design and implementation of C-AS, there is less conceptual help for developers to inform them of what contextual situations and services are appropriate (or feasible) to be implemented. This report reviews the state-of-the-art conceptualisation of context, which is more focused on the representational interpretation of the concept, to introduce a perspective that also acknowledges its interactional interpretation. A combination of revised and new definitions is introduced, which give key insights for the development of more useful C-AS. By acknowledging situations as a dynamic phenomenon that arises from action (interaction), and needs to be understood by the developers, it facilitates the analysis of these subjective interpretations into programming constructs (representation). The conceptualisation is also complemented with a set of guidelines for developers, an illustration of their usage, and a further discussion on the future directions for the engineering of more usable C-AS. The introduced conceptualisation is targeted towards the creation of an open-source tool supported framework for the engineering of C-AS.",

abstract="In elderly care the shortage of available financial and human resources for coping with an increasing number of elderly people becomes critical. Current solutions to this problem focus on efficiency gains through the usage of information systems and include homecare services provided by IT systems. However, the current IT systems that integrate homecare services have difficulties in handling the user-context dynamicity and the diversity of needs and preferences of care-receivers. This makes the available homecare services hardly interoperable at the process level, particularly due to the lack of support for process flexibility. In this paper, we present an approach capable of dealing with such interoperability issues based on aspect-oriented service composition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and of the proposed architecture by implementing a prototype for a reminder service scenario.",

Crucially, MoCoA supports a small set of programming abstractions that are suitable for building a wide range of context-aware applications for deployment in a fixed or (ad hoc) mobile environment. For each of these abstractions, MoCoA provides a set of implementations via a library of components. We present three applications of the MoCoA framework that demonstrate both the use of the programming abstractions and the flexibility of the framework.",

abstract="In order to become more innovative, companies that operate in the Smart Living domain increasingly initiate and participate in networked business environments that transcend industry boundaries. Inter-organizational collaboration is often characterized by conflicting strategic interests and incoherent operational business processes and procedures. Although many scholars and practitioners use stakeholder analysis to gain insight into the actors' relationships and interactions, existing literature on stakeholder analysis focuses mainly on high-level strategic analysis, often limited to a conceptual and static understanding of stakeholder interests. In this paper, it is argued that a `true' understanding of stakeholders can be achieved by looking at their interactions and interdependencies at a more detailed level. This study uses a conceptual framework from the service innovation and business model domain, the VIP framework, to extend stakeholder analysis by including an analysis of their dynamic interactions and processes. The qualitative evaluation of the framework's application in illustrative design cases shows that this extension provides additional insights into stakeholders, and their potential operational conflicts and critical dependencies. By making these conflicts and interdependencies explicit, products and services are potentially easier to implement and commercialize.",

In this study, the risk priority number of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) was employed to determine improvement priorities for service demands. This methodology facilitates constructing a comprehensive Aging in Place policy and increases effective use of resources. The Aging in Place categories and policies are crucial. QFD and FMEA techniques were used in this study to design an Aging in Place policy and meet elderly people demands, provide a clear design, and improve service quality to match the demands and expectations of elderly people. The 16 service demands were identified by the experts and scholars. Six management techniques were obtained: education and training, space planning, medical facilities, human resources, transportation facilities, and recreational activities.

abstract="Pervasive computing applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of inhabitants of the environment, such as their locations, activities, vital signs, and environmental measures. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in ``aging-in-place'' scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.",

abstract="Proper coding and transmission of medical and physiological data is a crucial issue for the effective deployment and performance of telemedicine services. This chapter presents a platform for performing proper medical content adaptation based on context awareness. Sensors are used in order to determine the status of a patient being monitored through a medical network. Additional contextual information regarding the patient's environment (e.g., location, data transmission device and underlying network conditions, etc.) is represented through an ontological knowledge base model. Rule-based evaluation determines proper content (i.e., biosignals, medical video and audio) coding and transmission of medical data, in order to optimize the telemedicine process. The paper discusses the design of the ontological model and provides an initial assessment.",

title="Universal design, inclusive design, accessible design, design for all: different concepts---one goal? On the concept of accessibility---historical, methodological and philosophical aspects",

abstract="Accessibility and equal opportunities for all in the digital age have become increasingly important over the last decade. In one form or another, the concept of accessibility is being considered to a greater or smaller extent in most projects that develop interactive systems. However, the concept varies among different professions, cultures and interest groups. Design for all, universal access and inclusive design are all different names of approaches that largely focus on increasing the accessibility of the interactive system for the widest possible range of use. But, in what way do all these concepts differ and what is the underlying philosophy in all of these concepts? This paper aims at investigating the various concepts used for accessibility, its methodological and historical development and some philosophical aspects of the concept. It can be concluded that there is little or no consensus regarding the definition and use of the concept, and consequently, there is a risk of bringing less accessibility to the target audience. Particularly in international standardization the lack of consensus is striking. Based on this discussion, the authors argue for a much more thorough definition of the concept and discuss what effects it may have on measurability, conformance with standards and the overall usability for the widest possible range of target users.",
