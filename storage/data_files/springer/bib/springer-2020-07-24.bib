abstract="A self-adaptive system (SAS) can reconfigure at run time in response to adverse combinations of system and environmental conditions in order to continuously satisfy its requirements. Moreover, SASs are subject to cross-cutting non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as performance, security, and usability, that collectively characterize how functional requirements (FRs) are to be satisfied. In many cases, the trigger for adapting an SAS may be due to a violation of one or more NFRs. For a given NFR, different combinations of hierarchically-organized FRs may yield varying degrees of satisfaction (i.e., satisficement). This paper presents Providentia, a search-based technique to optimize NFR satisficement when subjected to various sources of uncertainty (e.g., environment, interactions between system elements, etc.). Providentia searches for optimal combinations of FRs that, when considered with different subgoal decompositions and/or differential weights, provide optimal satisficement of NFR objectives. Experimental results suggest that using an SAS goal model enhanced with search-based optimization significantly improves system performance when compared with manually- and randomly-generated weights and subgoals.",

abstract="Requirements Engineering plays a crucial role in the software development process. Many works have pointed out that Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are critical to the quality of software systems. NFRs, also known as quality requirements, can be difficult to elicit due to their subjective diversity nature. In this paper, we introduce the QR Framework which uses an ontology-based approach to support the collection of knowledge on possible solutions to implement NFRs, semi-automatically connecting related NFRs. Preliminary search mechanisms are provided in a tool to facilitate the identification of possible solutions to an NFR and their related consequences to other solutions and/or other NFRs. To evaluate whether our approach aids eliciting NFRs, we conducted a controlled experiment performing a software development scenario. Our results suggest that reusing NFR knowledge can drive software engineers to obtain a closer to complete set of possible solutions to address quality concerns.",

abstract="The existence of variations in the organizational environment makes the configuration of business process models a complex activity, even for experienced business analysts. The increasing adoption of business processes models by software engineers as a input for requirements analysis strengthens the importance of adressing this issue. The challenge is to configure business processes to fit the organization better. We propose an approach that combines variability analysis and non-functional requirements to drive the configuration of a business process. Applying this approach we can analyze variability in the model in order to assess the impact of the choices on the process quality constraints - the non-functional requirements. Moreover, it provides a rationale for the selection of a specific configuration.",

These composite services are distributed across the network, adapted dynamically during run-time, and still required to work correctly and be available on demand. The development of these kinds of modern services requires new modeling and analysis methods and techniques to enable service reliability during run-time. In this paper, we define the required phases of the composite service design and execution to achieve reliable composite service. These phases are described in the form of a framework. We perform a literature survey of existing methods and approaches for reliable composite services to find out how they match with the criteria of our framework. The contribution of the work is to reveal the current status in the research field of reliable composite service engineering.",

abstract="Pervasive environments support users' daily routines in an invisible and unobtrusive way. To do so, they include a technical pervasive infrastructure, which is aware of and adaptive to both the operational context and the users at hand. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) have been effectively used to inform decision-making in software engineering: functional alternatives are compared in terms of their contribution to NFRs satisfaction. In this work, we consider user preferences over NFRs as a key driver for the adaptation of a pervasive infrastructure. We devise a model-driven framework for building pervasive systems that maximize fitness with the context and the user. Our contributions are: (i) adaptive task models, a conceptual model to describe user routines that accounts for user preferences over NFRs; and (ii) an adaptation framework, which uses our models at runtime to guide a pervasive infrastructure in adapting its behaviour to user preferences and context.",

abstract="Changing requirements are widely regarded as one of the most significant risks for software systems development. However, in today's business landscape, these changing requirements also represent opportunities to exploit new and evolving business conditions. In consonance with other agile methods, we advocate requirements engineering techniques that embrace and accommodate requirements change. This agile approach to requirements must nonetheless be systematic and incorporate some degree of planning, especially with respect to accommodating quality attributes such as safety and security. This chapter examines the nature of requirements evolution, and the two main problems that it entails. The first is to correctly understand what is changing in the requirements, that is, the elicitation problem. The other is to act on that new information using models and other representations of the requirements, influencing the architecture and implementation of the software system. This chapter first motivates the importance of considering changing requirements in evolving software systems. It then surveys historical and existing approaches to requirements evolution with respect to the elicitation and taking action problems. Finally, the chapter describes a framework for supporting requirements evolution, defining the Requirements Evolution Problem as finding new specifications to satisfy changed requirements and domain assumptions. To motivate this, we discuss a real-life case study of the payment card industry.",

abstract="The behaviour of self adaptive systems can be emergent, which means that the system's behaviour may be seen as unexpected by its customers and its developers. Therefore, a self-adaptive system needs to garner confidence in its customers and it also needs to resolve any surprise on the part of the developer during testing and maintenance. We believe that these two functions can only be achieved if a self-adaptive system is also capable of self-explanation. We argue a self-adaptive system's behaviour needs to be explained in terms of satisfaction of its requirements. Since self-adaptive system requirements may themselves be emergent, we propose the use of goal-based requirements models at runtime to offer self-explanation of how a system is meeting its requirements. We demonstrate the analysis of run-time requirements models to yield a self-explanation codified in a domain specific language, and discuss possible future work.",

A Dynamically Adaptive System (DAS) adjusts its behaviour autonomously at runtime in order to accommodate changes in its operating environment, which are anticipated in the system's requirements specification. [Question/Problem] In this paper, we argue that Dynamic Adaptive Systems' requirements specifications are more susceptible to change than those of traditional static systems. We propose an extension to i* strategic rationale models to aid in changing a DAS. [Principal Ideas/Results] By selecting some of the types of tracing proposed for the most complex systems and supporting them for DAS modelling, it becomes possible to handle change to a DAS' requirements efficiently, whilst still allowing artefacts to be stored in a Requirements Management tool to mitigate additional complexity.

abstract="Quality requirements (QRs) are a key artifact needed to ensure the quality and success of a software system. Despite their importance, QRs rarely get the same degree of attention as their functional counterpart in agile software development (ASD) projects. Moreover, crucial information that can be obtained from software development repositories (e.g., JIRA, GitHub) is not fully exploited, or is even neglected, in QR elicitation activities. In this work, we present a data-driven tooled approach for the semi-automatic generation and documentation of QRs in the context of ASD. The approach is based on the declaration of thresholds over quality-related issues, whose violation triggers user-defined alerts. These alerts are used to browse a catalog of QR patterns that are presented to the ASD team by means of a dashboard that implements several analysis techniques. Once selected, the patterns generate the QRs, which are documented and stored in the product backlog. The full approach is implemented via a configurable platform. Over the course of 1 year, four companies differing in size and profile followed this approach and deployed the platform in their premises to semi-automatically generate QRs in several projects. We used standardized measurement instruments to elicit the perception of 22 practitioners regarding their use of the tool. The quantitative and qualitative analyses yielded positive results; i.e., the practitioners' perception with regard to the tool's understandability, reliability, usefulness, and relevance was positive. We conclude that the results show potential for future adoption of data-driven elicitation of QRs in agile companies and encourage other practitioners to use the presented tool and adopt it in their companies.",

For example, adaptability is a key concern for autonomic and adaptive systems, which brings to them the capability to alter their behavior in response to changes on their surrounding environments. In this paper, we propose a Strategy for Transition between Requirements and Architectural Models for Adaptive systems (STREAM-A). In particular, we use goal models based on the i* (i-Star) framework to support the design and evolution of systems that require adaptability. To obtain software architectures for such systems, the STREAM-A approach uses model transformations from i* models to architectural models expressed in Acme. Both the requirements and the architectural model are refined to accomplish the adaptability requirement.",

abstract="The emergence of collective adaptive systems---i.e., computational systems made up of an ensemble of autonomous components that have to operate in a coordinated and adaptive way in open-ended and unpredictable environments---calls for innovative modeling and software engineering tools, to support their systematic and rigorous design and development. In this paper, we present a general model for collective adaptive systems called SOTA (``State Of The Affairs''). SOTA brings together the lessons of goal-oriented requirements modeling, context-aware system modeling, and dynamical systems modeling. It has the potential for acting as a general reference model to help tackling some key issues in the design and development of collective adaptive systems. In particular, as we will show with reference to a scenario of collectives of autonomous vehicles, SOTA enables: early verification of requirements, identification of knowledge requirements for self-adaptation, and the identification of the most suitable architectural patterns for self-adaptation.",

abstract="A software system is developed for satisfying requirements of stakeholders. Each requirement will be never satisfied without the collaboration of several components such as the system, devices and people interacting with them, i.e. users. However, a user does not or cannot always behave toward the other components according to their expectations. For example, a user sometimes makes mistake or even misuse of the system. The system thus has to encourage users to behave according to such expectations as well as possible. In this paper, we propose a method for eliciting software requirements that will improve users' behavior with respect to the expectations. We rely on transparency, i.e. the open flow of information amongst stakeholders because no one can directly manipulate users but transparency has an influence on users' behavior. We expect users will voluntarily behave better than ever when the system provides suitable information flows. We represent our method by using KAOS goal modeling notation, and show examples how it works.",

abstract="[Context and motivation] Dynamically adaptive systems are increasingly conceived as a means to allow operation in changeable or poorly understood environments. [Question/problem] This can result in the selection of solution strategies based on assumptions that may not be well founded. [Principle ideas/results] This paper proposes the use of claims in goal models as a means to reason about likely sources of uncertainty in dynamically adaptive systems. Accepting that such claims can't be easily validated at design-time, we should instead evaluate how the system will behave if a claim is proven false by developing a validation scenario. [Contribution] Validation scenarios may be costly to evaluate so the approach we advocate is designed to carefully select only those claims that are less certain, or whose falsification would have serious consequences.",

As new concepts and cross-domain solutions emerge, these problems are tackled by connecting evermore the world of requirements and architectures, of business and technology, through service-oriented approaches. This due, we propose to extend the Four-Step-Rule-Set (4SRS) method, which has proven successful in generating a proper candidate logical architecture for an information system in ill-defined contexts, to a Service-Oriented Architecture approach for greater business integration, flexibility, and agility, by using the SoaML language. We present the result of a demonstration project, based in an industrial live setting where the 4SRS-SoaML reshaped method was applied, by generating the architectural participants, and respective channels of services and requests.",

We propose a software development life cycle that helps developers to engineer adaptive behavior and to address the issues posed by the diversity of self-* properties. The life cycle is characterized by three feedback loops, i.e. based on verification at design time, based on monitoring and awareness in the runtime, and the feedback provided by runtime data to the design phases. We illustrate how the life cycle can be instantiated using specific languages, methods and tools developed within the ASCENS project.

abstract="Everyday more and more ubiquitous applications are developed to support aging in place and ambient assisted living. Although these technologies typically adhere to the functional requirements defined by their developers, many of these solutions evidence limitations for being adopted by end-users, i.e., older adults. This paper reports the authors' experience in the design and deployment of several iterations of the SocialConnector system---a computer-supported family communication mediator---as a case study that helps identify key factors that ease the adoption of ambient intelligent systems encouraging intergenerational family communication at home. The particularity of the followed approach is to assemble widely available mass-market technology---such as commercial Tablet PCs and TV displays---glued together with innovative software, as a way to drive system adoption through economically affordable hardware running over empirically-driven considerations for designing effective software in this study domain. The case study results help researchers and practitioners to conceive technology that has a better chance of being embraced by older adults and their supporting family networks; particularly, when such a technology is going to be deployed in their homes. Therefore, the key design factors identified in this paper can be used to inform the conception and modeling of ambient intelligent systems that help older adults address several aspects of their aging in place process, like health monitoring, personal security, social engagement, support to daily activities, and ultimately, fostering wellbeing.",

abstract="The cloud is a distributed architecture providing resources as tiered services. Through the principles of service-orientation and generally provided using virtualisation, the deployment and provisioning of applications can be managed dynamically, resulting in cloud platforms and applications as interdependent adaptive systems. Dynamically adaptive systems require a representation of requirements as dynamically manageable models, enacted through a controller implementing a feedback look based on a control-theoretic framework. We argue that a control theory and model-based architectural framework for the cloud is needed. While some critical aspects such as uncertainty have already been taken into account, what has not been accounted for are challenges resulting from the cloud architecture as a multi-tiered, distributed environment. We identify challenges and define a framework that aims at a better understanding and a roadmap towards control-theoretic, model-based cloud architecture -- driven by software architecture concerns.",

The energy consumption model is then deployed to estimate the impact of software applications based on their resource usage. Our work has been validated on desktop and mobile devices. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed energy profiling tool that provided relevant information on the energy consumption of software applications.",

Self-adaptive systems are typically instrumented with tools to autonomously perform adaptation to these changes while maintaining some desired properties. In this paper we model and analyze self-adaptive systems by means of typed, attributed graph grammars. The interplay of different grammars representing the application and the adaptation logic is realized by an adaption manager. Within this formal framework we define consistency and operational properties that are maintained despite adaptations and we give static conditions for their verification. The overall approach is supported by the AGG tool for modeling, simulating, and analyzing graph transformation systems. A case study modeling a business process that adapts to changing environment conditions is used to demonstrate and validate the formal framework.",

With this extended editorial, we embark on an exploration journey into the exciting new area of ``reliable intelligent environments'' (RIEs). Taking the perspective of an RIE engineer, we present a selection of approaches that have been put forward to design, verify, and operate IEs in a manner so that users can rely on Intelligent Environment systems. We outline crucial challenges: the situatedness which exposes IE to challenges similar to those known from robotics and control systems, the embedding of human users and the safety, privacy, and usability requirements thus entailed, and the amounts of data produced by sensors and actuators, which require advanced reasoning and learning mechanisms to handle them in a reliable way in real-time. We also sketch the opportunities reliable IEs provide to developing new markets and products.",

Around this language, several analysis techniques have emerged, e.g., goal satisfaction analysis and metrics computation. In this work, we present a consolidated version of the i* language based on the most adopted versions of the language. We define the main constructs of the language and we articulate them in the form of a metamodel. Then, we implement this version and a concrete technique, goal satisfaction analysis based on goal propagation, using ADOxx.

abstract="Future cities will be populated by myriads of autonomous self-driving vehicles. Although individual vehicles have their own goals to pursue in autonomy, they may also be part of a collective of vehicles, as in the case of a fleet of vehicles of a car sharing company. Accordingly, they may also be required to act in a coordinated way towards the achievement of specific collective goals, or to meet specific city-level objectives. This raises the issue of properly engineering the behavior of such collective of vehicles, by properly capturing their collective requirements also in consideration of their individual goals, and understanding which knowledge about the state of the collective they must be provided with. In this context, this paper shows how the SOTA model can be a very effective tool to support the engineering of self-driving vehicle collectives. SOTA, by bringing together the lessons of goal-oriented requirements engineering, context-aware systems, and dynamical systems modeling, has indeed the potential for acting as a general reference model to help tackle some key issues in the design and development of complex collective systems immersed in dynamic environments, as collectives of self-driving vehicles are.",

Still, principled and rigorous foundations that can be taught, practiced, and systematically replicated are lacking. We argue that change has to become a first-class concept and that the development tools used by engineers and the run time environment supporting software execution should be structured in a way that naturally accommodates change. We distinguish between evolution and adaptation and discuss how software can be made self-adaptive, and how it can cooperate with humans in-the-loop, supporting continuous verification and assuring dependability. We discuss how several research approaches that were investigated in the past decade may be integrated and extended in a roadmap of future work leading to progress in tool support and automation to achieve dependable adaptation and evolution.",

abstract="The Future Internet (FI) comprises scenarios where many heterogeneous and dynamic entities must interact to provide services (e.g., sensors, mobile devices and information systems in smart city scenarios). The dynamic conditions under which FI applications must execute call for self-adaptive software to cope with unforeseeable changes in the application environment. Software engineering currently provides frameworks to develop reasoning engines that automatically take reconfiguration decisions and that support the runtime adaptation of distributed, heterogeneous applications. However, these frameworks have very limited support to address security concerns of these application, hindering their usage for FI scenarios. We address this challenge by enhancing self-adaptive systems with the concepts of trust and reputation. Trust will improve decision-making processes under risk and uncertainty, in turn improving security of self-adaptive FI applications. This paper presents an approach that includes a trust and reputation framework into a platform for adaptive, distributed component-based systems, thus providing software components with new abilities to include trust in their reasoning process.",

abstract="Self-adaptation enables software systems to respond to changing environmental contexts that may not be fully understood at design time. Designing a dynamically adaptive system (DAS) to cope with this uncertainty is challenging, as it is impractical during requirements analysis and design time to anticipate every environmental condition that the DAS may encounter. Previously, the RELAX language was proposed to make requirements more tolerant to environmental uncertainty, and Claims were applied as markers of uncertainty that document how design assumptions affect goals. This paper integrates these two techniques in order to assess the validity of Claims at run time while tolerating minor and unanticipated environmental conditions that can trigger adaptations. We apply the proposed approach to the dynamic reconfiguration of a remote data mirroring network that must diffuse data while minimizing costs and exposure to data loss. Results show RELAXing Claims enables a DAS to reduce adaptation costs.",

abstract="By nature, Cyber-physical systems are very often subjected to uncertainty events that can occur in their environment. This paper presents the first results of our work on how to deal with environment uncertainty in goal-based requirements engineering. This work is motivated by the fact that current goal-based approaches do not natively allow for unanticipated adaptations. To do so, we explore the introduction of RELAX concepts into SysMLKaos. RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems that includes explicit constructs to handle the inherent uncertainty in these systems. On the other hand, SysMLKaos is a Goal Based Requirements Engineering approach that takes into account Non-Functional Requirements at the same level of abstraction as Functional Requirements and models the impact of Non-Functional Requirements on Functional Requirements. We use an extract of a Landing Gear System case study to illustrate the proposed approach.",

This description is uncoupled from any implementation and can therefore be reused with other components. Given an application description, a MaDcAr engine builds a constraint solving problem that makes it possible to choose an appropriate configuration and the components to assemble. This choice takes into account the cost of the target configuration with respect to the available resources. To ensure the application consistency, the engine relies on the state transfer rules to initialize the component attributes of the target assembly using the component attributes of the source assembly.",

abstract="Designing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) for optimal autonomy while meeting user requirements is quite challenging. Researchers have focused on improving autonomy algorithms and verification methods to ensure safe and reliable autonomous behavior in UASs, but little research has been conducted on requirements engineering for UASs to answer design questions and explore the trade space for using autonomy to satisfy user requirements. This paper introduces a method to determine an optimal set of autonomous capabilities that satisfies UAS user requirements in the early stages of conceptual design. The method uses a modified Autonomy Requirements Engineering (ARE) process that applies quantitative measures and statistical analysis to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE). We demonstrate this method in a case study of a ``disaster robot,'' i.e., a hazard response UAS for which the autonomy requirements were optimized using a goal model developed in the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), as implemented in the modeling tool jUCMNav. The high-level goals of the hazard response UAS---system performance, cost, and safety---were evaluated using the formula-based GRL strategy evaluation algorithm resident in jUCMNav version 6.0. An autonomy trade space study was conducted through a Design and Analysis of Simulation Experiments (DASE). Our designed simulation experiment inserted the number of trials (evaluation strategies) and inputs into the goal model, and evaluation data were analyzed to optimize design factors based on user weightings of the response variables. This paper presents a structured method of ARE for UASs, which could be adopted more broadly across other domains, demonstrating how to optimize autonomous capabilities for different design conditions.",

Current enterprise architecture approaches have limited ability to model and reason about the adaptiveness that is available or desirable in various parts of an enterprise. In this vision paper, we attempt a preliminary characterization of an adaptive enterprise, so as to stimulate debate and research towards EA frameworks that explicitly support adaptiveness as a design goal.

abstract="Sociotechnical systems (STSs) are defined by the interaction between technical systems, like software and machines, and social entities, like humans and organizations. The entities within an STS are autonomous, thus weakly controllable, and the environment where the STS operates is highly dynamic. As a result, the design artifacts that represent the requirements of an STS, such as requirements models, may end up being invalid when the system operates, for the autonomous entities do not comply with the requirements, or the environment changes. In this paper, we present a framework that uses runtime execution data to support the runtime validation of requirements models and to guide the evolution of an STS. We propose two types of evolution: (i) manual: the analyst uses Bayesian inference to discover which assumptions in a requirements model are invalid and manually adjusts the system or its model; and (ii) automated: requirements are iteratively revised by an hill climbing algorithm searching for requirements that maximize the achievement of the stakeholders' objectives. We evaluate the effectiveness of different revision heuristics on a smart traffic simulation applied to an exemplar from the self-adaptive systems literature. The results show that our heuristics, informed by runtime execution data, outperform standard uninformed heuristics, in terms of convergence speed, solution quality, and stability. Moreover, the algorithms show good resilience to noise introduced into the execution data.",

As smart interactions must managed automatically and interactively in response to evolving user's matters of concern, the smart Internet requires creative approaches where services and interactions are implemented with awareness of, and dynamic adaptation to, users, computational environments, changing policies and unknown requirements. Consequently, modeling and managing dynamic context is critical for implementing smart services and smart interactions effectively. Thus, smart interactions need infrastructure to acquire, compose, and distribute context information to multiple execution endpoints. Moreover, context management must be controlled and governed to optimize system properties.

pages="257--281",
abstract="Recently, more attention is paid to the researches and practices on how to use software architecture in software maintenance and evolution to reduce their complexity and cost. The key in such architecture-based maintenance and evolution is to recover software architecture from existing systems. Almost all studies on architecture recovery focus on analyzing the source code and other documents. Such recovered software architecture can hardly capture runtime states and behaviors of the system. At the same time, current work pays little attention on how to change the system directly via manipulating the recovered software architecture. This paper presents a novel approach to recovering software architecture from component based systems at runtime and changing the runtime systems via manipulating the recovered software architecture. Containing much more details than the designed software architecture, the recovered software architecture can accurately and thoroughly describe the actual states and behaviors of the runtime system. It can be described formally with the extension of traditional architecture description language, which enables the recovered software architecture to absorb the semantics embedded in the designed software architecture. The recovered software architecture can be represented as multiple views so as to help different users to control the complexity from different concerns. Based on the reflective ability of the component framework, the recovered software architecture is up-to-date at any time and changes made on it will immediately lead to the corresponding changes in the runtime system. The approach presented in this paper is demonstrated on PKUAS, a reflective J2EE (Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition) application server, and the performance is also evaluated.",

abstract="Mission-critical software (MCS) must provide continuous, online services to ensure the successful accomplishment of critical missions. Self-adaptation is particularly desirable for assuring the quality of service (QoS) and availability of MCS under uncertainty. Few techniques have insofar addressed the issue of MCS self-adaptation, and most existing approaches to software self-adaptation fail to take into account uncertainty in the self-adaptation loop. To tackle this problem, we propose a fuzzy control based approach, i.e., Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA), with a view to deal with the challenge of MCS self-adaptation under uncertainty. First, we present the SFSA conceptual framework, consisting of sensing, deciding and acting stages, and establish the formal model of SFSA to lay a rigorous and mathematical foundation of our approach. Second, we develop a novel SFSA implementation technology as well as its supporting tool, i.e., the SFSA toolkit, to automate the realization process of SFSA. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the development of an adaptive MCS application in process control systems. Validation experiments show that the fuzzy control based approach proposed in this work is effective and with low overheads.",

This process in complex systems engineering is extremely intense, because there is a large number of stakeholders involved, with expertise deriving from heterogeneous domains. Moreover, requirements' improvements and variations are common during system life cycle phases. Thus, there is a risk of inconsistency of requirements during the engineering of a system. This paper provides a contribution in requirements engineering as it explores requirements interoperability in complex systems when multiples dimensions are involved. It discusses requirement management according to the cross-domains dimension, the cross-systems life cycle dimension, the cross-requirements dimension and the risk of inconsistency when three dimensions are involved simultaneously during the life cycle phases. The main result is an overview of the existing gaps in one and/or more dimensions allowing a discussion on the possibilities to cope with the problem of requirements inconsistency in multiples dimensions.",

pages="157--173",
abstract="A method for requirements analysis is proposed that accounts for individual and personal goals, and the effect of time and context on personal requirements. First a framework to analyse the issues inherent in requirements that change over time and location is proposed. The implications of the framework on system architecture are considered as three implementation pathways: functional specifications, development of customisable features and automatic adaptation by the system. These pathways imply the need to analyse system architecture requirements. A scenario-based analysis method is described for specifying requirements goals and their potential change. The method addresses goal setting for measurement and monitoring, and conflict resolution when requirements at different layers (group, individual) and from different sources (personal, advice from an external authority) conflict. The method links requirements analysis to design by modelling alternative solution pathways. Different implementation pathways have cost--benefit implications for stakeholders, so cost--benefit analysis techniques are proposed to assess trade-offs between goals and implementation strategies. The use of the framework is illustrated with two case studies in assistive technology domains: e-mail and a personalised navigation system. The first case study illustrates personal requirements to help cognitively disabled users communicate via e-mail, while the second addresses personal and mobile requirements to help disabled users make journeys on their own, assisted by a mobile PDA guide. In both case studies the experience from requirements analysis to implementation, requirements monitoring, and requirements evolution is reported.",

abstract="The expectations of the abilities of context-aware systems (C-AS) often differ from reality. It becomes difficult to program contextual services that react adequately to the circumstantial needs of users as developers need to know, beforehand: the set of contextual states that may exist, what information could accurately determine a contextual state within that set, and what appropriate action should be taken in that particular state. Although there exist many frameworks and tools which support the design and implementation of C-AS, there is less conceptual help for developers to inform them of what contextual situations and services are appropriate (or feasible) to be implemented. This report reviews the state-of-the-art conceptualisation of context, which is more focused on the representational interpretation of the concept, to introduce a perspective that also acknowledges its interactional interpretation. A combination of revised and new definitions is introduced, which give key insights for the development of more useful C-AS. By acknowledging situations as a dynamic phenomenon that arises from action (interaction), and needs to be understood by the developers, it facilitates the analysis of these subjective interpretations into programming constructs (representation). The conceptualisation is also complemented with a set of guidelines for developers, an illustration of their usage, and a further discussion on the future directions for the engineering of more usable C-AS. The introduced conceptualisation is targeted towards the creation of an open-source tool supported framework for the engineering of C-AS.",

Since the seventies, the terms dependability and resilience have been used in nearly all the scientific and technological fields related to Information and Communication systems. The introduction and use of these concepts in all these fields makes it difficult to have a common and precise definition. Having such a definition is nevertheless mandatory for the software and systems engineering research community that create development processes, languages and tools to support the engineering of products that would be required to be dependable or resilient. For this, we introduce an abstract and generic terminology defined mathematically to be used when speaking about dependability and resiliency. We also provide some abstract semantic descriptions to these terminological elements. This formal framework is defined from a software engineering perspective, which means that we define its components such that they are useful for the development or improvement of analysis, architectural design, detailed design, implementation, verification and maintenance phases. To this aim, we provide the necessary elements in accordance with a model driven engineering perspective that enable the definition of a new modelling language for dependable and resilient systems.",

abstract="Software plays a prominent and critical role in large business applications, health care industry, technical endeavors in space missions, and control systems for airlines, railways and telecommunications. In turn, software affects every aspect of human endeavor including the control and delivery of most of the services that we depend on. The World Wide Web (WWW) has introduced new opportunities for business and social networking, while at the same time has raised concerns on security, privacy, and reliability of information content and its use. Software for managing these applications are complex to construct. The source of complexity of a software product lies in the identification of a set of adequate functional and non-functional requirements from domain analysis, specifying system integrity constraints, and gathering the vast amount of knowledge necessary to precisely describe the expected interaction of the software with its environment. When all requirements are not properly understood, recorded, and communicated within the development team, there is a gap between the documented requirements and the requirements actually needed for correct functioning of the system. The inability in mastering the complexity leads to this discrepancy, which is the root cause of software errors. Precise documentation of domain models and system requirements with sufficient detail to cover unexpected worst-case scenarios is a good defense against system errors. Formal methods can provide a foundation for describing complex systems, for reasoning about the behavior of software systems, and can be a complimentary approach to traditional software development methodologies.",

Combining current research results from different disciplines with industrial experience, this paper dares to think out of the box and look beyond the limits of traditional safety assurance. It structures upcoming challenges posed by the emergence of open systems of systems, tries to shift existing paradigms to meet those new challenges, and proposes an abstract conceptual framework building on comprehensive interlinked multi-concern runtime models for dynamically assuring the safety as well as other properties of open systems of systems. As there currently is no comprehensive realization of the framework, we discuss what kind of approaches could fit into which parts of the framework and exemplify this for the case of conditional safety certificates.",

First of all we outline a survey on existing middlewareMiddlewaresolutions for building ambient adaptive systems. After, discussing the limitations of the existing approaches, we present our propositions for a middlewareMiddlewarearchitecture to support dynamic adaptation within ambient environments. Our approach is based on the service-oriented architecture (SOAService Oriented Architecture) paradigm which can be considered as an evolution of the component-based design paradigm. The aim is to use component interfaces for the identification and automated connection of components acting as service providers/consumers.

abstract="In elderly care the shortage of available financial and human resources for coping with an increasing number of elderly people becomes critical. Current solutions to this problem focus on efficiency gains through the usage of information systems and include homecare services provided by IT systems. However, the current IT systems that integrate homecare services have difficulties in handling the user-context dynamicity and the diversity of needs and preferences of care-receivers. This makes the available homecare services hardly interoperable at the process level, particularly due to the lack of support for process flexibility. In this paper, we present an approach capable of dealing with such interoperability issues based on aspect-oriented service composition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and of the proposed architecture by implementing a prototype for a reminder service scenario.",

abstract="Process-aware information systems have a significant potential to support both systems and humans in various processes by partially or completely automating certain activities. However, greater adoption and inclusion are currently hindered by the cost of ownership and significant investments due to the burdens associated with the design, modeling, implementation, testing, optimization, manual adaptation, variant management, and exception handling for processes, besides the general administrative system management costs. While purely autonomic processes would ideally not require any human interaction, this chapter describes a vision for autonomically-capable processes, where processes are practically supported by the system in such a way that they reduce the human interaction burdens by being context-aware and exhibiting certain self-configuration, self-adaptation, self-optimization, and self-healing capabilities. Various cross-cutting aspects and issues requiring consideration in order to address these challenging capabilities are discussed, and potentially useful methods and techniques towards achieving the vision are highlighted. Furthermore, an example system targeted at one domain that exhibits these capabilities to some degree is used to illustrate how a combination of various techniques can be synergistically applied to a system to support incremental autonomic capabilities for processes.",

In this paper, we describe MoCoA, a flexible middleware framework that permits the rapid development of context-aware applications and supports deployment scenarios ranging from augmented artefacts to city-wide smart-space applications. Crucially, MoCoA supports a small set of programming abstractions that are suitable for building a wide range of context-aware applications for deployment in a fixed or (ad hoc) mobile environment. For each of these abstractions, MoCoA provides a set of implementations via a library of components. We present three applications of the MoCoA framework that demonstrate both the use of the programming abstractions and the flexibility of the framework.",

abstract="MAS development requires an appropriate methodology. Rather than seek a single, ideal methodology, we investigate the applicability of method engineering, which focuses on project-specific methodology construction from existing method fragments and provides an appealing approach to organize, appropriately access and effectively harness the software engineering knowledge of MAS methodologies. In this context, we introduce a generic metamodel to serve as a representational infrastructure to unify the work product component of MAS methodologies. The resultant metamodel does not focus on any class of MAS, nor does it impose any restrictions on the format of the system requirements; rather, it is an abstraction of how the work product elements in any MAS are structured and behave both at design time and run-time. Furthermore, in this paper we validate this representational infrastructure by analysing two well-known existing MAS metamodels. We sketch how they can be seen as subtypes of our generic metamodel, providing early evidence to support the use of our metamodel towards the construction of situated MAS methodologies.",

abstract="After reviewing current approaches to design theory, which are based on the transformative concept of function, we argue that this basis in function limits the scope of design problems and explanatory power of current design theories. As an alternative with greater potential for explanatory power and a framework for solving a wider array of design problems, we propose that a relational theory of design is needed. Such a relational theory should mirror those currently developed in mathematics, physics, computer science, and even philosophy. We develop a relational theory for design based on the concept of affordances from perceptual psychology. Affordances help to explain the entanglement between designers, users, and artifacts---relationships that are not currently handled by function based approaches to design. Affordance based design, as developed in this paper, does not offer a radical new approach to doing design, but rather a shift in design thinking. Our focus in this paper is therefore on the explanatory power and potential innovation fostered by this change in design thinking, as illustrated through several examples, and not on specific methods.",

abstract="Testing a software system is an important step approach to ensuring quality, safety, and reliability in safety-critical systems (SCS). Several authors have published new approaches to improve the processes of testing safety requirements taking into consideration existing processes that seek to improve techniques and contribute positively with software developers. This article aims to investigate the main approaches to requirements testing, particularly focusing on safety requirements in the context of SCS. We investigated how these approaches have been developed and what contributions they provide to academia and industry. We evaluated the pros and cons of the approaches and how they related to the joint work of requirements engineers and testers. We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), selecting 53 papers published between 1990 and 2018. Our research was conducted according to the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Biolchini. The results of this SLR point out to the new research related to the software and safety-critical systems testing. The results show issues in the integration of requirements engineers with the application test team and gaps in the approaches found, particularly in the applications of the techniques in the industry setting. Moreover, several approaches are presented to solve problems and help to prevent future problems. The results of this research point to the main approaches to requirements testing and their use in academia and industry, as well as the advantages and disadvantages. The shortcomings allow us to suggest new research in safety-critical systems in the scope of validation, verification, specification, and testing of safety requirements, as well as to integrate test teams with requirements engineers in order to get better results. Based on the results, we suggest future studies for improvements in the requirements testing techniques to improve the integration of safety requirements and test cases.",

The dynamic conditions under which FI applications must execute call for self-adaptive software to cope with unforeseeable changes in the application environment. Models@run.time is a promising model-driven approach that supports the runtime adaptation of distributed, heterogeneous systems. Yet frameworks that accommodate this paradigm have limited support to address security concerns, hindering their usage in real scenarios. We address this challenge by enhancing models@run.time with the concepts of trust and reputation. Trust improves decision-making processes under risk and uncertainty and constitutes a distributed and flexible mechanism that does not entail heavyweight administration. This chapter introduces a trust and reputation framework that is integrated into a distributed component model that implements the models@run.time paradigm, thus allowing software components to include trust in their reasoning process. The framework is illustrated in a smart grid scenario.",

During the 1960s and early 1970s there was a very substantial investment in model-building associated with water quality management projects, particularly in the United States. The main legacy of this initial investment is a well-established interest in the development of progressively larger and more complex simulation models. ``Large'' is admittedly a rather imprecise description of a model, although a glance at some of the recent literature on water quality modeling will give some impression of the intended meaning (for example, Russell, 1975; Patten, 1975, 1976; J{\o}rgensen and Harleman, 1978; Scavia and Robertson, 1979). There is no doubt that the immense scope for complex system simulation created by the advent of electronic computers has fostered the rapid growth of ``large'' water quality models.",

abstract="The OMG standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has been on the market for about thirteen years. This standard is an extended subset of UML providing a graphical modeling language for designing complex systems by considering software as well as hardware parts. Over the period of thirteen years, many publications have covered various aspects of SysML in different research fields. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic mapping study about SysML to identify the different categories of papers, (i) to get an overview of existing research topics and groups, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to uncover possible missing links. We followed the guidelines for conducting a systematic mapping study by Petersen et al. (Inf Softw Technol 64:1--18, 2015) to analyze SysML publications from 2005 to 2017. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest in SysML in the last years particularly in the research field of Software Engineering, (ii) SysML is mostly used in the design or validation phase, rather than in the implementation phase, (iii) the most commonly used diagram types are the SysML-specific requirement diagram, parametric diagram, and block diagram, together with the activity diagram and state machine diagram known from UML, (iv) SysML is a specific UML profile mostly used in systems engineering; however, the language has to be customized to accommodate domain-specific aspects, (v) related to collaborations for SysML research over the world, there are more individual research groups than large international networks. This study provides a solid basis for classifying existing approaches for SysML. Researchers can use our results (i) for identifying open research issues, (ii) for a better understanding of the state of the art, and (iii) as a reference for finding specific approaches about SysML.",

abstract="With the emerging IoT and Cloud-based networked systems that rely heavily on virtualization technologies, elasticity becomes a dominant system engineering attribute for providing QoS-aware services to their users. Although the concept of elasticity can introduce significant QoS and cost benefits, its implementation in real systems is full of challenges. Indeed, nowadays systems are mainly distributed, built upon several layers of abstraction, and with centralized control mechanisms. In such a complex environment, controlling elasticity in a centralized manner might strongly penalize scalability. To overcome this issue, we can conveniently split the system in autonomous subsystems that implement elasticity mechanisms and run control policies in a decentralized manner. To efficiently and effectively cooperate with each other, the subsystems need to communicate among themselves to determine elasticity decisions that collectively improve the overall system performance. This new architecture calls for the development of new mechanisms and efficient policies. In this chapter, we focus on elasticity in IoT and Cloud-based systems, which can be geo-distributed also at the edge of the networks, and discuss its engineering perspectives along with various coordination mechanisms. We focus on the design choices that may affect the elasticity properties and provide an overview of some decentralized design patterns related to the coordination of elasticity decisions.",

abstract="One of the most common problems faced by planners, whether in industry or government, is optimisation---finding the optimal solution to a problem. Even a one percent improvement in a solution can make a difference of millions of dollars in some cases. Traditionally optimisation problems are solved by analytic means or exact optimisation methods. Today, however, many optimisation problems in the design of embedded architectures involve complex combinatorial systems that make such traditional approaches unsuitable or intractable. Genetic algorithms, instead, tackle these kind of problems by finding good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Their successful application, however, relies on algorithm parameters which are problem dependent, and usually even depend on the problem instance at hand. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive parameter control method for genetic algorithms, which adjusts parameters during the optimisation process. The central aim of this work is to assist practitioners in solving complex combinatorial optimisation problems by adapting the optimisation strategy to the problem being solved. We present a case study from the automotive industry, which shows the efficiency and applicability of the proposed adaptive optimisation approach. The experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed approach outperforms optimisation methods with pre-tuned parameter values and three prominent adaptive parameter control techniques.",

abstract="iStar is a goal-based requirements modelling language, being used in both industrial and academic projects of different domains. Often the language is extended to incorporate new constructs related to a particular application domain or to adjust it to practical situations during requirements modelling. Currently, the language is undergoing standardisation, and several studies have focused on the analysis of iStar variations to identify similarities and to define a core. This does not imply or constrain the need for iStar to continue to be extended. This paper contributes to the understanding of how iStar is extended by analysing how iStar researchers perform iStar extensions. To address this question, we followed a qualitative approach based on interviews involving 20 researchers from different research groups that proposed iStar extensions. The analysis revealed a good understanding about what extending a modelling language means and pointed out differences about how extensions are proposed. We discovered categories that impact positively on iStar extensions (such as reusing existing extensions, proposing extensions in abstract and concrete syntaxes, and creating new modelling tools), and other categories that impact negatively (such as modifying representations of the original constructs, proposing extensions in an ad hoc fashion and not carefully choosing graphical representations). We also evaluated the findings of interviews through an online survey answered by 30 iStar researchers. Finally, we proposed a set of guidelines to support the proposal for better future iStar extensions.",

In particular, we provide a set of formal definitions where norms are conceived for regulating a system at a higher level of abstraction (i.e., goal level) and the norm compliance is related to the satisfiability of business process goals.",

abstract="Supply Networks (SN) are complex systems involving the interaction of different actors, very often, with different objectives and goals. Among the different existing modeling approaches, agent-based systems can properly represent the autonomous behavior of SN links and, simultaneously, observe the general response of the system as a result of individual actions. Most of research using agent-based modeling in SN focuses on production issues. To the best of our knowledge, other relevant issues affecting SN competitiveness have not been fully studied such as the impact of customer's individual behavior or SN adaptability to changes in customer choices due to his/her decision-making context. In such a context, simulating SN oriented to the customer with context adaptability skills will allow researchers and practitioners to better look at ways to improve the relations between the SN and its customers, as well as to enhance SN's competitiveness. This paper presents our work in process about the design of an agent-based model of customer-oriented supply networks. Our focus is on the inclusion of the customer's purchase decision-making process and the SN adaptability. A preliminary model is developed based on a real-life case study from the floriculture sector in Colombia.",

Consequently, both academia and industry began significant research efforts in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent literature, covering 250+ publications, and highlighting key results. We outline a conceptual framework for cloud resource management and use it to structure the state-of-the-art review. Based on our analysis, we identify five challenges for future investigation. These relate to: providing predictable performance for cloud-hosted applications; achieving global manageability for cloud systems; engineering scalable resource management systems; understanding economic behavior and cloud pricing; and developing solutions for the mobile cloud paradigm.",

Thus, this study analyzes the ways academic and industrial communities have developed tools for building inclusive environments. The main findings of this review are: (1) an urgent need for the recognition of accessibility as an important non-functional requirement; (2) a need for taking into account the social conditions of users, such as illiteracy and people living in underserved communities; and (3) the identification of new research questions in the context of multi-device inclusive environments.",

abstract="In order to become more innovative, companies that operate in the Smart Living domain increasingly initiate and participate in networked business environments that transcend industry boundaries. Inter-organizational collaboration is often characterized by conflicting strategic interests and incoherent operational business processes and procedures. Although many scholars and practitioners use stakeholder analysis to gain insight into the actors' relationships and interactions, existing literature on stakeholder analysis focuses mainly on high-level strategic analysis, often limited to a conceptual and static understanding of stakeholder interests. In this paper, it is argued that a `true' understanding of stakeholders can be achieved by looking at their interactions and interdependencies at a more detailed level. This study uses a conceptual framework from the service innovation and business model domain, the VIP framework, to extend stakeholder analysis by including an analysis of their dynamic interactions and processes. The qualitative evaluation of the framework's application in illustrative design cases shows that this extension provides additional insights into stakeholders, and their potential operational conflicts and critical dependencies. By making these conflicts and interdependencies explicit, products and services are potentially easier to implement and commercialize.",

However, without proper V{\&}V, sufficient evidence to argue safety is not attainable. We propose in this work the use of a Safety Supervisor (SSV) to circumvent this issue. However, the design of an adequate SSV is a challenge in itself. To assist in this task, we present a conceptual framework and a corresponding metamodel, which are motivated and justified by existing work in the field. The conceptual framework supports the alignment of future research in the field of runtime safety monitoring. Our vision is for the different parts of the framework to be filled with exchangeable solutions so that a concrete SSV can be derived systematically and efficiently, and that new solutions can be embedded in it and get evaluated against existing approaches. To exemplify our vision, we present an SSV that is based on the ISO 22839 standard for forward collision mitigation.",

abstract="Cloud service providers typically compose their services from a number of elementary services, which are developed in-house or built by third-party providers. Personalization of composite services in mobile environments is an interesting and challenging issue to address, given the opportunity to factor-in diverse user preferences and the plethora of mobile devices at use in multiple contexts. This work proposes a framework to address personalization in mobile cloud-service provisioning. Service personalization and adaptation may be considered at different levels, including the user profile, the mobile device in use, the context of the user and the composition specification. The user's mobile device and external services are typical sources of context information, used in our proposed algorithm to elicit context-aware services. The selection process is guided by quality-of-context criteria that combine cloud-service provider requirements and user preferences. Hence, the paper proposes an integrated framework for enhancing personalized mobile cloud-services, based on a composition approach that adapts context information using a common model of service metadata specification.",

abstract="Software systems are increasingly expected to dynamically self-adapt to the changing environments. One of the principle adaptation mechanisms is dynamic recomposition of application components. This paper addresses the key issues that arise when external context knowledge is used to steer the run-time (re)composition process. In order to integrate such knowledge into this process, A Continuous Context-Aware Deployment and Adaptation (ACCADA) framework is proposed. To support run-time component composition, the essential runtime abstractions of the underlying component model are studied. By using a layered modeling approach, our framework gradually incorporates design-time as well as run-time knowledge into the component composition process. Service orientation is employed to facilitate the changes of adaptation policy. Results show that our framework has significant advantages over traditional approaches in light of flexibility, resource usage and lines of code. Although our experience was done based on the OSGi middleware, we believe our findings to be general to other architecture-based management systems.",

Examples of these technologies are the ``Blockchain technology'' which combines cryptographic mechanisms and peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture and ``Smart Data Discovery'' combining artificial intelligence and analytics. The importance of these emerging technologies requires the use of evalua-tion methods in order to understand their contribution and the associat-ed risks. The objective of this article is to propose a method supporting the evaluation of emerging technologies. A guidance approach is pro-posed. It is based on the recognition that emerging technologies are complex systems. Our approach combines three conceptual frame-works: the underlying theory of complex information systems, systems theory, and the ISO 25001 standard devoted to software quality. We propose a multi-criteria hierarchy which serves as the basis for the eval-uation. To illustrate this approach, we apply it to the particular cases of ``Blockchain'' technology and ``Smart Data Discovery''.",

Rapidly changing work environments need innovative paradigm-changing solutions for monitoring and following-up on each employees' professional progress, reducing the deviation between the competencies held by each employee and the core competencies required by the organization. Such gaps can become a critical risk factor and compromise the accomplishment of strategic and operational objectives.

The Visual Analytics contributes with interactive dashboards, by providing mechanisms to assist employees' self-awareness and presenting recommendations regarding competencies improvement, and Gamification techniques with Talent Management approaches to improve employees' auto-regulation, enabling the acquisition and motivation for new skills and competencies.

In this paper we provide an overview of our approach to realizing networks of proactive and co-operating smart products, starting from the requirements imposed by real-world scenarios. In particular, we present an ontology-based approach to modeling proactive problem solving, which builds on and extends earlier work in the knowledge acquisition community on problem solving methods. We then move on to the technical design aspects of our work and illustrate the solutions, to do with semantic data management and co-operative problem solving, which are needed to realize our functional architecture for proactive problem solving in concrete networks of physical and resource-constrained devices. Finally, we evaluate our solution by showing that it satisfies the quality attributes and architectural design patterns, which are desirable in collaborative multi-agents systems.",

This chapter builds in this direction by describing a distributed component-ware framework for autonomic and situation-aware communication developed within the CASCADAS project. The core of this framework is the Autonomic Communication Element (ACE), an innovative software abstraction capable of providing dynamically adaptable services that can be built, composed, and let evolve according to autonomic principles. Services are capable of adapting their logic to the dynamically changing context they operate in without human intervention. As a result, whenever the need arises, ACEs can be federated autonomously and produce new services on a situation-aware basis. Systems and, in particular, eco-systems can thus be conceived as collections of ACEs. The chapter introduces the concept of ACE and its different facets. It also presents the architecture of a prototype ACE-based platform and exemplifies the different concepts through a future Pervasive Behavioral Advertisement scenario.",

abstract="One of the biggest challenges in a Smart City is how to describe and dispose of the enormous and multiple sources of information, and how to share and merge it into a single infrastructure, in a timely and correct manner. A Smart City requires computational platforms, which allow the interconnection of multiple and embedded systems, such that the technology is integrated with people, and can respond to unpredictable situations. The integration of information and communications technology in these spaces, allows exploiting the wealth of information and knowledge generated in a Smart City, and improving its planning and services offered to its citizens. In this way, the people are immersed in these spaces, which are aware of their presence (context-sensitive) and adapt to their needs. The context analysis in a smart city allows making available services and information, to support ubiquitously the activities of the individuals. This study aims to analyze the emerging and ubiquitous capabilities of an Autonomic Reflective Middleware. The Middleware is based on intelligent agents that can be adapted to the existing dynamism in a city for, ubiquitously, responding to the requirements of citizens. It uses emerging ontologies that allow, not only the adaptation to the context of the moment and in real-time but also responds to unforeseen situations.",

abstract="Self-organisation is being recognised as an effective conceptual framework to deal with the complexity inherent to modern artificial systems. In this article, we explore the applicability of self-organisation principles to the development of multi-agent system (MAS) environments. First, we discuss a methodological approach for the engineering of complex systems, which features emergent properties: this is based on formal modelling and stochastic simulation, used to analyse global system dynamics and tune system parameters at the early stages of design. Then, as a suitable target for this approach, we describe an architecture for self-organising environments featuring artifacts and environmental agents as fundamental entities.",

abstract="The concept of change competence on which the Change Study is based is presented. Section 1 gives a general introduction to the problem of how individuals can recognize and name changes and processes of change in the complexity and dynamics of everyday life. In the examination of developmental psychological concepts, the scope for adaptive behavior is pointed out. Section 2 gives a brief outline of the development of the debate on the concept of competence. The concept of change competence is introduced as a general action competence and as a metacompetence to activate relevant individual competencies in the face of the challenges of specific situations. In dealing with the paradigms from the field of change management and in further developing the classical problem-solving and action theory, the concept of change competence of the IZZ Institute for Psychological Future Management establishes the four equivalent competence fields of orientation, stabilization, problem-solving and practice. The recognition, shaping and mastering of change processes is in turn understood as a dynamic, iterative, agile process in which the individual makes appropriate use of the various fields of competence. Finally, section 3 classifies individual situational change competence in the developmental psychological context of identity formation and personal development.",

abstract="Feature models have been used since the 90s to describe software product lines as a way of reusing common parts in a family of software systems. In 2010, a systematic literature review was published summarizing the advances and settling the basis of the area of automated analysis of feature models (AAFM). From then on, different studies have applied the AAFM in different domains. In this paper, we provide an overview of the evolution of this field since 2010 by performing a systematic mapping study considering 423 primary sources. We found six different variability facets where the AAFM is being applied that define the tendencies: product configuration and derivation; testing and evolution; reverse engineering; multi-model variability-analysis; variability modelling and variability-intensive systems. We also confirmed that there is a lack of industrial evidence in most of the cases. Finally, we present where and when the papers have been published and who are the authors and institutions that are contributing to the field. We observed that the maturity is proven by the increment in the number of journals published along the years as well as the diversity of conferences and workshops where papers are published. We also suggest some synergies with other areas such as cloud or mobile computing among others that can motivate further research in the future.",

abstract="Context-aware systems offer entirely new opportunities for application developers and for end users by gathering context information and adapting systems behavior accordingly. Several context models have been defined and various context-aware middleware has been developed in order to simplify the development of context-aware applications. Unfortunately, the development of an application by using these middleware products introduces several technical details in the application. These technical details are specific to a given middleware and reduce the possibility of reusing the application on other middleware. In this paper, we propose an MDD (Model Driven Development) approach that makes it possible to design context-aware applications independently of the platform. This approach is based on several phases that approach step by step the context platform and allow designers to automatically map their models to several platforms through the definition of automatic and modular transformations. To be able to apply this approach we define a new UML profile for context-aware applications, that we use to explore our approach.",

abstract="Quality function deployment (QFD) techniques transform customer demands to service techniques, reducing design lead time and providing enhanced services to meet customer demands. A poor, aging service design exerts a negative effect on the quality of life of elderly people. Because government agencies have limited resources, improvement items cannot be implemented simultaneously. In this study, the risk priority number of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) was employed to determine improvement priorities for service demands. This methodology facilitates constructing a comprehensive Aging in Place policy and increases effective use of resources. The Aging in Place categories and policies are crucial. QFD and FMEA techniques were used in this study to design an Aging in Place policy and meet elderly people demands, provide a clear design, and improve service quality to match the demands and expectations of elderly people. The 16 service demands were identified by the experts and scholars. Six management techniques were obtained: education and training, space planning, medical facilities, human resources, transportation facilities, and recreational activities. According to the results, priority was as follows: (1) education and training; (2) space planning; (3) human resources.",

abstract="Pervasive computing applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of inhabitants of the environment, such as their locations, activities, vital signs, and environmental measures. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in ``aging-in-place'' scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.",

pages="52--87",
abstract="Grid systems are complex computational organizations made of several interacting components evolving in an unpredictable and dynamic environment. In such context, scheduling is a key component and should be adaptive to face the numerous disturbances of the grid while guaranteeing its robustness and efficiency. In this context, much work remains at low-level focusing on the scheduling component taken individually. However, thinking the scheduling adaptiveness at a macro level with an organizational view, through its interactions with the other components, is also important. Following this view, in this paper we model a grid system as an agent-based organization and scheduling as a cooperative activity. Indeed, agent technology provides high level organizational concepts (groups, roles, commitments, interaction protocols) to structure, coordinate and ease the adaptation of distributed systems efficiently. More precisely, we make the following contributions. We provide a grid conceptual model that identifies the concepts and entities involved in the cooperative scheduling activity. This model is then used to define a typology of adaptation including perturbing events and actions to undertake in order to adapt. Then, we provide an organizational model, based on the Agent Group Role (AGR) meta-model of Freber, to support an adaptive scheduling at the organizational level. Finally, a simulator and an experimental evaluation have been realized to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

As example, four different proposals developed within the COST action IC0801 are detailed: (i) the MOISE organisation Model, which provides structural, functional and normative specifications of an organisation, and it is integrated in an Organisation Management infrastructure; (ii) the Virtual Organisation Model, which describes the structural, functional, dynamical, environmental and normative dimensions of an organisation, and it is complemented by the Virtual Organisation Formalization; (iii) the Agent-Oriented Modelling for sociotechnical systems, which are organisations consisting of human and man-made agents; and (iv) the AAOL agent architecture, in which groups of autonomous agents are organized in Localities. This chapter proposes a global comparison of different existing organisational models with the four detailed models in terms of the different description dimensions they propose.",

abstract="In modern societies, people live in spaces populated by a variety of computational elements, which generate new kinds of active cyber-entities interacting with each other and with humans, enabling new smart functionalities. Examples range from smart buildings such as modern office spaces, hospitals, airports and other public facilities up to entire smart cities. Such systems in which cyber and physical entities, particularly humans, are interacting in space may be collectively indicated as cyber-physical spaces (CPSp's). Many of these systems are part of critical infrastructures, and thus dependability in its various notions is a fundamental concern in their design and operation. To that end, the design of CPSp's should focus on dependability requirements since the early development stage, through modelling and continuous verification, until operation, where monitoring and run-time verification techniques ensure that the system complies with the requirements, even in the presence of possible changes and unforeseen system evolution. We argue that a holistic approach to achieve dependability of CPSp's must be founded on a formal specification of the requirements, on formal models of the system exposing well-defined semantics, and on automatic verification procedures which span the entire lifecycle from design to run-time. In this chapter, we illustrate the general approach which we are developing in our research and show how it can be instantiated and used in a case study reflecting a generalized operational environment of a critical facility.",

abstract="As new market opportunities, technologies, platforms, and frameworks become available, systems require large-scale and systematic architectural restructuring to accommodate them. Today's architects have few techniques to help them plan this architecture evolution. In particular, they have little assistance in planning alternative evolution paths, trading off various aspects of the different paths, or knowing best practices for particular domains. In this paper, we describe an approach for planning and reasoning about architecture evolution. Our approach focuses on providing architects with the means to model prospective evolution paths and supporting analysis to select among these candidate paths. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we show how it can be applied to an actual architecture evolution. In addition, we present some theoretical results about our evolution path constraint specification language.",

Additional contextual information regarding the patient's environment (e.g., location, data transmission device and underlying network conditions, etc.) is represented through an ontological knowledge base model. Rule-based evaluation determines proper content (i.e., biosignals, medical video and audio) coding and transmission of medical data, in order to optimize the telemedicine process.

abstract="Forest managers today are struggling with the great uncertainties and rapid changes in many biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of their work. We argue in this review that viewing forests and forest management as complex adaptive systems and acknowledging non-linearity and uncertainty in forest dynamics and management provide an alternative for both production- and conservation-oriented forests to the traditional command and control approaches that have been advocated so far in forestry. We first discuss the concepts of non-linearity and uncertainty in forest dynamics and management. We then propose a set of broad principles and approaches that are required for forest managers to better incorporate these new concepts into practices. These span from (1) relaxing and expanding the sustained-yield and single-good paradigm, (2) moving the target for assessing success in silviculture from predetermined strict outcomes for each and every stand to an envelope of possible outcomes that are acceptable for one or multiple stands, and (3) using approaches and modeling tools to assess as large a range of possible outcomes as possible instead of the traditional mainly deterministic and static modeling tools.",

abstract="Increasingly turbulent environments faced by enterprises today have reduced the time available to organisations to prepare and respond to change. Organisational agility, characterized by a rapid and proactive response to opportunities and threats, is a source of competitive strength and adaptive capability for engineering enterprises. Asset management can be an effective source of competitive advantage if it occurs within the broader framework of sustained organisational agility. This paper demonstrates how an understanding of the concept of agility, and obtaining a simple measure of the levels required in an organisation, can help managers to incorporate agility into their asset management programs. The Agility Measure described in the paper draws on experience with a large multi-national project, SYMPHONY, in which many small and medium-sized enterprises participated. A key feature of the Agility Measure is its applicability in medium sized enterprises which tend to have limited tools available to managers.",

journal="Journal of Simulation",
year="2011",

day="01",
volume="5",
number="3",
pages="135--146",
abstract="In modelling and simulation, ontologies can be used for the formal definition of methods and techniques (methodological ontologies), as well as for the representation of parts of reality (referential ontologies), like manufacturing or military systems, for example. Such ontologies are two sided: they are both models of a certain body of knowledge and models for automated information processing and further implementation. The first function of ontologies as pre-images (models of) has a strong epistemic nature especially for referential ontologies since they try to capture pieces of the `semantic relations of the real world'. The second function as models for further processing, in contrast, is completely normative in nature---it is a specification of a `formal semantics'. Unfortunately, the ideal realization of ontologies as epistemic models differs from the normative ideal. As specifications, ontologies have to be as precise (unequivocal) as possible; as representations of reality, in contrast, they have to be as descriptive as possible, which may imply ambiguity and even inconsistency in some domains. Ontology processing is particularly challenging as balancing these ideals is a domain specific task. The paper scrutinizes possibilities and fundamental limits for such a balance with a focus on simulation model interoperability and ontology-driven development based on experiences with ontologies in military projects.",

The proposed framework is built on a set of specific metrics that translates the high level reliability of a service, which are calculated at various levels of the choreography, focusing on four main dimensions: technical capacity and performance, product or service purchased, customer satisfaction perspective, and provider's and business partners' choreography.

Problems related to hydrology often deal with imprecision and vagueness, which can be very well handled by fuzzy logic-based models. This paper reviews a variety of applications of fuzzy logic in the domain of hydrology and water resources in brief. So far in the literature, fuzzy logic-based hybrid models have been significantly applied in hydrologic studies. Furthermore, in this paper, the literature is reviewed on the basis of applications using pure fuzzy logic models and applications using hybrid-fuzzy modeling approach. This review suggests that hybrid-fuzzy modeling approach works well in many applications of hydrology when compared with pure fuzzy logic modeling.",

abstract="GISs are moving away from a system for experts to a more widely-used tool for answering spatial-related questions. The dawn of new technologies on the horizon, such as telecommunication, mobile Internet, and handheld computing devices, offers new chances to the everyday use of geoinformation. However, the existing approaches to mobile visualisation of geoinformation mostly have a commercial background and are rather technology-centred. This quite narrow view ignores many relevant problems and does not fully profit from the new possibilities a mobile cartography could provide. Taking the existing problems into account the paper sketches a general conceptual framework for geoinformation use in a mobile environment. Specific user tasks and requests in a mobile environment are identified, which is followed by an outline of possible methods to personalise a GIS for better mobile assistance. Putting emphasis on the importance of analytical functions for mobile cartography, the process of adaptive and dynamic generation of visualisations for mobile users on the basis of vector data (e.g. SVG) is illustrated and the key research fields involved are pointed out.",

abstract="The term ``paradigm'' gained prominence after the original publication of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn in 1962 and has since been applied in multiple contexts, scientific and otherwise (Earman 1993, 19; McMullin 1993, 56ff.; Kuhn 1996). Information technology is consistent with this paradigm-shifting view of scientific revolution. Electronic commerce, the newest addition to the succession of information technology paradigms, grows progressively on an unprecedented scale. Momentous changes in the performance of deployed systems, the organizational structure, and the corporate value chain strongly influence this new paradigm (Beam and Segev 1996; Brandtweiner and Scharl 1999b, 8). The unprecedented success and rapid evolution of electronic commerce is not only grounded on the World Wide Web's simple means for authoring documents and accessing its vast resources, but also in its effective support for a variety of communication models of diverse complexity. The evolution of mediated forms of communication rarely leads to their extinction. Unsurprisingly, computer-mediated environments such as the World Wide Web are no exception. However, whereas deployed systems and established communication models may not go into instant extinction, they will be radically transformed by the emergence of new technologies.",

abstract="The need for complex systems has grown in recent years to react to the different requirements arisen in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent environment. Examples range from air traffic control systems, systems managing transactions on the stock exchange or environmental monitoring systems. The increasing complexity of such systems brings to the higher complexity of project management activities, which requires the review of commonly used methodologies to provide a better response to expectations of success for the planned projects. In this work we present a method for project monitoring and control based on the idea of a project view: given an analysis dimension such as time, cost and quality, each participant in the project has its own view on the project execution. The unavoidable differences between the views of various stakeholders have been formalized in the function {\$}{\$}gap{\$}{\$}gapthat can be interpreted as an inverse measure of the degree of consonance between two participants with respect to the dimension of considered analysis. The method can leverage on the consonance seeking among stakeholders as a reduction factor of project risks.",

abstract="The natural water system provides direct or indirectly numerous goods and services. For a long time these goods and services have been used to support society in various and important ways. We can distinguish visible and fast renewable resources as fish, crops, timber, and drinking water that distinctively can be linked to the water system. The water system also supports society through direct or indirect ecological services. The strong interdependence from the water system initially forced a certain harmony between the water system and its users. A combination of growing needs and a technological ability has resulted in an increased control and manipulation of the water system. These developments have also led to a serious degeneration of the system's carrying capacity. The emergence of the first major environmental problems has led to the development of a fragmented water management approach. Initially focused on finding technological ``end of pipe'' solutions to maintain anthropogenic user functions. Over the last few decades, this fragmented and compartmental approach has shown little adequacy and led to a growing awareness that an integrated and holistic approach is necessary.",

abstract="Accessibility and equal opportunities for all in the digital age have become increasingly important over the last decade. In one form or another, the concept of accessibility is being considered to a greater or smaller extent in most projects that develop interactive systems. However, the concept varies among different professions, cultures and interest groups. Design for all, universal access and inclusive design are all different names of approaches that largely focus on increasing the accessibility of the interactive system for the widest possible range of use. But, in what way do all these concepts differ and what is the underlying philosophy in all of these concepts? This paper aims at investigating the various concepts used for accessibility, its methodological and historical development and some philosophical aspects of the concept. It can be concluded that there is little or no consensus regarding the definition and use of the concept, and consequently, there is a risk of bringing less accessibility to the target audience. Particularly in international standardization the lack of consensus is striking. Based on this discussion, the authors argue for a much more thorough definition of the concept and discuss what effects it may have on measurability, conformance with standards and the overall usability for the widest possible range of target users.",

Considering the complexity of residential water use system, an agent-based social simulation, i.e. the Residential Water Use Model (RWUM), is developed in this paper to capture the behavioral characteristics of residential water usage. By disaggregating total water demands down to constituent end-uses, this model can evaluate heterogeneous consumer responses on water, taking into account the factors of market penetration of water-saving technologies, regulatory policies, economic development, as well as social consciousness and preferences. Also, uncertainty analysis technique is innovatively applied in this agent-based model for parameter calibration and model robust testing. According to the case study in Beijing, this model can provide insights to water management agency in evaluating different water usage polices, as well as estimations for potential water saving for future infrastructure development planning.",

However, the diversity of the sources of context information and the characteristics of the computing devices strongly impact the quality of context information in pervasive computing environments. Quality of Context parameters can be used to characterize the quality of context information from different aspects. In this paper, we quantify the Quality of Context parameters to present them in a suitable form for use with the applications in pervasive environments. We also present a mechanism to tailor the Quality of Context parameters according to the needs of an application and then evaluate these parameters. Enrichment of context information with Quality of Context parameters enhances the capabilities of context-aware systems to effectively use the context information to adapt to the emerging situations in pervasive computing environments.",

pages="267--283",
abstract="Environmental and health risk assessment projects involve processing of a large volume of uncertain information. To reduce uncertainties in the assessment process, the risk assessor evaluates a large volume of data from toxicological, exposure and health related databases. Being a data intensive assessment, for improved risk assessment, there is a need for these data to be harmonized and integrated by incorporating information from various sources and biological organizational criteria (e.g., gene, cellular, tissue, organ level health effects, if available). The main objective of this study is to have a front end or upstream approach towards an effective dynamic data fusion (DF)-based risk assessments. To achieve this goal, a generalized human health risk assessment and a system biology-based DF framework have been proposed. The proposed approach would be able to detect different trends and patterns and integrates various toxicological datasets from different biological organizational criteria (e.g., gene, cellular, tissue, organ level, if available) and integrates data from disparate sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, both the proposed frameworks have been implemented in human health risk assessment for benzene originated from an illustrative example of a contaminated site. The application in this study shows that this approach can increase the efficiency of dynamic data integration and incorporation of toxicity pathway or system biology-based information in the human health risk analysis. Currently, the system biology facilitated DF framework is based on hypothesis driven modeling relationships between different bio-organizational criteria. Further work is needed to prove these relationships. For a data rich chemical example such as benzene, these relationships can be established based on the existing and the emerging knowledge-base on benzene toxicology.",

abstract="Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water. Although it is a relatively stable and protected water resource, its quality, especially in highly urbanized catchments, is vulnerable to pollution related to unusual events or accidents causing releases of hazardous substances. To ensure the safe supply of drinking water in these cases, prompt actions must be taken and solutions must be delivered under time constraints. This paper describes a decision support system for emergency groundwater management that was developed to improve activities after the discovery of pollution in the catchments of drinking water abstraction wells in the Ljubljansko polje aquifer. It is a system based on a monitoring network and the integration of numerical modeling techniques with expert knowledge. The integration of logically interlinked activities, including the detection of pollution in the groundwater, the simulation of pollution propagation and decision making, into a common system provides a basis for proactive water resource management. The user-friendly interface enables water managers to utilize modeling tools and rapidly access information for mitigating pollution of groundwater resource, which in the presented case significantly contributes to a safer drinking water supply.",
