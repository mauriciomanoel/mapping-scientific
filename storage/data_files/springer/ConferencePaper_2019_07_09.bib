abstract="Cities all over the world are becoming increasingly smarter, including Dubai Smart City. The Smart Cities vision is to automate critical public services, make improvements for community interaction, and achieve significant levels of efficiency in a connected and technology-driven society, such as in traffic control. However, this has positioned Smart Cities to be a target of compromised Cyber Security, which can potentially undermine the information systems of local departments, general security, law enforcement, and transport systems. Dubai is a dynamic and emerging economy that has the potential to become a major economic center of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region owing to its strength in strategic information. The main purpose of this paper is to explore, evaluate, and discuss components of overall strategic security, innovation, management, and the development of Dubai in terms of Cyber Security. This study also showcases conducted survey results based on the Smart City Cyber Security program. Furthermore, it demonstrates the current and future challenges faced by Smart Cities from cyber-threats, including the development of strategic security plans to defend against sophisticated cyberattacks, and encourages citizens to take responsibility and implement awareness of how to proactively counter cyberattacks on Smart Cities. However, it is imperative to evaluate the strategies that are required to prepare Dubai's Electronic Security Center to align with Dubai Vision 2021 in order for Dubai to be one of the securest Smart Cities in terms of Cyber Security around the globe. This research aims to argue that to develop Dubai's Electronic Security Center, strategies should be a top priority for Dubai to ensure the security of the Smart City and to diminish cybercrime in Dubai.",

However, such procedures can also lead to user privacy issues. This study describes what citizens do and do not know about Wi-Fi tracking and how that knowledge affects their responses to privacy and security risks. The results of this study showed that there is a lack of awareness towards Wi-Fi tracking by people in the municipality studied. The results show that most respondents are willing to cooperate with Wi-Fi tracking, despite the fact that most people have concerns of losing control about how their data is gathered and used. This study also found that respondents indicated Wi-Fi tracking as useful and especially safety is appointed as an important benefit of Wi-Fi tracking. The results of this study confirm that privacy, trust and perceived benefits significantly influence the willingness to disclose personal information.",

This rapid urbanization of the planet presents great challenges and, at the same time, great opportunities. On the one hand, the concentration of people in urban spaces provides numerous economies of scale but, on the other hand, also implies the potential generation of negative externalities that must be managed by a ``smarter city'' to find a balance. Mobility in cities, the fact that moving in a vehicle (fuel, electric, shared, autonomous), public transport or other means is becoming a common, difficult and complex congestion problem for cities, has negative economic consequences. This enormous pressure for efficiency and the search for solutions are making significant inroads into the incorporation of ICT in smart cities and subsequent large-scale digitization to resolve this issue and other setbacks. This deployment needs to be conducted with a broad perspective incorporating economics and human concepts such as digital assets or citizen incentives in city strategies because in cities, people and resources are key players.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) introduces many intelligent applications that are closely attached to humans' daily activities. This advanced technology attempts to bridge the gap between the information world and the physical world. Recent studies investigate efficient, flexible, scalable and reliable IoT systems that not only control things and devices on behalf of humans but adaptable to humans' preferences. However, the autonomous control of the IoT in a smart home or healthcare environment subjects to many factors such as human health, time and date. For example, peoples' needs and behaviours during workdays differ from weekends or a young person needs and behaviours differs from an elderly person. Hence, the practical setting of a smart home entails flexible management to the autonomous control of IoT systems. This paper proposes an architecture of Adjustable-Autonomous Multi-agent IoT (AAMA-IoT) system to resolve a number of the IoT management of control and application interface challenges. The AAMA-IoT is applied in an elderly smart home simulation in which autonomous agents control passive things such as a chair or door and active things such as a television or an air conditioner. The test results show that the AAMA-IoT system controls 14 things with average activities recognition accuracy of 96.97{\%}.",

In this paper, we present a novel depression-monitoring system that infers an elderly's changes in depression level based on his/her activity patterns, extracted from wireless sensor data. To do so, we build predictive models to learn the relationship between depression level changes and behaviors using historical data. We also deploy the system for a group of elderly, in their homes, and run the experiments for more than one year. Our experimental study gives encouraging results, suggesting that our IoT system is able to correctly identify >80{\%} of the elderly at risk of becoming more depressed, with a very low false positive rate.",

abstract="To realize the Internet-based sociotechnical systems, it is necessary to build a comprehensive and effective infrastructure to support the interaction between various cloud services on the Internet and the physical world in which we live. For example, the information produced by the sensors is usually aggregated, processed and analyzed by services in the cloud, which can be used by various stakeholders for decision-making in many different application fields. Therefore, we need to consider integrating the Internet of Services (IoS), which enables the flexible sharing and composition of cloud services on the Internet, with the Internet of Things (IoT), which represents the constellation of things equipped with various sensors and actuators. The integration of IoS and IoT often involves multiple parties and so must deal with complex issues such as interaction, dynamics, scalability and decision making, all of which can be studied from a multiagent perspective. In this paper, we start by discussing the necessities and challenges for integrating IoS and IoT. Then, we propose an integrated architecture and examine it from two multiagent perspectives. One is to regard the integrated architecture of IoS and IoT as a multiagent-based architecture considering various patterns of service composition and interaction. The other is to apply multiagent methodologies when designing sociotechnical systems for various application domains based on the integrated IoS/IoT architecture. Moreover, we use the example application of designing multilingual environments to discuss the above two perspectives with possible future research directions.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) has become most rising technology in IT. The IoT world becomes very smaller, and the possibilities of IoT are endless. The center of attention of IoT is in the area of smart health, industrial (real-time analytical, automation) education, smart farming, connected home (security thermostats), connected cities (like smart meters). Although Internet of things (IoT) is becoming the essential aspect of every person's life and making the life comfortable, on the other side there are some challenges and problems which are also found in the Internet world. These issues make the smart world more unsafe and challenging like privacy issue, security, reliability, scalability, and interoperability. In these days, problem of incompatibility of devices is at high risk that makes things more expensive. So there is a need to tackle the interoperability problem. This paper proposed a model-driven approach (MDA) for making devices compatible. In the thesis, authors worked on platform independent model (PIM) and computation independent model. Computation independent model (CIM) is captured for the information and transferred into the platform independent model and Unified Modeling Language (UML) tool generate the Java code as a vocabulary.",

abstract="Indoor environment quality (IEQ) has a significant impact on health and in all human activities. On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterised by numerous pollution sources that can lead to relevant unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, experimental testing requires the supervision of several indoor parameters, such as the case of thermography experiments. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies, there is a great potential to create automatic solutions for IEQ supervision. In fact, due to people spend about 90{\%} of our lives indoors, it is crucial to monitor the IEQ in real-time to detect unhealthy conditions to quickly take interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health. Buildings are responsible for about 40{\%} of the global energy consumption, and over 30{\%} of the CO2 emissions; also a considerable proportion of this energy is used for thermal comfort. This paper aims to present a solution for real-time supervision of laboratory environmental conditions based on IoT architecture named iLabM. The solution is composed by a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and smartphone compatibility for data consulting. The iLabM provides temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and qualitative air quality data supervision in real-time. The smartphone application can be used to access the collected data in real time but also provides the history of the IEQ data. The results obtained are promising, representing a significant contribution to IEQ monitoring systems based on IoT.",

In order to enable IoT applications for critical and/or sensitive use cases, it is important to (i) foster their dependability by assuring and verifying the integrity and correctness of data processed in such applications, and (ii) adequately account for privacy and confidentiality concerns. For addressing these requirements, IoT systems can be equipped with data provenance mechanisms for maintaining information on the lineage and ownership of data. However, in order to provide secure and dependable IoT systems, provenance data needs to be sufficiently protected against tampering and unauthorized access.

In this paper, the contradiction between the design of smart home products and the demands of the elderly in daily life is studied under the mode of medical care and pension, as well as case analysis of smart home products for the elderly. The purpose of the paper is to study the type and interaction design of smart home products for the aged. The main method is through the investigation and user analysis of smart home, finding the principles and characteristics of interaction design from the products. Research shows that intelligent products can be divided into three types under the mode of medical and pension: smart home appliances, smart home management system and call monitoring system. Through the mobile Internet, intelligent terminal and touch screen control, smart home can meet the needs of the elderly users seamless, which will be a trend in the design of smart home products.",

abstract="By following previously conducted studies by various researchers, private corporations, and public offices around the globe, people have found out various loopholes not only regarding the ground aspects of a failing system but also the somewhat manipulated officials who generally short come in fulfilling their duties toward a continuous development and modifications to our cities. Even though, every annual budget highlights the capital investment made for the growth of various services fabricated for a city, I am still unable to provide an impact for the public, which results in an overall failure of our master plan to provide for a better living of the public. In this paper, I focused on the facts and hurdles that an administration faces while trying to deliver smart services to develop a smart city. In that framework, I included six of the most essential domains that have already been introduced in two major smart cities in India which can effectively contribute in the enhancement of currently developing models of smart city which were used by those two cities earlier. Altogether, I elaborated how each component has proved its worth in either one or both the cities and integrate it into a new developed model. Using the devices which used the concepts of things based on Internet, I formed conclusion regarding how a city can be upgraded into a smart city taking the lessons from two of the already declared smart cities, Jaipur (JAI) and New Delhi (DEL).",

abstract="This study provides a conceptual framework for a smart home with an embedded electronic health (e-Health) support, utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and driven by fuzzy logic. A review of existing frameworks in the related field was made to provide a basis for the proposed framework. The proposed framework was then modeled, and the fuzzy logic system to assist in the decision making process of the system was designed using MATLAB. The fuzzy system was found useful in utilizing inputs from sensors in the smart home to process in the rule base and generate responses to provide support for the sick or aged inhabitants of a smart home. The full scale implementation of the framework in existing smart homes may offer an additional efficiency in the IoT services in healthcare support.",

abstract="Internet-of-Things (IoT) is one of the most important new paradigms and technological advances in the realm of the soon-to-be-present-in-every-household (and nearly every business), Internet-powered cyber-physical systems of this decade and likely years to come. We are interested in the distributed intelligence, agent-based programming and multi-agent systems aspects of what it will take to enable the reliable, secure, inter-operable and human-friendly Next-Generation IoT, and in particular, Internet-of-Agents (IoA) as the IoT's software and computational intelligence foundation. Several key software design and computational intelligence aspects of IoT/IoA are discussed in this paper. We first address suitable programming abstractions for the software agents that would provide IoT's inter-operability, enabling different users, devices and platforms to effectively communicate and coordinate with each other. We then review some desiderata for the Next-Generation (NG) IoT middleware design. To address cyber-security for IoT holistically, we outline some elements of computational intelligence that would enable the self-healing and self-recovery capabilities of the NG IoT. We argue that the design of NG cyber-defense, self-healing and self-recovering mechanisms could greatly benefit from exploring paradigms from biology -- in particular, from the immune systems of living organisms. If such highly adaptable self-healing capabilities were built into the NG IoT, future cyber-attacks would cause much less disruption to the infrastructure and the end-users than what was the case with some recent cyber-attacks on the present-day IoT.",

abstract="Since the end of 2014 a definition on ``smart cities'' agreed by international standardization bodies exists. As commonly said in the business community, `measurement is the first step leading to control and eventually to improvement. If you can't measure something, you can't understand it. If you can't understand it, you can't control it. If you can't control it, you can't improve it' (H. James Harrington). Therefore, if we want to understand what the smart cities initiative is all about we have to start measuring its brand new definition. After that we'll be able to monitor and control the performance of cities in terms of smartness, and this will lead to the possibility of improvement. In this research we present a set of indicators that specifically serve to measure the newly agreed and acknowledged international definition on smart cities. This set of indicators will be now tested to measure the smartness of the city of Girona, a small-medium sized city in Spain. At the completion of this pilot we'll be able to design an index summarizing the set (or subsets) of indicators, as a future steps of this research. A summarizing index will help to get an overview and to understand the overall performance of a city in terms of smartness. Then, targeted actions should be undertaken according to the results revealed by the specific indicators so that the overall smartness can be improved.",

abstract="The safety of people and spaces is of paramount importance for societies. With time, the implementation of safety measures is rapidly changing from a need to a priority. Video surveillance systems play a key role in the surveillance of crucial and critical areas as these systems help the authorities keep places safer. With the rapid growth of technology and the implementation of the smart city concept, it is becoming possible to develop and deploy wide area surveillance systems. The ease with which these systems can be installed in private and public spaces (e.g., homes, streets and parks) allow for the creation of ubiquitous monitored environments. Rapid intervention responses to any abnormal situation or the use of recorded video as evidence are some advantages of the use of this type of surveillance systems. Although ubiquitous video surveillance systems are relevant for present modern societies, their cost is still high. To solve or, at least to mitigate this problem, a low-cost smart surveillance system was developed, which is presented and described in this paper. The developed surveillance system, based on available low-cost technology, can help keep critical spaces under surveillance 24/7. The proposed solution was found to have a minimal cost, a low bandwidth, and to be scalable and adaptable to every client's needs. Thus, the solution can be used by anybody (private and public) and applied in different contexts (e.g., residential, industrial). The system can provide still images, captured from surveillance video cameras, real time video and real time video processing, which can be used for motion detection. When this happens, the user is warned via an e-mail containing the identification of the respective surveillance camera. Only the relevant video events are sent, recorded and maintained in the cloud platform system, consequently reducing the amount of storage space required to maintain all the historical video events. The results of the tests carried out show that it is possible to stream a video from the surveillance cameras with an insignificant delay and that motion detection can be attained through real time video processing. The system presented potentiates a low-cost solution for a smart city in the surveillance field.",

abstract="The main body of research clearly highlights the world's population is rapidly expanding. When this fact is combined with the increase in life longevity due to medical and social advances it alters the demographic balance in relation to age. Hence, the number of people aged 65 and over is constantly increasing. The potential of Smart Technologies and IoT-based devices to improve health has increased rapidly in the last few years and users are now in a position to contribute to the development of the interaction process and need to be properly trained on benefits of using new technologies. IFTTT (If This Then That), Blockly, and other similar tools provide a new perspective on web-based services, and represent an innovative and inclusive instrument to manage small automated tasks between Internet-connected devices by using a simplified interaction approach. The main research question of this work is: how could senior users benefit and adopt smart devices in a proficient way and how can emerging technologies such as automation services enhance safety, health and well-being for people with different abilities? The research method is based on a participatory, Inclusive Design approach, developed through interviews and focus groups, among a restricted number of people of different age and gender, design and usability tests in the further stage. The aim of the work is to make existing technologies more accepted, usable and inclusive for as many people as possible. This goal will be achieved by analysis and by creating a set of interactive and easy to use information and tools for automating different processes, to improve the performance in Activities of Daily Living and increase the connection and socialization between citizens, their family and friends. Applets for Seniors could be seen as a different approach to enable users with different abilities in interacting in a friendly way with new technologies and could be also used as a User Experience facilitator for people who are not familiar with smart devices.",

Design of complex systems comprising of different IoT devices involves meeting of security requirements for the whole system. Creating a general security framework for such interconnected systems is a challenging task and currently we do not have standard mechanisms for securing such systems. The first step towards developing such a framework would be to build a classification mechanism which can identify the security capabilities or parameters of the different entities comprising an IoT system. In this paper we describe one such mechanism which can take user input to classify the different components of a complex system and thereby determine their capability to support security mechanisms of different degrees. This in turn would enable designers to decide what kind of security protocols they need to adopt to achieve end-to-end security for the whole system.",

abstract="The Internet-of-Things (IoT) ushers in a new age where the variety and amount of connected, smart devices present in the home is set to increase substantially. While these bring several advantages in terms of convenience and assisted living, security and privacy risks are also a concern. In this article, we consider this risk problem from the perspective of technology users in the smart home, and set out to provide a usable framework for modelling security and privacy risks. The novelty of this work is in its emphasis on supplying a simplified risk assessment approach, complete with typical smart home use cases, home devices, IoT threat and attack models, and potential security controls. The intention is for this framework and the supporting tool interface to be used by actual home users interested in understanding and managing the risks in their smart home environments.",

In a Human Smart City, people rather than technology are the true actors of the urban ``smartness''. The creation of a participatory innovation ecosystem in which, citizens and communities interact with public authorities and knowledge developers, in a collaborative mode, exploiting the power of co-designed user centered innovation services, is the driving force. The authors argue that the city challenges are more effectively addressed at the scale of neighbourhood and they provide cases and experiences that demonstrate the viability, importance and impact of this model.",

The objective of the framework is to serve as supportive tool for users to take privacy-related informed decisions. For example when buying a new fitness tracker, users could compare different models in respect to privacy friendliness or more particular aspects of the framework such as if data is given to a third party. The framework consists of 16 parameters with one to four yes-or-no-questions each and allows the users to bring in their own weights for the different parameters. We assessed 110 devices which had 94 different policies. Furthermore, we did a legal assessment for the parameters to deal with the case that there is no statement at all regarding a certain parameter. The results of this comparative study show that most of the examined privacy policies of IoT devices/services are insufficient to address particular GDPR requirements and beyond. We also found a correlation between the length of the policy and the privacy transparency score, respectively.",

IoT is a sum of entities that are used to exchange information in different contexts. This is a network of connected objects communicating between them to extend their functionalities [17]. The IoT is larger than just a system: it is a system of system. Each one can be divided in sub-system and assimilated to a specific technology [5]. The IoT is ``a dynamic infrastructure of a global network. This global network has auto-configuration capacities based on standards and communication protocols interoperable. In this network, physical and virtual objects have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities and smart interfaces and they are integrated to the network in a transparent way'' [31].",

The onset of electricity allowed more labour saving devices to be developed, again in the home and at work. These were typically `standalone' devices that needed localised control. In the 1940s industrial control systems were making their presence felt in industry. In 1978 the X10 protocol was patented and allowed remote control of electrical appliances. In the last twenty years there has been a thrust towards `smart everything', including cities, transport, health, home and work.

abstract="Internet of Things is mainly about connected devices embedded in our everyday environment. Typically, `interaction' in the context of IoT means interfaces which allow people to either monitor or configure IoT devices. Some examples include mobile applications and embedded touchscreens for control of various functions (e.g., heating, lights, and energy efficiency) in environments such as homes and offices. In some cases, humans are an explicit part of the scenario, such as in those cases where people are monitored (e.g., children and elderly) by IoT devices. Interaction in such applications is still quite straightforward, mainly consisting of traditional graphical interfaces, which often leads to clumsy co-existence of human and IoT devices. Thus, there is a need to investigate what kinds of interaction techniques could provide IoT to be more human oriented, what is the role of automation and interaction, and how human originated data can be used in IoT.",

One of the areas that are leading up to IoT is Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp). There are thus solutions such as frameworks, middlewares, and other development artifacts that come from the UbiComp community and can be used for IoT applications. On the other hand, the interaction evaluation of the applications can be more complex in IoT than in UbiComp systems, once we have two different perspectives: Human-Thing and Thing-Thing interactions. In this paper, based on the literature, our experience in these two domains, and case studies with Ubicomp and IoT applications, we discuss how we can benefit from the UbiComp move towards IoT, focusing on the main differences and similarities related to interaction evaluation.

This work proposes a coupling model, based on standards, technologies, and methodologies, able to make easy and effective the distribution, access, and use of data between services providers and citizens. The system architecture has been designed and developed by using the OSGi technology exploiting a support supplied by Docker, a platform able to ensure greater freedom in the modularization of software platforms oriented to micro-services. Furthermore, for higher levels, an approach based on the OneM2M standard has been adopted in order to obtain a middle layer useful to large-scale coordination of aspects related to the gathering, discovery, security and distribution of data and services.

However, elders' privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication or other reasons. To demonstrate how serious this issue is, we introduce in this paper a Privacy Mining Approach (PMA) to mine privacy from smart homes by conducting a series of deductions and analyses on sensor datasets generated by smart homes. The experimental results demonstrate that PMA is able to deduce a global sensor topology for a smart home and disclose elders' privacy in terms of their house layouts.",

This limitation can hamper user-driven innovation. In this paper we evaluate the usefulness of the ``app store'' metaphor as a means of sharing and deploying Internet of Things software among makers. We did a set of interviews and a questionnaire-based survey with a sample of makers in various maker communities. We used this data to extract requirements for an application store, using the common ``app store'' metaphor as a starting point. The app store concept was developed as a proof of concept implementation, and evaluated through feasibility evaluation and focus group evaluation methods. Our findings show that although the app store metaphor is familiar and easy to grasp, there are some fundamental challenges when adapting the metaphor: (1) The difficulty of supporting the diversity in the software and hardware vendor market, (2) The tension between context awareness and the need for pre-configuration and pre-packaging, and (3) usability challenges related to the number of devices and apps.",

This paper discusses requirements of the elderly people regarding skills in technologies and actual computer competency. The study, which is presented in this paper, brings findings from the research which was run by the authors on the local scene with a group of elderly people who attended computer courses within the frame of the `Internet for the Senior Citizens' intergeneration project. The project is annually organized by municipality and primary schools to improve computer literacy in the senior attendees. Researchers applied quantitative and qualitative methods. Results relating to the respondents' history in gaining computer skills showed that self-education and assistance from family members represent the main role in this field, nearly one third of attendees marked attendance of computer courses. As for skills, which the elderly would like to gain or practice, work with photography and files dominated. Most attendees were familiar with E-mail; they found learning to use Skype communication application more beneficial. The aim of the paper is to identify computer skills that the seniors attending the free courses would like have or develop in order to be able to participate partially or fully in Smart City without feeling `aside'. Research results were presented at the meeting of the directors and municipality representatives and are being incorporated into a next phase of the project with an updated design and content of the courses in a new learning environment.",

abstract="The increase in life expectancy and the consequent aging of the general population pose, nowadays, major challenges to modern societies. Most elderly people have the usual problems related to old age, like health chronic problems and sensory and cognitive impairments. Besides that, in today's modern societies, where families have less and less time to look after for their old relatives, the isolation of the elderly is a real concern and a very current problem, which is enhanced if the elders live alone. To solve or, at least, mitigate that problem, it was developed a smart home for elders that is presented and described in this paper. The developed assistive home system, which is based on available technology, can ensure the quality of life, safety and well-being of all older adults that want or desire to live in the comfort of their home, near to their friends and in their neighborhood, instead of living in elder care centers. The proposed solution can record and analyze the elders' daily routines in order to alert (e.g., e-mails or text messages) the family members and/or social agents (e.g., doctors and caregivers) whenever an unusual situation occurs or when the elder is in danger, provide real-time audio and video when necessary and some comfort features, such as, automatic lighting and temperature control. The relevant events are recorded and maintained in a cloud database, which can be accessed through a dedicated website or by an Internet of Things (IoT) Application Programming Interface (API). Although this type of solution/service is focused in the elderly population, anybody can use it. The developed solution provides comfort and safety to elders and, at the same time, an easier way of monitoring all important events.",

abstract="Air pollution is one of the pressing issues faced not only by human race but also by Earth's vegetation. There are numerous findings regarding the effects of air pollution, for instance air pollutants playing a notorious role in inducing asthma and in formation of acid rain. Apart from regular activities done by government like creating acts, setting standards and regular inspection in industries to provide people with pollution free environment, various mobile apps like Air Quality India, SAFAR Air have been developed and disseminated to create environmental awareness. But even then, air pollution persists due to gases from vehicles on roads, Choloro Fluro Carbon from home appliances, Carbon Monoxide from incomplete combustion of fuels or gas, particulate matters from cigarette smoking, cooking etc. Individuals are affected by these air pollutants which are predominant in the air they breathe in. It is necessary to educate people on how to ameliorate the effects of air pollutants and control air pollution. In this paper, we have presented a framework that utilizes data from social networks and supervised machine learning algorithm, which will facilitate in taking an initial step towards a smart environment in smart cities. A part of our proposed application was tested with a group of people. These experiments showed better accuracy in classifying people according to the place where they spend most of their time in a day, and also received good responses from the people.",

abstract="The technological advances in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have led to the generation of large amounts of data and the production of a large number of IoT platforms for their management. The abundance of raw data necessitates the use of data analytics in order to extract useful patterns for decision making. Current architectures for big data analytics in the IoT domain address the large volume and velocity of the produced data. However, they do not address the semantic heterogeneity in the data models used by diverse IoT platforms, which emerges when large-scale deployments, spanning across multiple deployment sites, are considered. This paper proposes an architecture for big data analytics in the context of large-scale IoT systems consisting of multiple IoT platforms. A Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) handles the interoperability among the data models of the individual platforms, using semantic mappings between them and a unified ontology. Data queries to the SIL and result collection is handled by a cloud-based data management layer, namely the Data Lake, along with storage of metadata needed by data analytics methods. Based on this infrastructure, web-based data analytics and visual analytics methods are used to analyze the collected data, while being agnostic of platform-specific details. The proposed architecture is developed in the context of healthcare provision for older people, although it can be applied to any IoT domain.",

abstract="The increasing percentage of elderly people in the population (at least in Europe and North America) is part of a demographic change that will have an enormous impact on the society in the next few years. Thus, intelligent solutions that rely on the Internet of Things have been proposed in the literature, with the final goal to give remote support to elderly people at their home. Those solutions aim at monitoring activities and behaviors, and automatically send alarms in case of anomalies, putting in contact the end-user with her/his GP or alerting the emergency center or familiars, according to the specific needs. However, although the great deal of worldwide researches in the area of the Internet of Things and its early applications to healthcare and teleassistance, the technologies to apply it in real-world with the necessary dependability levels are far from being assessed. In this paper, we propose novel software engineering concepts that, by synthesizing existing proposals bringing in the lessons of agent-based computing and agent-oriented software engineering, can effectively support the systematic (and thus more dependable) development of Internet of Things applications.",

abstract="Due to increased longevity, there has been a significant growth in the aging population world over. Caring for this burgeoning class has become a pressing challenge faced by many developed and emerging countries, including the US (the aging baby boomer) and China (the reverse 4-2-1 family pyramid due to one child policy). Despite failing health, most senior citizens prefer to live independently at home and hence the focus of current healthcare technologies has shifted from traditional clinical care to ``at-home'' care for the senior citizens. We propose to develop SilverLink, a system that is unique in its smart and connected technologies and will offer: (1) affordable and non-invasive home-based mobile health technologies for monitoring health-related motion and daily activities; (2) advanced mobile health analytics algorithms for fall detection, health status progression monitoring, and health anomaly detection and alert; and (3) a comprehensive health activity portal for reporting user activity and health status and for engaging family members. This review discusses the SilverLink system in detail along with some of the technical challenges faced during the development of this system and future opportunities.",

abstract="The aging of the population in most developed countries has increased the need of proposing and adopting systems to monitor the behaviour of elder people with cognitive impairment. Home monitoring is particularly important for caregivers and relatives, who are in charge of these persons in potentially risky environments (e.g., the kitchen, the bathroom, the stairs, go out alone to the street, etc.), while they perform their household activities. On the other hand, the paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) allows the interconnection of everyday objects to implement sophisticate, yet simple-to-use, computer systems. In this paper, we analyse the existing IoT-based proposals to monitor elder people at home. Moreover, we propose a generic design of an IoT-based home monitoring system that allows caregivers, relatives and/or emergency services to be notified of potentially risky demeanours. Finally, some scenarios or situations are presented in order to better understand the proposal, and to validate its design to cover some common use cases.",

abstract="The high cost of healthcare services, the aging population and the increase of chronic disease are becoming a global concern. Several studies have indicated the need for strategies to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. A promising trend in healthcare is to move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric). Moreover, recent advances in microelectronics, wireless, sensing and information have boosted the advent of a revolutionary model involving systems and communication technology, enabling smarter ways to ``make things happen''. This new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has a broad applicability in several areas, including healthcare. The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of this technology-based healthcare approach, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve the wellness of the patients, as well as a better application of government financial resources. Based on this context, this paper aims to describe a review to comprehend the current state and future trends for healthcare applications based on IoT infrastructure, and also to find areas for further investigations.",

abstract="The proportion of elderly people over 65 years old has rapidly increased, and social costs related to aging population problems have grown globally. The governments want to reduce these social costs through advanced technologies. The physician or medical center evaluates health conditions from the reports of elderly people. However, self-reports are often inaccurate, and sometimes reports by family or caregivers can be more accurate. To solve these problems, an evaluated objective method based on sensor data is needed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven smart home system that uses web technologies for connecting sensors and actuators. The proposed system provides a method of monitoring elderly people's daily activities using commercial sensors to register recognizable activities easily. In addition, it controls actuators in the home by using user-defined rules and shows a summary of elderly people's activities to monitor them.",

Due to the increasing number of IoT connected devices, the amount of generated data is increasing too. Processing huge amounts of data is complex due to the continuously running situation recognition algorithms. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an approach for optimizing the usage of situation recognition algorithms in Internet of Things domains. The key idea of our approach is to select important data, based on situation recognition purposes, and to execute the situation recognition algorithms after all relevant data have been collected. The main advantage of our approach is that situation recognition algorithms will not be executed each time new data is received, thus allowing the reduction of the situation recognition algorithms execution frequency and saving computational resources.",

However, the security issues arising from the scale of connectivity and heterogeneity of resources in IoT make it a hot target for attackers, where centralized security solutions fall short. The vulnerabilities in providing proper device authentication and data integrity in IoT networks have been shown to introduce devastating effects. This calls for designing a data security architecture for IoT, which can accurately authenticate devices by anyone in the network in a decentralized manner and prevent unauthorized modification of the stored data.

abstract="A Smart Verification Algorithm (SVA) used with Internet of Things (IoT) applications is proposed performing a verification procedure to enable authorized requests by user to access a smart system with help of Quick Response (QR) tag. It uses encrypted QR-tag values to compare them to original values. Three-layers have been proposed for this verification procedure to attain security objectives. The first layer implements a comparison to preserve the system integrated. In the second layer, original values are stored in offline database storage to disable any access caused by threats; to preserve it available. The third one frequently generates an authenticated QR tag using 1-session private key to prevent both information leakage and an unauthorized access if the key was deduced; to keep it confidential. The SVA aims to increase the system privacy. It is evaluated in terms of security factors. Results confirm that it is faster than other competitive techniques. Additionally, results have discussed SVA's robustness against unauthorized access's attempts and brute force attack.",

abstract="Indoor air quality parameters are extremely important to create a productive and healthy indoor environment however in many cases the air quality parameters are very different from those defined as healthy values. Considering that we spend about 90{\%} of our lives indoors, it is extremely important to monitor the indoor air quality in real time to detect problems in the quality of air and plan interventions in the building, or in the ventilation systems in order to improve air quality. This paper aims to present a solution for indoor air quality monitoring based in Internet of Things Architecture (IoT). This solution is composed by a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and a web and smartphone compatibility for data consulting. This system, denominated by iAQ Wi-Fi, is based on open-source technologies. It is a totality Wi-Fi system, with several advantages compared to existing systems, such as its modularity, scalability, low cost and easy installation. This system performs real-time data collection that is stored in a ThingSpeak platform. The system has smartphone compatibility which allow easier access to data in real time. In this application, the user can check the latest data collected by the system and access to the history of the air quality parameters in graphical representation. iAQ Wi-Fi uses a open-source Arduino UNO as processing unit, a ESP8266 for Wi-Fi 2.4 GHZ as communication unit and incorporates an temperature and humidity sensor, a CO2 sensor, a dust sensor and a digital light sensor as sensing unit.",

Despite failing health, most senior citizens prefer to live independently at home and hence the focus of current healthcare technologies have shifted from traditional clinical care to ``at-home'' care for the senior citizens. We propose to develop SilverLink, a system that is unique in its smart and connected technologies and will offer: (1) affordable and non-invasive home-based mobile health technologies for monitoring health-related motion and daily activities; (2) advanced mobile health analytics algorithms for fall detection, health status progression monitoring, and patient health anomaly detection and alert; and (3) a comprehensive patient health activity portal for reporting user activity and health status and for engaging with family members. This system will initially be launched in the US, in China and in Taiwan and will aim to overcome the limitations of existing home-care solutions.",

Acceptability of smart homes relies on the users' perceptions towards its benefits and their concerns related to monitoring and data sharing. Within this study, an online survey with 234 participants has been conducted to understand the attitudes and perceptions of future smart home users, followed by detailed analysis of their responses. In general, the users agree that the smart home technology would improve the quality of life to a greater extent and enhance the safety and security of residents. On the contrary, they raise several concerns such as the increased dependence on technology and the monitoring of private activities, which may be seen as perceived drawbacks. The obtained results show that the older adults (ages from 36 to 70 years) are more open to monitoring and sharing data especially if it useful for their doctors and caregivers while the young adults (ages up to 35 years) are somewhat reluctant to share information.",

abstract="The number of internet-connected devices (Internet of Things, IoT) is growing at an unstoppable rate. Many manufacturers have developed specific protocols that are usually closed and do not follow any standard, hindering the interconnection and coordination of devices from different manufactures. This entails a greater effort from users to coordinate some devices and the loss of the benefits provided by this paradigm. Some works are proposing different techniques to reduce this barrier and avoid the vendor lock-in issue. Nevertheless, this interconnection should also depends on the context. IoT devices must adapt their behavior according to the people's preferences around them. In this paper, we propose a system that allows to identify a dynamic interconnection of IoT devices arising from changing situations to help elderly people with their daily tasks and improve their quality of life. Our work allows us to make this interconnection context dependent, creating a collaborative environment between people and devices. Further, in a world with an accelerated population aging, there is an increasing interest on developing solutions for the elderly living assistance through IoT systems.",

In contrast with flagrant enthusiasm with regards to technology applications towards achieving such goal, threats to local governments continue to grow across the globe, while risks and concerns remain underexplored in research. By examining a survey where experts rate factors and risks in smart city development, this paper sheds light to an array of vulnerabilities that may be overlooked by public managers and executives and may compromise their smart cities goals. Expanding on literature, findings suggest the most critical smart city development factors are technological (infrastructure development, open data services, availability of information resources), organizational (clear KPIs, coordination procedures, strategic planning, creating business environment, transparency in decision-making) and social ones (preferences in getting e-services, human capital growth). Markedly, experts understood the most serious risks involve technological and social adaption. The results achieved could be of interest for counting risk factors in the emerging smart cities.",

abstract="The percentage of the world's population aged over 65 is growing at unprecedented rates. Many countries face the challenge of supporting an aging population despite increasing healthcare costs, and an insufficient number of caregivers. Emerging technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), can help. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are a good indicator of healthy aging and provide a baseline for detecting an elder's changes in physical and cognitive state. Monitoring and accurately classifying elders' activities helps prevent and mitigate some common risks faced by elders when they age-in-place. In our study, we partnered with a senior care provider to add sensors to five apartments in an independent living facility and provided the requisite 24/7 monitoring. Ambient sensors were deployed in each of the apartments and collected high-density IoT sensor data for six months for each of the study participants, who were all over the age of 70. While we successfully created a model to classify ADLs through the recognition and observation of patterns based on high-density ambient sensor placement, sensor data and semantics, and characteristics of activities, we discovered challenges in capturing every ADL for each participant. Often, the ADLs captured for each participant offered unique and personalized indicators of healthy aging. This paper explores the challenges of deploying consumer-grade, IoT, sensors, and the application of AI technology to learn and model elders' ADLs. We also share results of our exploration to classify ADLs in the data using manual crowd-sourcing, rule-based reasoning and machine learned analytics.",

abstract="Despite the complicated conditions in the food supply chain, we identify the risks in it based on the food related standards in China. We analyze the standards and summarize the types of the risks, then map them into the five main phases in the food supply chain, which are production, processing, transportation, storage and sale. The classification will help us to find the key risks in each procedure and take measures to mitigate them. We also investigate how to use the Internet of Things to mitigate the risks. Some of them can have been solved and some of them are solvable. However, we argue there are still some risks cannot be covered by the IoT technologies. We believe this research can help other researcher find how well the IoT technologies can resolve the food safety problem.",

In this paper, we focus on two of the numerous dimensions of IoT systems with which the users interact; (1) the IoT user interface and (2) the IoT ecosystem. Based on literature, we develop a model that identifies how data is presented to users and how users interact with the system, and the level at which systems interconnect with, and collects data from, multiple systems. Companies can use the model to assess their systems in order to identify the current state of their systems and to identify the desired state. Moreover, the model can be used to better understand the steps necessary for transforming from one dimension to another in order to develop more advanced IoT systems.",

Generally older people prefer to keep their independence as they age, which gives them a better quality of life. Independent living can be achieved both within care homes and at home, and with the assistance of technology this can be achieved more easily. In this study a Smart Home in a Box (SHIB) solution has been developed to support Ambient Assistive Living (AAL). This paper presents a solution for an interface to interact and be notified by the SHIB platform. A usability evaluation of the developed solution is also presented in the paper. This evaluation asked 8 people consisting of management staff and a Family and Relatives group from a care home, to determine how older people would feel about a solution like this. Overall the participants of the usability evaluation felt the developed solution would benefit older people living at home.",

But now smart home products are still at start-up period of product's development life cycle. What functions can attract consumption and are necessary? What functions are necessary but have no attraction? These function demands of users are not understood thoroughly. So far, there is no much study to differentiate varieties of function demands of smart home. In addition, their preference for requirements of smart home is different as different groups are different in consumption psychology and consumption behavior. For example, the consumption behavior of middle-aged group is rather conservative and youth group is active in thinking and likes to buy some new products and try new life. Therefore how to position the development of relative smart home products according to different target groups is an important subject needed to think.",

The results of the statistics show that the share of seniors in the Czech Republic has an increasing trend. The utilization of social networks by elderly people has in the Czech Republic also increasing trend except for the second quarter of the 2015 year when a slight decrease was recorded. In comparison with other countries from Visegrad group and the EU 28 the Czech Republic reached lower results in the utilization of social networks. In two evaluated criteria from three the Czech Republic was comparable to Poland. The age groups show that with increasing age there is a declining trend for the use of social networks. 10.1{\%} of the population from 55 to 64 years and 3.3{\%} of the population over 65 use social networks in the second quarter of 2015.

abstract="The Internet of Things is paving the way for the transition into the fourth industrial revolution with the mad rush of connecting physical devices and systems to the internet. IoT is a promising technology to drive the agricultural industry, which is the backbone for sustainable development especially in developing countries like those in Africa that are experiencing rapid population growth, stressed natural resources, reduced agricultural productivity due to climate change, and massive food wastage. In this paper, we assessed challenges in the adoption of IoT in developing countries in agriculture. We propose a cost effective, energy efficient, secure, reliable and heterogeneous (independent of the IoT protocol) three layer architecture for IoT driven agriculture. The first layer consists of IoT devices and it is made up of IoT driven agriculture systems such as smart poultry, smart irrigation, theft detection, pest detection, crop monitoring, food preservation, and food supply chain systems. The IoT devices are connected to the gateways by low power LoRaWAN network. The gateways and local processing servers co-located with the gateways create the second layer. The cloud layer is the third layer, which exploits the open source FIWARE platform to provide a set of public and free-to-use API specifications that come along with open source reference implementations.",

In our research work, we are using advances in Information Technology (IT), wireless communication, web-based technologies, and autonomics, to develop new, smart, and cost-effective solutions for the health wellness of the elderly. Such a solution would enable the elderly to lead independent lifestyles in their own homes while being continuously, non-invasively, and non-intrusively monitored for the early detection of symptoms, so diseases can be treated in the early stages; to promote health wellness; as well as to treat chronic illnesses. In this research paper, through a few examples, we will discuss our ongoing work and the challenges we have uncovered, plus some of the research issues we are pursuing. We will particularly focus on the critical role of IT in developing innovative, low-cost, and high impacting solutions to the pending elderly demographic crisis.

abstract="The exploitation of electrical equipment and the emergence of New Information and Communication Technologies (NICT), which led to a significant increase in electricity consumption. This article presents a decision-making tool for the choice of energy consumption, which makes it possible to ensure better energy efficiency. It examines how the semantic Web approach can be used to represent information about a resident, energy, behavior, and activities of residents. Ontology is the main element in this work because it represents information about concepts, properties, and relationships between concepts. This approach offers several advantages, such as sharing and reusing knowledge for good decision-making. We chose OWL (Ontology Web Language) for the formal representation of knowledge, SWRL rules (Semantic Web Rules) to present the intelligent reasoning of the solution, finally, the software Prot{\'e}g{\'e}2000 is used for the edition of knowledge. We applied our solution to a residence located in the city of Adrar in Algeria. This city is characterized by a climate and human activities specific to the region; these two characteristics have a great influence on the consumption of energy.",

abstract="This paper seeks to define the boundaries of Smart City research and to draw a map of the interdisciplinary community focusing on this emerging issue. To do so, we analysed the texts included in the websites of two major international Conferences on Smart Cities, and we used the Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach to examine a representative sample of 114 publications on Smart Cities. We found that Smart City research was hosted in Architecture and Social Sciences journals in the first place, but since 2007--2008 the interest in this issue boomed among Engineering and Computer Science scholars. Whilst there is a growing number of publications describing many ICT-enabled solutions for enhancing the competitiveness, sustainability and livability of cities, only few studies have addressed the organizational issues implied in such innovations so far. On the other side, our graph describing the interdisciplinary links within the 118 analysed publications shows that management studies occupy a strategic position within the interdisciplinary network of Smart City research. Then, Management and Information Systems scholars are given the opportunity to fill an important gap in an emerging stream of studies.",

In view of ageing populations worldwide, there is significant interest among the healthcare sector and researchers to improve medication adherence rates for seniors. However, existing studies in the literature focus primarily on identifying the predictors of medication non-adherence. In this paper, we present our work on technology-enabled medication adherence for 24 community-dwelling seniors over a period of more than 2 years. We leverage Internet of Things (IoT) devices to track inferred medication consumption in the seniors' homes, and provide quasi real-time alerts to community caregivers, who can then intervene in a timely manner. Our study suggests that seniors generally do not consume medication on a regular basis (in both the frequency and time domains). However, technology-based approaches that allow for real-time tracking and appropriate interventions by caregivers can be effective in improving the medication adherence of these seniors.",

It combines the concept of neighborhood watch communities with IoT technology in order to develop a Smart Home security community. Therefore, (1) this paper shows a positive influence of community features in the case of non-intrusive devices. Furthermore, (2) it points out the influence of personal relationships on perceived security.

abstract="The increasing availability of low-cost smart devices is bringing them to be used more and more in the smart home. However, the development of a smart home environment requires to take into account several aspects. First of all, designers must consider the end user (namely the person that actually uses the smart home), and not only the technology, at the center of any intervention. Another important aspect is the interaction between the smart home and the appliances that are already deployed in the same smart environment. Moreover, most of smart home solutions are static and do not allow end users to customize them according to their real needs and preferences. Finally, not all end users may possess the necessary knowledge and skills to customize a smart home, but someone else, such as an adult child or a caregiver, may be called on to carry out this task for them. In this paper, we analyze all these aspects that can influence the development and evolution of a smart home. We then propose a model supporting developers and software engineers to deploy and evaluate a smart home solution that adopts end-user development techniques. It is based on the International Classification of Functioning scale, which is used to characterize the person that is mainly going to live in the smart home and define a solution suitable to his/her needs.",

abstract="In times of the demographic change and the increasing need of novel concepts to meet the requirements of older adults' care in the near future, health care robots could be a potent solution to meet shortcomings in the health care sector. Even though the potential of robotic home care assistance is promising, the question if older persons would accept a robotic assistance at home is still underexplored. Adopting a three-step procedure, older adults' perceptions towards home care robots are empirically explored. In a first step, focus groups were accomplished to understand older persons' perceptions on benefits and barriers. Second, a survey study was applied to determine acceptance criteria, the perceived usefulness and the extent and types of concerns toward a domestic robot in homecare. Finally, in a further survey study, specific care situations in the home care settings had to be evaluated in a third study, thereby comparing preferences for a human care persons vs. a robotic care assistant. Outcomes reveal both, age-sensitive as well as age-insensitive findings. While overall a positive attitude towards home care robots was found, serious concerns in terms of fear of loss of control and connection to family members are prevailing. Outcomes contribute to an understanding of social factors in the development and implementation of accepted home care solutions and might be helpful to develop age-sensitive information and communication concepts.",

abstract="The idea of connecting physical things and cyber components to enable new and richer interactions is a key component in any smart space concept. One of the central challenges in these new smart spaces is the access control of data, services and things. In recent years, Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) like Blockchain Technology (BCT), emerged as the most promising solution for decentralized access management. Using capability-based access control, access to data/services/things is achieved by transferring tokens between the accounts of a distributed ledger. Managing how the access tokens are transferred is, of course, a major challenge. Within the IoT space, smart contracts are at the center of most of the proposals for DLT/BCT networks targeting access control. The main problem in using smart contracts as a means for checking if and what access token can be transferred from one account to another is their immutability and accessibility. Smart contracts and chain code are by design meant to be immutable since they represent a binding contract between parties. In addition, they need to be accessible since they are to be executed on many nodes. This allows an attacker to study them and design the attack in a manner that passes the rules of the smart contract/chain code. This paper focuses on the use of metadata as a more effective means to prevent attackers from gaining access to data/services/things in a smart living space.",

These representations should also have the ability to adapt over time to the changing state of the world. That is why we propose IoT-O, a core-domain modular IoT ontology proposing a vocabulary to describe connected devices and their relation with their environment. First, existing IoT ontologies are described and compared to requirements an IoT ontology should be compliant with. Then, after a detailed description of its modules, IoT-O is instantiated in a home automation use case to illustrate how it supports the description of evolving systems.",

In this article, we present a gesture based natural user interface framework, which supports a set of smart home services through gestures. In order to get feedback from the user interaction, a reverse feedback mechanism is implemented, which keeps track of how many gestures are working correctly. We have developed a mathematical model to represent proposed framework. From the user feedback and analysis of the gathered system testing data, we are optimistic about the deployment of the proposed framework in real life scenarios.",

abstract="Power saving is the important issue nowadays, and it is more critical in hostels because of some irresponsible students who leave the room without switching OFF the tubes lights and fans. So, for controlling this wastage of electricity in hostels, we have tried here to develop this system that helps in monitoring and managing the electrical power requirement. In this system, IR sensors sensed the presence of students in the room with the help of counter. When it counts one, it means students enters the room, this counter increases and so on. When the student leaves the room, it decreases the count and when it reaches up to zero, this indicates that no one is present in the room. At this time, after few seconds, the switches will automatically turn OFF, if it is ON, and this information will be sent to the server/cloud where the authorized person can see or watch all the activities in the room. Here, we need only Internet for watching the online process. This will be in the form of notification where it will show the room number, OFF time. The other feature of this system is, when such notifications will be seen on the screen, one SMS will be sent to the student about Rs. 100/- penalty or punishment. Internet of Things plays a vital role in this system. This promotes students to become responsible about careful utilization of electricity.",

abstract="The intent of the paper is to analyse major factors that influence the making of a smart city. In today's global networking scenario where everything is technology driven, the importance of information and communication technology (ICT) cannot be undermined. They offer swift and real-time information and are easily accessible. However, can the cities be labelled as smart just by improvising ICTs or there might be other parameters involved in making a city truly smart? The paper henceforth explores such possibilities of making a city smart by taking case studies of known cities/neighbourhoods who have optimised these standards for success. People's participation in using these technologies and the user experience is one of the important consideration so that they are ready to experience a livable smart and organised city. Smart governance, smart planning, smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment and smart living are also the main highlights of the paper on which the case studies are based to analyse smart cities and provide important basis to emphasise if the proposed 100 smart cites in India can really rise up to the level of smart city parameters and tell a success story.Is it only the ICTs that are responsible for making a city smart or a holistic approach is required?Are we smart enough to embrace a smart city?",

abstract="The smart cities initiative does not consist of filling our cities with tech gadgets, cameras and sensors for the purpose of monitoring and controlling both citizens and urban environment. The smart cities movement is not a marketplace for companies and businesses to sell their ICT products and services to governments. The smart cities objective is not to target the use of urban technology as an end in itself but as a tool towards more citizen-centric cities. Therefore, smart cities are not a big brother watching citizens but an inclusive and participatory arena for local governments and all interested stakeholders (including citizens) to co-create communities that can offer development opportunities to everyone and quality of live, no matter social group, age, or gender. This is the true objective of smart cities, which sometimes gets lost, forgotten or becomes shadowed by an excess of technology. But, how to achieve such a challenging objective? Fortunately, just recently, a definition on smart cities has been agreed by international standardization bodies which, so far, are the ones paving the way regarding concepts, terminology and general understanding of the smart cities movement. This novel definition builds on the sustainability concept, promotes urban development in good harmony with resilience, and uses technology only as a way for cities to measure their smartness and improve their performance. The author, aware of the big step forward that this internationally acknowledged definition is, takes the opportunity that this new piece of formally structured knowledge offers to elaborate a first-of-a-kind framework to conceptualize, model and simulate sustainability, and its practical implementation while promoting urban development and resilience to achieve higher performance levels of urban smartness.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) implementation has spread to various fields, including healthcare. Personal healthcare device such as ECG senses very sensitive voltage from heart and stream the data in high speed to the IoT platform. Data from ECG can be used for many disease diagnoses, including Arrhythmia and sleep disorder. In order to obtain the optimum diagnosis result, IoT platform for healthcare should be able to handle very rapid data stream from users or devices simultaneously and keep the successful connections at a high rate. In this paper, an IoT architecture for healthcare implementing asynchronous processing is proposed. Asynchronous process allows the system to process the data outside the main loop of process. The proposed system measures HTTP successful connections and analytics accuracy. By implementing asynchronous processing, the system can increase the successful HTTP connection up to 50{\%} for 100 users testing scenario compared to the benchmark system. The increase of successful connections improves the analytics accuracy to 98.41{\%}.",

As an emerging novel technical paradigm, cloud computing is becoming an efficient mechanism that has been broadly implemented in multiple fields with using Internet-enabled devices. Telehealth system is one of the crucial domains in applications of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), which is also considered an important component in smart city. However, Personalized Cloud-based Telehealth (PCTH) is still facing a great challenge due to restrictions deriving from various perspectives, such as cloud resource allocations and real-time information transfers. This paper concentrates on the issue of optimizing the performance of the resource allocation for achieving smart tele-health with obtaining and analyzing real-time data within the dynamic application environment in cloud computing. The dynamic data environment is mainly associated with social connections generated by physicians or health organizations. Along with this focus, we propose a novel approach, entitled Smart Cloud-based Telehealth Cyber Physical Social Systems (SCT-CPSS), to enable mobile CPSS to offer users a real-time health information service based on the social networking behaviors and inputs. Main algorithms used in this proposed mechanism include Real-Time Matching with Dynamic Programming Algorithm (RTM-DPA) and Monte Carlo-based Real-Time Analysis Algorithm (MC-RTAA).

abstract="Vocal command may have considerable advantages in terms of usability in the AAL domain. However, efficient audio analysis in smart home environment is a challenging task in large part because of bad speech recognition results in the case of elderly people. Dedicated speech corpora were recorded and employed to adapted generic speech recognizers to this type of population. Evaluation results of a first experiment allowed to draw conclusions about the distress call detection. A second experiments involved participants who played fall scenarios in a realistic smart home, 67 {\%} of the distress calls were detected online. These results show the difficulty of the task and serve as basis to discuss the stakes and the challenges of this promising technology for AAL.",

abstract="The essence of intelligent assistive technologies in smart homes can be outlined as their ability to enhance the user experience in many ways. A way to accomplish this goal is to make such systems aware and knowledgeable about user interactions in the context of the given environment. In the context of smart homes, the ability of such intelligent systems to understand and analyze human behavior in the context of Activities of Daily Living is very essential. Modern day software-based solutions for development of such intelligent systems, should not only be able to sense human movements through Internet of Things based technologies but they should also be able to analyze these components of user interactions in a manner that facilitates optimal utilization of system resources, increases software productivity, improves system interoperability, reduces development and maintenance costs and allows both internal and external reusability of the solutions. Therefore, this paper discusses a study on the `Complex Activity Recognition Algorithm' [1] and proposes a systematic approach to improve this algorithm for better performance and system optimization. The improved version of this algorithm has been tested on several activities and the results obtained uphold the relevance for implementation of the same in different real-time environments.",

To this end, this work applies density based clustering algorithms on gait and trajectory IoT data recorded from real senior homes (``on the wild''). The indoor analytics client analyzes high density regions rendered from locations in real senior homes facilitated by IoT technology consisting of events describing the seniors' position. These are collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client taking into account the available processing resources and configuring itself to deliver the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained by analyzing a whole week's data in two seniors' homes.

This review aims to make contributions to find gaps in the field of information visualization regarding smart home monitoring for older people. Three kinds of information needs of older adults and their informal caregivers regarding smart home monitoring are categorized, including physical needs, emotional needs and cognitive needs. The research studies reflect that these needs are mainly used to discuss ideas of, design approaches for, the information visualization from ten aspects in the visceral level, behavioral level and reflective level. Results show that there is still a big gap existing in enabling older people and their informal caregivers to better understand smart home monitoring information. Some existing design recommendations can be improved while at the same time, some needs have not been manifested through information visualization. A wider understanding of older adults, informal caregivers and home living environment in all aspects are necessary.",

abstract="IoT enabled smart environments typically include large number of simple sensors that are designed to detect specific events. In many environments, however, not one but combinations of sensor events represent activities of interest (such as activities of daily living of a patient in a smarthome). Detecting and monitoring these activities of interest result in both application-specific benefits and operational benefits. However, human activities often overlap, thereby making activity detection from the collected sensor events a challenging problem. In this paper, we first present the various benefits of such materialization of sensor events into activities, and then discuss the challenges in detecting diverse activities taken up by humans. More interestingly, the diversity of human activities and the time-variability of a given activity by the same human, makes reliable detection of activities even harder, and open up interesting avenues for future research.",

abstract="Tracking indoor locations of residents is a prerequisite of accurate monitoring and advanced understanding of human activities in smart homes. Without using any indoor video surveillance devices in terms of preserving privacy and security, majority of existing approaches often utilise wearable BLE/RFID sensor tags to track locations of residents through analysing variations of received signal strength and angle of sensor tags. In a multi-residential environment, these tags can also be used as unique identifiers to help distinguish individuals. However, the extra burdens of remembering and wearing sensor tags all day along restrict them to be widely accepted by senior communities, let alone by people with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we propose a novel indoor tracking technique for smart homes with multiple residents, through relying only on non-wearable, environmentally deployed sensors such as passive infrared motion sensors. We design a multi-tracker system that uses multiple, independent probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes and hidden Markov model, to track different residents' movements separately. We evaluate our tracking technique on real sensor data acquired from a dual-occupancy smart home in our clinical trials. The experiment results, through comparing with location details acquired by wearable tags, demonstrate that our proposed technique is a simple yet feasible solution to tracking multi-residents' indoor movements.",

abstract="With the implementation of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), comes the opportunity to gain valuable insights into an individual's daily habits, patterns and routines. A vital part of the AMI is the smart meter. It enables the monitoring of a consumer's electricity usage with a high degree of accuracy. Each device reports and records a consumer's energy usage readings at regular intervals. This facilitates the identification of emerging abnormal behaviours and trends, which can provide operative monitoring for people living alone with various health conditions. Through profiling, the detection of sudden changes in behaviour is made possible, based on the daily activities a patient is expected to undertake during a 24-h period. As such, this paper presents the development of a system which detects accurately the granular differences in energy usage which are the result of a change in an individual's health state. Such a process provides accurate monitoring for people living with self-limiting conditions and enables an early intervention practice (EIP) when a patient's condition is deteriorating. The results in this paper focus on one particular behavioural trend, the detection of sleep disturbances; which is related to various illnesses, such as depression and Alzheimer's. The results demonstrate that it is possible to detect sleep pattern changes to an accuracy of 95.96 {\%} with 0.943 for sensitivity, 0.975 for specificity and an overall error of 0.040 when using the VPC Neural Network classifier. This type of behavioral detection can be used to provide a partial assessment of a patient's wellbeing.",

Managing of these devices and their resources is a task for the underlying Fog technology that enables building of smart and efficient applications. Currently, the Fog is not implemented to the extent that we can submit application requirements to a Fog provider, select returned resources and deploy an application on them. A widely adopted workaround is to deploy Cloud applications that exploit the functionality of IoT and Fog devices. Although Clouds provide virtually unlimited computation power, they could present a bottleneck and unnecessary communication overhead when a huge number of devices needs to be controlled, read or written to. Therefore, it is reasonable to formulate use cases that will exploit the Edge and Fog functionality and define a set of basic requirements for Fog providers.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming one of hottest research topics. Elderly care is one of important applications in IoT, to grasp the situations around the elder people and then corresponding information can be sent to the care-givers to support the elder people. Abnormal activity detection is a particularly important task in the field, since the services should be immediately provided in such cases. Otherwise the elder people may be in danger. The existing approaches to this problem use some basic living patterns of the elder people, e.g. mobility per day, to detect abnormal activities. However, the detail abnormal activities in various specific situations cannot be detected, e.g., whether there is some abnormal activity when the elder people go to toilet, sleeps or eats something. To solve the above problem, in the paper, we propose a situation-aware abnormality detection system based on SVDD for the elder people. An experiment has been performed focusing on feasibility of the method and accuracy of the system to detect situations and abnormities from real sensors.",

In this sense, FESTIVAL pursues a twofold approach: firstly, the intercontinental federation of testbeds in Japan and Europe using existing tools as well as developing new ones; and secondly, the creation of new services and experiments, to be performed on top of the FESTIVAL testbeds and experimentation facilities, associated to three different smart city domains: smart energy, smart building and smart shopping. Throughout this article the current status of the project (in its first year) is shown, describing the Experimentation as a Service federation approach to be implemented, with a first analysis of the platforms and testbeds that are included within the project. Furthermore, the paper also describes the services and use cases that will be conducted within FESTIVAL lifespan.

abstract="The focus of this paper is to determine whether, and to what extent, a relation exists between a kid-friendly urban space, social inclusiveness, and smart city paradigm. In fact, the practicability for vulnerable city users, such as children, acquires an intrinsic meaning of inclusion and equality, as a necessary condition to be considered and planned in a smart city. Over the years the city is based on the logic of separation and specialization of spaces and functions, so as to further differentiate the different social categories (adults, children, elderly and disabled people). In particular, children play and learn through urban space, developing and consolidating skills and competences. Children use urban space, expressing intents, idiorhythms and, therefore, specific needs. This paper proposes a phenomenological study, developed in the form of a laboratory of Cagliari's explorations, aimed at identifying the spatial, morphological and functional characters and elements of urban materials that determine children's perception and experience of places. The results of this research are a starting point for further studies aimed at integrating, with the parameters identified, the variables already considered in the existing tool for the measurement of the walkability of urban spaces.",

Moreover, the potential of analytics methods for discovering activity recognition in such environment has been investigated. CASE easily allows to implement Smart Home applications exploiting a distributed multi-agent system and the cloud technology. The work is mainly focused on activity recognition albeit CASE architecture permits an easy integration of other kinds of smart home applications such as home automation and energy optimization. The CASE effectiveness is shown through the design of a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of an elder person in its home environment.",

To support healthy and safe living of elderly individuals, a system that can monitor their activities of daily living is needed. This paper proposes a handrail-shaped sensor as a new Internet of Things (IoT)-type sensing system for long-term monitoring of the mobility of elderly people. The handrail-shaped sensor detects changes in mobility using information on movement velocity and the degree of dependence on the handrail. To evaluate the effectiveness of the sensor, we first assessed the accuracy of estimating the position of the load applied to the handrail in our laboratory. We then field-tested the handrail sensor in the home of an 88-year-old woman. The experimental results show that the handrail sensor can estimate the walking speed as well as the grasping position of an elderly person in an actual daily living environment.",

abstract="The elderly population is steadily increasing in most countries due to a decline in birth and mortality rate. The population of independently living senior citizens has also become significant. This has led to an active research focus in geriatric wellness. Apart from the usual physical and cognitive decline that proceeds with age, there are much softer aspects like dignity and ability to live independently (age-in-place). If we monitor the subject all the time by instrumenting them heavily, technology can possibly predict and prevent many abnormal situations. However, this curbs the idea of independent living. Hence, while instrumenting and monitoring is an important paradigm in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), the need for the underlying technology to be non-intrusive or as natural as possible is also pressing. For example, passive infrared (PIR) sensors are quite effective and ubiquitous in detecting presence and movement. In this paper we investigate the opportunities in this sliding balance of intrusiveness versus wellness. We explore ubiquitous and pervasive monitoring to make useful inferences in the subject's activities of daily living (ADL). To this end, we evaluate different type of commercially available sensors such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect{\$}{\$}^{\backslash}mathrm{\{}TM{\}}{\$}{\$}TM, video cameras and smart watches, which will augment the PIR sensors at home. Each sensor will allow the elderly to be monitored for specific wellness parameters. We propose a generic framework with algorithms developed in-house, highlighting the use of the Kinect for computing fall-risk through single limb stand (SLS) and postural stability, smart watches to detect multiple activities in an energy efficient manner using in-built sensors, and, finally, computer-vision based methods using video cameras to detect the liveliness of human beings by computing the micro motions of the body during sleep. These findings can be used for both early risk assessment and cognitive training of an individual. Our framework is also extensible to allow the integration of various sensors and algorithms in addition to being customizable for the context in question. A key challenge in building such a generic wellness care framework to support multiple sensor measurements, is handling the trade-off between cost, intrusiveness, and precision.",

Currently, several integration platforms already exist to integrate technologies in a local gateway (e.g. OpenHAB, Zodianet, etc.). Yet, the local set-up and configuration still is overly complex, especially for non-technical users. In this paper, we present a remote management platform that focuses on ease of configuration and installation. It allows monitoring, configuration, diagnostics and service provisioning without manual intervention of a technical person. The platform reacts on local changes such as the installation of a new device or state changes of discovered services.

We discuss the application of an emerging low-power wide area networking technology, LoRa, which is ideally suited to resource-limited contexts due to its low cost, low power usage, and long range. We describe our experiences in implementing a pilot project carried out in Kikwit, DR Congo to develop a LoRa-based wireless network to track the temperature of blood products, ensuring their security and viability through a decentralised, low-power, and low-cost monitoring system.",

abstract="Electronics such as air-conditioner, TV, humidifier, hi-fi equipment, can be called energy management systems implementing monitoring and statistics of energy data in the building. Their purpose is to make the relationship between power consumption and comfortable and healthy life environment more reasonable. In this paper, we present a novel smart home system integrating many kinds of energy efficiency features. This system is called VCE, which means making healthy life easier. VCE has many distributed low-power sensors in the environment which is used for detecting and better regulating human environment. These data are used for monitoring and analyzing real-time consumed energy on device level. VCE can adjust the temperature, humidity, light intensity volume and other information. And VCE can also detect human real-time vital signs like blood pressure, through sophisticated sensors.",

abstract="The Trigger-Action programming paradigm has been widely adopted in the last few years, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain because it allows end users without programming experience to describe how their applications should react to the many events that can occur in such very dynamic contexts. Several end user development tools exist, in both the research and industrial fields, which aim to support the increasing need to specify such rules. Thus, it becomes important for application developers and domain experts to enrich such environments with functionalities able to monitor how users actually interact with such rule editors, and show useful information to analyse the end user activity. In this paper, we present a visual tool for monitoring and analysing how users interact with a trigger-action rule editor. The goal is to provide a tool useful to better understand what end users' personalization needs are, how they are expressed, how users actually specify rules, and whether users encounter any issues in interacting with the personalization features offered by the editors. The proposed solution supports the analysis through a dashboard and a set of timelines describing the actual use of the personalization tool, with the possibility to select specific events of interest. It moreover provides data useful for understanding the types of triggers, actions and rules actually composed by users, and whether they effectively exploit the personalization features offered.",

The methods applied to reach the educational goals, concerning expert competence within remote diagnostics, have been on site and remote lectures given by engineering, medical and metrology experts. The pedagogical approach utilized has been flipped classroom. The main results show that academic courses developed in cooperation with industry requires flexibility, time and effort from the involved partners. The evaluation interviews indicate that student are satisfied with the courses and pedagogical approach but suggests more reconciliation meetings for course development. Labs early in the course was considered good, and division of labs at the system and the component level. However further long-term studies of evaluation of impact is necessary.",

abstract="The SUMMIT project funded by the Italian MISE under the PON2020 Action, aims to the development a IoT (Internet of Things) platform which should be flexible and adaptive to easily embed several smart objects such as sensors, multi-sensor architectures and mobile terminals. The main idea is to lunch an open and dynamic eco-system to support the development of IoT based services both for the private and public sectors. The concept of ``pattern'' will lead the overall development of the SUMMIT platform which represents each element to be integrated in the SUMMIT framework by assuring security, privacy and dependability properties. Above patterns will be also self-evolving on the basis of their behavioral analysis to be performed during the system operation. The three main cases of study addressed by the project will be smart energy, smart health and smart cities. Among patterns addressed by the project the development of a smart inertial platform is considered. Such platform will find application in several contexts with a strong priority in the Smart Living framework. As an example, the architecture developed can be adopted for the sake of Activity of Daily Living monitoring (including Falls), postural instability detection, aided navigation, physical activity assessment, just to cite mostly addressed needs. Actually, above application contexts represent serious needs to be addressed to enable Active Ageing and Well Being. The Smart Inertial Pattern (SIP) is based on an embedded architecture equipped with sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass) and communication facilities. In this paper the use of the SIP device for the implementation of a ADL classifier exploiting an event correlated approach is presented.",

abstract="With the increased success of Internet of Things (IoT), the conventional centralized cloud computing is encountering severe challenges (e.g., high latency, non-adaptive machine type of communication), that proved insufficient to meet the stringent requirements of IoT applications. Besides requiring fast response time, increased security and privacy, they lack computational resources at the edge of the network. Motivated to solve these challenges, new technologies are driving a trend that distributes the computational resources and shifts the function of centralized cloud computing to the edge. Several edge computing technologies, edge and fog paradigms, originating from different backgrounds have been emerging to overweight these challenges. However, to fully utilize these limited devices, we need advanced resource management techniques. In this paper, we present a novel distributed resource allocation algorithm with the purpose of enabling seamless integration and deployment of different applications in an IoT infrastructure. The algorithm decides: (i) the mapping of an IoT application at the edge of the network; (ii) dynamic migration of parts of the application, such that Service Level Agreement (SLA) is satisfied. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss our approach and the potential to minimize the latency of different IoT applications.",

abstract="The paper deals with the intergeneration municipality project on the development of computer literacy in the elderly people with focus on the management of conducted courses. The aim of the paper is to design and propose a model of the project management. The sub-goal is to identify which computer skills attendees of computer literacy courses have and which computer skills they would like to gain or develop. The next issue is to find whether pupils that give lectures to the elderly people have necessary computer skills. The main purpose of the research is to gain current data needed for the updating phase of the long-term project. Key data and findings are collected from own questionnaire investigation and interviews with the municipality, directors of elementary schools, teachers, pupils and attendees which were conducted during computer courses for elderly people. Results and recommendations will be used for the next run of courses that are organized twice a year by municipality in cooperation with primary schools. The biggest ratio of participants can use the Internet followed by email and Skype. MS Excel and Instagram represent the smallest ratio of applications that pupils can use. All other followed applications are used by more than 85{\%}. Results are important for the project team so that they could monitor and evaluate the progress of the project and work out its updated phase.",

abstract="In this research we examine the generation specific acceptance motives of eHealth technologies in order to assess the likelihood of success for these new technologies. 280 participants (14 - 92 years of age) volunteered to participate in a survey, in which using motives and barriers toward smart home technologies were explored. The scenario envisaged was the use of a medical stent implemented into the body, which monitors automatically the health status and which is able to remotely communicate with the doctor. Participants were asked to evaluate the pros and cons of the usage of this technology, their acceptance motives and potential utilization barriers. In order to understand the complex nature of acceptance, personal variables (age, technical expertise, health status), individual's cognitive concepts toward ageing as well as perceived usefulness were related. Outcomes show that trust, believe in the reliability of technology, privacy and security as well as intimacy facets are essential for acceptance and should be considered in order to proactively design a successful rollout of smart home technologies.",

The ecosystem of the manufacturing industry is expected to be activated through autonomous and intelligent systems such as self-organization, self-monitoring and self-healing. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is beginning with an attempt to combine the myriad elements of the industrial system with Internet communication technology to form a future smart factory. The related technologies derived from these attempts are creating new value. However, the existing Internet has no effective way to solve the problem of cyber security and data information protection against new technology of future industry. In a future industrial environment where a large number of IoT devices will be supplied and used, if the security problem is not resolved, it is hard to come to a true industrial revolution.

abstract="The last two decades show that population is continuously and gradually aging; in Italy, the percentage of over-sixties has increased since 1980 by more than 50 {\%} while the over-eighties by more than 150 {\%}. Aging causes a consequent psycho-physical decline which in many cases requires specific care and precautions by relatives. However, as can be easily inferable from the percentage of elderly just shown, today the national health-care systems are not able to manage and take charge of all these elders. More and more seniors are choosing to live alone, with all the problems related to emergencies and urgencies cases that can occur due to poor health status related to aging (falls, cardiovascular events, neurological events). In this case, providing health-care initiates to have its new challenges. One of the worst possible case of emergency in elderly living alone is bad injury within the home without the possibility for seeking a help. This paper presents a work related to this issue; project SMARTA, focused on biomedical and environmental monitoring for the active aging. The project is based on the use of biomedical sensors and sensorized garments for health status and cardio-monitoring, and accelerometers fixed on the floor for activity and fall detection. All this sensors are integrated in a system that is used for monitoring elderly both indoor and outdoor during their daily life thanks also to the connection over the Internet.",

abstract="The ability to efficiently predict the elderly's future situations and make the right decision accordingly is a necessity in developing smart homes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and dynamic predictive model which utilizes higher order Markov models integrated with a situation ranking technique. More specifically, we employ a revised version of PageRank algorithm to take the properties of the situation-graph (structure and semantics) into account and dynamically rank the situations considering the user's mental state. Then we apply rankings as prior probabilities in order to build the corresponding Markov model. Also, we utilize rankings to identify milestone situations and transitions in order to compress the representation model. Experiments show that the predictions obtained by this approach are more efficient and effective than the ones produced from the pure predictive graphical model-based approaches.",

In this paper, the PLC-utilized remote power metering and monitoring and control of power usages of respective power supplies have been implemented for the system. In addition, In-home headcount monitoring algorithm is proposed in an attempt to achieve efficient power usage management. It is expected that the proposed foundation technology will eventually become a foundation technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). We also anticipate that the technology could be useful for the establishment of an adequate power saving scheme with continuous power usage monitoring and will provide better user-convenience by controlling the power remotely and efficiently. Furthermore, since it provides relatively easy addition or removal of devices within the household, the system will have wider scalability.",

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) enabled in a smart home requires, the design of an activity recognition system. Generally, supervised machine learning strategies or knowledge engineering strategies are employed in the process of activity modeling. Supervised machine learning approaches incur overheads in annotating the dataset, while the knowledge modeling approaches incur overhead by being dependent on the domain expert for occupant specific knowledge. The proposed approach on the other hand, employs an unsupervised machine learning strategy to readily extract knowledge from unlabelled data and subsequently represents it as ontology activity model. The novelty in the proposed design is in the usage of Contextual Pattern Clustering (CPC) for activity modeling. The competence of the weighted Jaro Winkler similarity measure introduced in CPC lies in the utilization of contextual attributes for the composition of varied event patterns of an activity. Hierarchical strategy employed in CPC offers structured knowledge on activities and sub activities within a specific location. Additionally, the event organizer and habitual event generator subsystem introduced in the proposed framework derives knowledge related to event ordering and contextual description of an activity. The attained knowledge is later represented as a probabilistic ontology activity model to enable probabilistic reasoning over domain knowledge. An experimental analysis with a smart home dataset demonstrates the proficiency of the proposed unsupervised approach in activity modeling and recognition in comparison with that of the existing modeling strategies.",

abstract="The smart fridge has often been considered a prototypical example of applications of the Internet of Things for the home. However, very little research has been conducted on functions desired by prospective users, and how users will eventually use the fridge. A simulation of a smart fridge was developed and tested within a controlled laboratory between-subjects experiment with 105 participants. Four different assistance functions were tested. It was found that generally a smart fridge is evaluated as moderately useful, easy to use and people would tend to buy it, if it was already available. Emotional responses differed between the assistance functions. Displaying information on durability of products, as well as giving feedback on nutrition health and economics are the most appreciated applications. Structurally, overall usefulness ratings of the device are the strongest predictors for the intention to use a smart fridge, but the emotional response to the product was also an important explanatory variable. Results are not influenced by technical competence, gender, or sense of presence in the simulation. Regression models confirmed that the simulation-based results explained 20{\%} more variance in product acceptance than written scenarios. An outlook is given on future questions to be answered using the simulation.",

abstract="Facing the healthcare challenges of an aging society, the expansion of AAL system implementation in private and public environments is a promising way to improve healthcare in future smart homes and cities. The present study evaluated preferences for different video-based medical monitoring scenarios, which comprised the attributes medical safety (improved detection of medical emergencies), privacy (handling of video information), type and location of camera in a conjoint analysis. Medical safety was identified as key driver for preferences. Acceptance for video-based medical monitoring systems in public places was comparably high, given that privacy was protected. In contrast, acceptance for video-based monitoring in smart home environments was rather low due to privacy concerns. Based on the findings, recommendation for AAL system design and implementation were derived.",

abstract="The phenomenon of ageing population is raising substantial pressure to the national health and welfare systems of many countries in the world, and can be a potential threat to social stability and economic development. IoT wearable medical technologies have the potential to aid this struggle, but anecdotal evidence showed that large-scale deployment of IoT wearable devices among the ageing population could be fraught with challenges, which have not been well reported in academic literature. Therefore, this paper aims to address this knowledge gap by reporting on an exploratory study that firstly investigated older people's user requirements towards wearable medical devices and secondly explored potential challenges and difficulties for large-scale deployment of such devices. Five focus groups were conducted to collect insights and opinions respectively from five families (i.e. each contained 1--2 elderly members, accompanied with 2--4 family members who held caring responsibilities). The data collected was analyzed by using a thematic analysis approach. The results showed that elderly people have complicated and diverse user requirements towards IoT wearable medical devices, and that a range of challenges related to hardware providers, caregivers, legal regulations and technical features can affect large-scale deployment of such devices. The paper concluded that these identified user requirements and challenges should be carefully considered by wearable hardware designers, system developers, and service providers if they want their innovative products and services to be accepted and deployed among the ageing population globally.",

The RADIO project explores a novel approach to user acceptance and unobtrusiveness: an integrated smart home/assistant robot system where health monitoring equipment is an obvious and accepted part of the user's daily life. By using the smart home/assistant robot as sensing equipment for health monitoring, we mask the functionality of the sensors rather than the sensors themselves. In this manner, sensors do not need to be discrete and cumbersome to install; they do however need to be perceived as a natural component of the smart home/assistant robot functionalities.",

One of the problems of interest is this of monitoring the activities of daily living (ADLs) of the elderly aiming at their protection and well-being. In this work, we present our initial efforts to automatically recognize ADLs using multimodal input from audio-visual sensors. For this purpose, and as part of Integrated Project Netcarity, far-field microphones and cameras have been installed inside an apartment and used to collect a corpus of ADLs, acted by multiple subjects. The resulting data streams are processed to generate perception-based acoustic features, as well as human location coordinates that are employed as visual features. The extracted features are then presented to Gaussian mixture models for their classification into a set of predefined ADLs. Our experimental results show that both acoustic and visual features are useful in ADL classification, but performance of the latter deteriorates when subject tracking becomes inaccurate. Furthermore, joint audio-visual classification by simple concatenative feature fusion significantly outperforms both unimodal classifiers.",

This study was intended to examine trends and outlook of smart care by type of elderly and situation to spur improvement in health management for the elderly. Smart cares by type of elderly and situation were elderly-friendly smart home, smart care for management of chronic diseases in the elderly, and smart care for the elderly living alone. Smart care is needed to be implemented actively not only to reduce medical costs and improve the quality of medical services but also to ensure safety and quality of life for the elderly. However, multi-faceted efforts need to be made to help overcome the difficulties arising from degraded cognitive function of the elderly, considering the basic orientation of smart care such as mobile, smart, cloud computing, IoT, etc. For that, it would be necessary to develop elderly-friendly devices suited for characteristics of the elderly group and to actively deploy professional manpower, in parallel with active support from related organizations, who can provide instant support to the elderly encountering difficulty with the use, so as to stimulate the smart care service in the period ahead. Furthermore, as health information and privacy information generated in connection with individuals are sensitive data, it would be the most important to ensure that strict security is maintained for safe data transmission and that only necessary part of information is shared selectively.",

abstract="To address the projected global shortfall of gerontological health care workers, we outline a research approach that is informed by the past successes of public health toward the goal of developing and implementing smart homes at the community-level to support independent living. Specifically, we discuss the epidemiologic triad consisting of host, environment, and agent factors in relation to other person-environment fit models. We propose this model as the underlying framework for a smart homes development approach that focuses on creating task advantages to support independence at home. We provide recommendations to implement the approach by including community-level stakeholders and policy makers in research that uses a model well-recognized by public health professionals.",

abstract="Smart home is a home that has a set of electrical appliances connected to a network can be remotely controlled, accessed and monitored. Smart home normally is used to fine-tune human's daily life. However, the main problem is when different devices such as sensors and electrical appliances produced by different manufacturers being used in a smart home. Each device produced by different manufacturer might come with their own set of communication protocol. Therefore, it is important to have a standardized communication protocol for interconnecting and remotely controlling those devices to ensure data can be transmitted to each other. This project aims to present the Smart Home using MEMS Sensor and Ambient Intelligence (SAHOMASI) where in this paper, a standardized communication protocol is proposed to overcome the above problem. The features of the system includes monitoring elderly's activities, detect fall and sending email to caregiver upon abnormal activity or fall detected.",

abstract="This paper proposes using a commodity-based smartwatch paired with a smartphone for developing a fall detection IoT application which is non-invasive and privacy preserving. The majority of current fall detection applications require specially designed hardware and software which make them expensive and inaccessible to the general public. We demonstrated that by collecting accelerometer data from a smartwatch and processing those data in a paired smartphone, it is possible to reliability detect (93.8{\%} accuracy) whether a person has encountered a fall in real-time. By wearing a smartwatch as a piece of jewelry, the well-being of a person can be monitored in real-time at anytime and anywhere as contrasted to being confined in a particular facility installed with special sensors and cameras. Using simulated fall data acquired from volunteers, we trained a fall detection model off-line that can be composed with a data collection accessor to continuously analyze accelerometer data gathered from a smartwatch to detect minor or serious fall at anytime and anywhere. The accessor-based architecture allows easy composition of the fall-detection IoT application tailored to heterogeneity of devices and variation of user's need.",

While in smart cities the focus is on efficiency, whether it is on city governance, energy consumption, waste management, communication or transport, in playable cities the focus is on making cities more attractive for its inhabitants and visitors by introducing entertaining, playful and humorous interactive installations in the urban environment. In this paper we look at existing playable city projects, look at their characteristics and see whether their `playability' can be experienced by others than those who are qualified as the `smart people' that are usually seen as the `users' of these playful installations. We mention some criticisms on these projects and also compare the playable cities initiatives with initiatives that aim at making cities more child-friendly.",

abstract="Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a very active topic of research that is gaining more and more attention because of its characteristics, transparency and intelligence. Older people is one of the collectives that can take advantage of the use of AmI systems because, thanks to these characteristics, AmI systems can focus on older adults' real needs so that they satisfy one of their main motivations to adapt technological innovations: perceived benefits.And, perhaps, everything related to healthcare and home care is perceived by them as both valuable and beneficial. In this paper, it is presented the Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) of a healthcare AmI system to treat older people' motor impairment problems by using specific devices to control the patient's movements. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is being widely exploited. AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. One of the main differences of our system is that it provides therapist with support to design new therapies, to adapt them to each specific person and to control their execution instead of using a fixed set of exercises.",

abstract="In the course of demographic change, an increasing proportion of older people in need of care pose enormous burdens for the care sectors of today's society, which could dramatically aggravate in the next decades. Developing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies is one approach to support older people and people in need of care to live as long as possible independently at their own home. Besides technical opportunities and functions, future users' acceptance is decisive for the success and long-term usage of innovative technologies. Thus, for AAL technologies it has to be explored which factors are crucial for acceptance and to what extent those factors differ with regard to diverse user groups. Referring to existing technology acceptance models (in particular the UTAUT2-model), it is questionable whether such models can be adapted and are appropriately usable for the context of AAL technologies. In this paper, we therefore investigate potential users' attitudes towards AAL systems as well as the importance and relationships of technology-related and user-specific characteristics in a scenario-based online questionnaire study using an adapted and extended version of the UTAUT2-model. The undertaken adaption led to a better understanding of influencing factors for AAL acceptance: privacy concerns need to be addressed as an additional predictor. Regarding user factors, age, Attitude Towards Technology (ATT), and caregiving experience were revealed as influencing factors, whereas gender and health status did not show any effects on AAL acceptance.",

abstract="Thermal Comfort Control for indoor environment is an important issue in smart city since it is benefit to people's health and helps to maximize their working productivity and provide a livable environment. In this paper, we present an IOT (Internet of Things) based personal thermal comfort model with automatic regulation. This model employs some environment sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, etc., to continuously obtain the general environmental measurements. Specially, video cameras are also integrated into the IOT network of sensors to capture the individual's activity and dressing condition, which are important factors affecting one's thermal sensation. The individual's condition image can be mapped into different metabolic rates and different clothing insulations by machine learning classification algorithm. Then, all the captured or converted data are fed into a PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model to learn the individual's thermal comfort level. In the prediction stage, we introduce the cuckoo search algorithm to solve the air temperature and air velocity with the learnt thermal comfort level, which is convergent rapidly. Our experiments demonstrate that the metabolic rates and clothing insulation have great effect on personal thermal comfort, and our model with video capture helps to obtain the variant values regularly, thus maintains the individual's thermal comfort balance in spite of the variation of activity or clothing.",

abstract="As people live longer, the increasing average age of the population places additional strains on our health and social services. There are widely recognised benefits to both the individual and society from supporting people to live independently for longer in their own homes. However, falls in particular have been found to be a leading cause of the elderly moving into care, and yet surprisingly preventative approaches are not in place; fall detection and rehabilitation are too late. In this paper we present FITsense, which is building a Smart Home environment to identify increased risk of falls for residents, and so allow timely interventions before falls occurs. An ambient sensor network, installed in the Smart Home, identifies low level events taking place which is analysed to generate a resident's profile of activities of daily living (ADLs). These ADL profiles are compared to both the resident's typical profile and to known ``risky'' profiles to allow evidence-driven intervention recommendations. Human activity recognition to identify ADLs from sensor data is a key challenge. Here we compare a windowing-based and a sequence-based event representation on four existing datasets. We find that windowing works well, giving consistent performance but may lack sufficient granularity for more complex multi-part activities.",

Consequently, they are connected to data networks to share this information and find elements that allow them to make the appropriate decisions. Then, for practical usage, their computational capabilities should be optimized to avoid issues such as: resources saturation (mainly memory and battery). In this line, machine learning offers a wide range of techniques and tools to incorporate ``intelligence'' into embedded systems, enabling them to make decisions by themselves. This paper reviews different data storage techniques along with machine learning algorithms for embedded systems. Its main focus is on techniques and applications (with special interest in Internet of Things) reported in literature about data analysis criteria to make decisions.",

abstract="The ``implementation'' and use of smart home technology to lengthen independent living of non-instutionalized elderly have not always been flawless. The purpose of this study is to show that problems with smart home technology can be partially ascribed to differences in perception of the stakeholders involved. The perceptual worlds of caregivers, care receivers, and designers vary due to differences in background and experiences. To decrease the perceptual differences between the stakeholders, we propose an analysis of the expected and experienced effects of smart home technology for each group. For designers the effects will involve effective goals, caregivers are mainly interested in effects on workload and quality of care, while care receivers are influenced by usability effects. Making each stakeholder aware of the experienced and expected effects of the other stakeholders may broaden their perspectives and may lead to more successful implementations of smart home technology, and technology in general.",

Many Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods are data-driven, where the quality of collected data can significantly affect the accuracy of results. However, data collection for FDD of buildings is a challenging task as needed data is not typically readily available. In this paper we focus on the data collection for FDD of smart buildings.

However, one is usually interested in the phenomena observed by one or more devices and not in the sensors themselves. To bridge this gap, we introduce and evaluate the concept of Service-Level Semantic Entities (SLSE). They support the automatic semantic annotation of real-world objects based on networked sensor devices. SLSE continuously collect observations of sensors attached to some objects, and aggregates them to descriptions of the objects themselves. It then makes this augmented object data available as (semantic) linked data. This removes several layers of indirection in the semantic data, and allows to directly access properties of real-world objects.",

abstract="The number of information technology users increases as fast as new information technology develops. This paper aims to analyse Internet users older than 65 years and focusing on the Czech Republic, the Visegrad group (also referred to as V4) and the European Union. Elderly people use the Internet the least from all age groups. The partial aim of this paper is to analyse whether, since 2009, there has been a constant increase in Internet users in the elderly age group in the Czech Republic and also the EU. The second scientific issue deals with the confirmation that the number of Internet users in the 65+ age group is similar to the EU-28 and V4. The analysis showed that the number of 65+ users has been steadily increasing since 2009. In the Czech Republic only 28.4{\%} elderly people used internet in 2015 and 26.7{\%} in 2014. According to Eurostat methodology the Internet is used in the 65--74 years age group by 33{\%} of users. More than one third (38{\%}) of elderly aged 65--74 used the internet at least once a week in the EU-28.",

abstract="Modern technologies support people's life in multiple contexts like the assistive one. The pervasiveness of the so-called ``Smart Objects'', related to the Internet of Things technologies, is boosting this in many ways. The support for old people to take the daily tablets through an automatic device is an example. This work presents the prototype of a modular pill dispenser customized by end users according to their specific therapy needs. The prototype is a physical and modular set of pillboxes each containing the pills to be assumed in a therapy. The presented scenario at a specific time, set by the user, one or more pillboxes blink to alert the patient that is pill time. If for a given time interval the patient do not take the pill a sound notification is activated and plays for a given duration. If still nothing happens then a notification is sent to the caregiver's smartphone. The behavior of the pill dispenser is defined by the end user and can be modified any time. One peculiarity of the pill dispenser is that the number of physical boxes are decided by the user and can change any time to best fit the specific therapy. The final goal of this work is to push not professional users, in particular older people, to take advantages of new technologies to improve their life.",

abstract="In the context of twenty-first century, diabetes is one of the most lethal diseases from which millions of people of different age levels are suffering. It is imperative for a diabetes patient to maintain the blood glucose level all times as there is no stable solution for this disease. However, the infants and the elderly, suffering from diabetes might not have the notion of maintaining the level of sugar in their blood. So, constant monitoring of the patient has become the most feasible `solution'. But the traditional method for measuring blood glucose level is not a viable option for constant blood glucose monitoring. Even if this invasive method is more accurate, it is painful and also there is a risk of infection, although minimal. That is why the non-invasive method seems to be a reasonable option for the ongoing monitoring of blood glucose. For constant remote collection and monitoring of the data obtained from the diabetes patient, an IoT-based non-invasive monitoring system has been proposed in this research that can be a great aid, besides the invasive method for constant monitoring purposes.",

Since 2015, the Dutch government encourages their citizens to age-in-place, but at the same time struggles with how to implement new healthcare regulations. To support both government and citizens, we propose a digital platform to match supply and demand in the health and wellbeing domain. Such a platform should not only enable end-users to enhance self-management, but also support them to find solutions for everyday problems related to aging-in-place.

abstract="The growing number of older people emerges the need to consider autonomy concerns for those people and their need for intensive care. Plenty of researches, such as those in the domain of Ambient Assisted Living Systems, have been carried out to create enhanced conditions for older people and people with disabilities, based on providing ICT solutions that enhance the well-being of elderly people and provide them with well independent daily living. This paper discusses how the efficiency for AAL solutions is achieved, through the identification and introduction of different essential requirements that should be realized to meet the objectives of ALL systems towards their various users, including family members and caregivers. Set of systems has been introduced with their solutions and architectures, to reach the main goal of this work, by evaluating these systems based on the proposed requirements, whether they meet the requirements, by studying system functionalities.",

abstract="New technologies offer an opportunity to improve the wellbeing and independence of older adults, but many of the potential benefits, have not yet been realised. Some technologies suggest a lifestyle of constant monitoring, controlling and nudging - transformations that could be perceived as threatening. To better understand older adult perceptions and attitudes to adoption of such systems, we describe a 3 week field trial of an application and view the results through the lens of protection motivation theory. Our participants identified a number of threats including not being able to live independently, fear of getting lost, being stigmatised and lack of privacy. Usability, accessibility, reliability, costs and usefulness all negatively impacted coping appraisal that would result in non-adoption, despite their stated intention to adopt the technology in the future.",

abstract="Smart Cities with their mobility system are assumed to be based on smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration, assigning citizens significant roles. While some argue that ICT will enhance democratic debate and empower citizens, others concern about the development of Smart Cities ``without critical discussions and politics''. Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched its Smart City project in 2010, setting specific criteria to ensure the ``participation of all the stakeholders''; however, drawing on analysis of official documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart Communities' stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of these experiments would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services.",

A questionnaire was verbally administered in face-to-face sessions by trained interviewers in order to collect data. Overall, the results return a positive picture of participants' perception of the technology though attitude towards technology is definitely driven by utilitaristic means: usefulness, easiness, safety and privacy are considered important while aesthetics, size and weight are not. Around half of our respondents have a positive interest in technology and almost all of them believe that technology may eventually improve their life. According to these findings, the paper discusses some challenges for the whole research sector that appears still fragmentary and lacking of a strong body of evidence.

abstract="Activity recognition is an important step towards automatically measuring the functional health of individuals in smart home settings. Since the inherent nature of human activities is characterized by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty, it poses a great challenge to build a robust activity recognition model. This study aims to exploit deep learning techniques to learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminant latent patterns inherent in the low-level features. Specifically, we first adopt a stacked autoencoder to extract high-level features, and then integrate feature extraction and classifier training into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. We use three benchmark datasets to evaluate our method, and investigate two different original sensor data representations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition rate and generalizes better across different original feature representations compared with other four competing methods.",

This is a major health risk, especially among the elderly; thus, the early detection of fall motion is of great significance. A smart home care system is needed to monitor abnormal events. This paper first conducts a survey of existing smart systems and techniques in detecting fall motion in human movement, including the emergence of new natural user interface (NUI) devices and systems in the consumer market. Secondly, the paper categorizes smart technologies for fall motion detection into three main technological groups: acoustic and ambient sensor-based, kinematic sensor-based, and lastly the computer vision and NUI. An insightful discussion of each category's advantages and disadvantages is provided. The findings show a promising research direction of integrating the computer vision with the novel consumer-grade NUI device, such as Kinect, in achieving of an affordable and practical smart home fall motion detection system.",

Childhood obesity and malnutrition are one of the major healthcare problems regarding children. Such a crisis can cause several diseases and death in the long run. We have strongly felt the need for an infallible system to safeguard our children users. To establish our idea, we proposed a framework by implementing the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT), where a child's mental and physical health state can be tracked and necessary steps can be taken with the help of parents and health tutors. In our system, we set up a communication medium among children, health tutors, and parents. Various features like activity tracking, geolocation, and fitness programs are installed within the system.

Most older adults prefer to age in place in their home environment. Assistive ICT can support older adults in staying independent, connected, and healthy and provide help in emergency situations. However, older adults represent a special group regarding the use of ICT: they are still often less experienced and cautious in adapting new technologies. Correspondingly, acceptance poses the greatest barrier for the success of assistive ICT. Older adults are not a homogeneous group, they differ in their experience with technologies, attitudes towards aging, and ideas for quality of life. In a questionnaire approach, N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}166 participants' attitudes towards aging and evaluation of two examples of ICT are assessed. The analysis shows, that technology generations differ in their opinions about aging as well as their assessment of assistive ICT.

Such systems must collect and analyze data in the home to recognize unusual activities and alert care givers and/or family members in emergency situations. To address this challenge we developed a flexible and scalable multi-agent system for sensor data collection, integration, processing, and alert management. A prototype system for activity recognition has been built and preliminary tests demonstrate that activities can be successfully recognized based on data captured in the home. As a next step, the sensor network will be deployed in an inpatient residence facility to collect real-world data for evaluating the system's performance and to develop new applications.",

abstract="The ultimate goal of smart things and systems should be to improve Quality of Life (QoL), specially of elderly given that population is increasing rapidly. A number of smart ageing solutions are developed without QoL of elderly being noticeably improved. This paper seeks to answer the question are the existing smart ageing solutions succeeding in direct improvement of QoL of elderly. After conducting a survey study for this purpose, the results showed that existing solutions are not succeeding in improving QoL of elderly. In addition to this conclusion, the contribution of this paper reflects in proposed set of QoL indicators for elderly and recommendations for future research activities in this area.",

abstract="Currently, there is a rising number of elderly people worldwide. By 2020 the percentage of elderly people aged 60+ years should reach 30 {\%} out of the total number of population living in the developed European countries This aging process, however, results in new economic and social issues Therefore there is constant effort to prolong and maintain the active age of these elderly people, who want to lead active, fulfilling and quality life in terms of inclusion, socialization and independence. This can be achieved not only by a continuous support from their family members, but also with the help of modern information and communication technologies (ICT), which can assist elderly people in this process. The purpose of this article is to explore benefits and limitations of using ICT, particularly the smart ones, by the elderly people. In addition, the author of this study emphasizes the importance of appropriate training about the benefits of smart technologies.",

abstract="Australia's increasing aged population is associated with rises in health expenditure and residential care costs, creating a public health challenge. This challenge can be met with in-home monitoring systems that allow older people to live at home longer. There is, however, a dearth of knowledge on how Australians feel about being monitored. Here we describe an ongoing study conducted with elderly residents as part of a smart home pilot. We aim to identify perceptions of the sensor-based in-home monitoring system throughout the pilot, from conception to completion. In this paper, we provide our preliminary findings of initial reactions to the technology and contributions made by prospective residents at pre-pilot workshops. We found participants favoured system flexibility and enhanced family communication and that undesirable aspects could be circumvented or solved by our researchers. Much of the participant feedback was incorporated into the design of the pilot and the associated technologies.",

Our target is to analyze the users' habits at home through an extensive survey performed in France recently, and to design a suitable assistive system, which is mainly composed of devices available in the market. This research activity led to the deployment of a simplified hardware infrastructure (gateway, sensors, actuators) in the home of end-users with a limited number of wireless sensors, and to the outsourcing of all the software for data analysis in a framework running on a distant server. The research focuses on the quality of life of ageing people having cognitive and functional limitations, and on recent achievements realised in France and Singapore through several European and national projects, and through Quality of Life Chair (QoL) directed by Mounir Mokhtari and supported by two major health insurance companies in France, namely la Mutuelle Generale and REUNICA.",

abstract="To support an aging population there has been a move towards developing surveillance technologies that observe the movements, behaviours and health status of older people. These technologies are meant to support health and independence within the context of limited resources. Although there have been studies about the development of new devices and systems, there has been less research examining the impact of surveillance technologies that monitor those residing and working in care facilities. This paper reports the findings from a qualitative study of a residential care facility that instituted video surveillance. The findings revealed how surveillance was used as a care management tool -- to provide access to real-time data, to preserve the safety of older people and to monitor the working practices of formal carers. However, there may also be some unintended consequences of the implementation of video surveillance in residential care.",

Lisbon Strategy [1] and ``Leipzig Charter [2] on Sustainable European Cities'' both recognize that cities are ``centers of knowledge and sources of growth and innovation''. Developing intelligent and innovative solutions, using responsible and sustainable resources, many cities are implementing strategies for transforming themselves into a ``knowledge city'', but the results still have little significance, particularly because it is necessary to identify and manage the intangible assets, recognized as intellectual capital. This paper proposes an approach to audit this knowledge using the same concept of intellectual capital that is applied to companies.

The idea of robot personas is introduced, and based on our empirical observations, it is argued that the robot persona, rather than the physical embodiment, is the most important determinant of the degree of users' acceptance in terms of users' perceived trustability and responsiveness of the robot and therefore their sense of enhanced usability and satisfaction with such personal assistive systems.",

Smart Shelve is equipped with external optical sensors for food recognition, while inside it is composed of several food compartments in which load cells measure the weight of each type of food. The system is capable to warn the users who have recently conducted an incorrect style. The system is also able to send the acquired food consumption information to the cloud in order to provide statistical services regarding the nutrition style of clusters of users localized in a specific geographical area (e.g. district or region).",

Our hypothesis is that the addition of a structural representation and transitional features will improve performance for the corresponding prediction tasks of different networks. We apply our graphical feature-based approach on smart phone GPS sensor data to predict activities performed by phone users. We represent the location category corresponding to each GPS value as a node and movement of users from one GPS location to another as an edge in graph. Then we extract graphical features such as existence of nodes and edges from the graph representation and add them to basic sensor data features coming from the smart phone. We find that using this augmented feature set improves activity recognition accuracy by 7.27{\%} compared to using only basic non-graphical features with feature set augmented with existence of nodes performing the best.",

Technological navigation aids for blind must provide accurate information about the environment and select the best path to reach a chosen destination. Urban barriers represent dangers for the blind users. The dynamism of smart cities promotes a constant change of these dangers and therefore a potentially ``dangerous territory'' for these users. Previous work demonstrated that redundant solutions in smart environments complemented by human computation could provide a reliable and trustful data source for a new generation of blind navigation systems. We propose and discuss a modular architecture, which interacts with environmental sensors to gather information and process the acquired data with advanced algorithms empowered by human computation. The gathered metadata should enable the creation of ``happy maps'' that are delivered to blind users through a previously developed navigation system.",

abstract="Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are very useful for fully automatic extraction of discriminative features from raw sensor data. This is an important problem in activity recognition, which is of enormous interest in ambient sensor environments due to its universality on various applications. Activity recognition in smart homes uses large amounts of time-series sensor data to infer daily living activities and to extract effective features from those activities, which is a challenging task. In this paper we demonstrate the use of the CNN and a comparison of results, which has been performed with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), recurrent neural networks and other machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models, Hidden Semi-Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields. The experimental results on publicly available smart home datasets demonstrate that the performance of 1D-CNN is similar to LSTM and better than the other probabilistic models.",

By using smart automatic controlling system, we can save some amount of power. In this paper, we are preventing the consumption of energy in an adequate and cost-effective manner. We proposed a system for automatic control of appliances as well as power reduction module. When the user enters into the room, the light and fan will turn ON automatically, and while the user exits, it will turn OFF automatically using PIR sensor. Based on the presence of the user, the power reduction module switches the appliances in the span. It also controls the speed of fan based on room temperature with LM-35 sensor. By using ACS712 Current Sense Module, we control the current flow. And also we can control the appliances through mobile when the user is not at home. All the data can be stored in cloud for future reference.",

abstract="Existing assistive living solutions have traditionally adopted a bottom-up approach involving sensor based monitoring, data analysis to activity recognition and assistance provisioning. This approach, however, suffers from applicability and scalability issues associated with sensor density and variations in performing user activities. In an effort to alleviate these challenges, the current study proposes a goal oriented top-down approach to assistive living which offers a paradigm shift from a sensor centric view to a goal oriented view. The basic concept of the approach is that if a user's goal can be identified, then assistance can be provided proactively through pre-defined or dynamically constructed activity related instructions. The paper first introduces the system architecture for the proposed approach. It then describes an ontological goal model to serve as the basis for such an approach. The utility of the approach is illustrated in a use scenario focused on assisting a user with their activities of daily living.",

abstract="Ageing-in-place, the ability to age holistically in the community, is increasingly gaining recognition as a solution to address resource limitations in the elderly care sector. Effective elderly care models require a personalised and all-encompassing approach to caregiving. In this regard, sensor technologies have gained attention as an effective means to monitor the wellbeing of elderly living alone. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of non-intrusive sensor systems to detect socially isolated community dwelling elderly. Using a mixed method approach, our results showed that sensor-derived features such as going-out behavior, daytime napping and time spent in the living room are associated with different social isolation dimensions. The average time spent outside home is associated with the social loneliness level, social network score and the overall social isolation level of the elderly and the time spent in the living room is positively associated with the emotional loneliness level. Further, elderly who perceived themselves as socially lonely tend to take more naps during the day time. The findings of this study provide implications on how a non-intrusive sensor-based monitoring system comprising of motion-sensors and a door contact sensor can be utilized to detect elderly who are at risk of social isolation.",

abstract="Against the background of demographic change, today's society is getting increasingly older. In order to handle growing care needs and shortages of skilled workers, ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies provide prevention and rehabilitation measures which facilitate aging in place and relieve caregivers. In this context, ultrasonic whistles could represent an innovative assistance system for home automation, safety prevention, positioning, and motion analysis. However, the acceptance of AAL-technologies is challenging due to perceived restrictions, e.g., on privacy and autonomy, and depends on individual attitudes, demands, and concerns. As health impairments and care dependency increase with age, research focus is set on age-related user factors. We examined user-specific concepts of aging in relation to the assessment of ultrasonic whistles in home care. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews and a scenario-based ground plan interaction were conducted. Results indicate that particularly positive or negative associations with aging affect AAL-acceptance, strongly related to issues of quality of life, active aging, social integration, dealing with change, health, and care dependency. Regarding trade-offs between perceived benefits and barriers, users with positive concepts of aging consider AAL as relief to maintain autonomy, ensure safety prevention, and facilitate everyday life whereas users with negative concepts of aging express concerns about dependency on technology, loss of control, restrictions on privacy, and data security. The findings contribute to an understanding of -aging concepts and their relation to care assistance that can be used for age-specific communication concepts.",

To tackle this problem, this work proposes the use of an improved version of the Elman Neural Network (Elman-NN). In order to minimize the error between inputs and desired outputs, we optimize some criteria of the network to gain good results. We propose to use the Differential Evolution algorithm in the learning step of the Elman-NN to evolve the error performance. Our proposed model is responsible to predict the activities of the monitored elderly and to detect any state changes. This hybridization will help to optimize the weight and the bias of the network to achieve our objective function and to obtain a good network. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model is satisfactory for elderly person's movement prediction.",

abstract="Nowadays, we live in environments where smart products enable new processes of human and non-human interaction. Smart concepts push functions beyond traditional levels of expectation. It is widely appraised that smart concepts enhance products to make them respond to human needs and expectations. However, regardless of the level of complexity and intelligence of those products (regardless of scale, from home environment to an object), if the environment is non-user-friendly, users will reject them and eventually abandon them. Conceptualizing intelligent solutions is more often centered on the requirements of functions and overlooks the profile of users, a critical aspect to outline the experience. Present-day interaction between users and smart products should be enabled by their physical model, finishing, interface features and functional capabilities. The quality of experience is not only grounded on the type and efficiency of the task performed. The quality of the experience depends on: the physical experience (dimension, height, shape, finishing); the sensorial experience (how does the artifact stimulate the sensorial human system); the cognitive experience (how easy it is to interact with technology) and the emotional experience (is this a pleasant experience? Would we repeat it?) Moreover, outlining the users' demands and expectations from environments, products and technology is also critical to reach qualified and appealing solutions. The aim of this paper is to establish the need of taking a different approach when conceptualizing smart environments and products, arguing that users can only understand inherent intelligence if the parameters that sponsor an emotional appealing experience are considered throughout the design process.",

Also the Internet of Things (IoT) is a networking technology by using the smart objects and attracts high attention. Furthermore, a smart home which consists of these technologies is expected to be spread widely. In the smart home, it is important to get the information of location/position accurately in order to provide services based on the information of person or object. One of the most popular methods for estimating the position of person or object, the Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) method is used for many systems. RSSI method uses a behavior that strength of a signal from beacon node is inversely proportional to distance. However, the location of the wireless nodes which receive a signal has to fix and be discovered in advance. Therefore if the nodes are moved from an original position, the person or object cannot be detected accurately. Accordingly, we propose a method that estimating the positions of moved nodes and updating the position information by adding node for the RSSI positioning method. Currently, we have performed preliminary implementation of the system. In the future we will finish the implementation of the methods designed in the paper and evaluate the methods in details.",

However, as many of the elders choose solitary life alone and because of the isolation, the emergency service model has faced two main challenges: first, how to discover the fall accident; and next, how to communicate the emergency service center. In this research, we propose an intelligent homecare emergency service system based on two intelligent technologies: artificial neural network and intelligent software agent. The fall detector that based on tri-axes accelerometer and back-propagation neural network classifier is implemented to detect the fall events automatically. On the other hand, an intelligent agent-based homecare emergency service system is developed to communicate the emergency service center and hospitals for requesting help. In the meantime, the basic and important health information related to the elder will be sent together with that request. Thus, the emergency service center can base on the elder's information to dispatch an available ambulance that takes the necessary medicines and equipment to the elder's house.",

abstract="In this paper, we synthesize research on the different emerging Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) sensor-based technologies and examine the spatial parameters that are used in these systems. Different lenses in examining the AAL literature are considered, such as the chronological development in sensor-based AAL and the human factors in the design of sensor-based AAL in various contexts. Relevant metrics and standards in AAL design are highlighted. A comparative prospective of these metrics and how they are applied in recent studies and systems are also discussed. The paper presents a categorization of those technologies based on their selection of the spatial information to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationship between spatial modeling and the accuracy of these technologies. Implications for the design of AAL and situated interaction in AAL contexts are discussed.",

abstract="This is a picture of the Panopticon. I live in a world now, where everybody can observe me without me knowing when I am being observed and when not. So, that's the threat model I'm primarily aiming at. Last year I was working for a large software company. They had an insurance company as their client. They were trying to get data on people out of the on-board diagnostics. Not only the speed, et cetera, to do pay-as-you-drive insurance, but also the location information from the on-board diagnostics. This is similar to the government U-turn on health privacy that we heard about from Ross. And most of the times, the software that lies in my car (or in my toaster) I do not own or control. It's owned by the company who manufactured it. Like, the Jeeps that John Deere manufactures, they say that the software is owned by them. The user has no access, no control, nothing to do with it. But forensics is a important concern. If my car (or my toaster) happens to kill me, then the investigator should be able to find out exactly what happened when I was murdered.",

abstract="The EU funded project inCASA has brought new insights in the field of socio-medical technology using the context-aware LinkSmart middleware. One of the main concerns that were experienced was whether separate medical devices could aggregate contextual information given by multiple environmental sensors within social care. Energy profiles were hypothesised to be able to substitute many of these in exchange for context information about a patient's behaviour. A small study was conducted to review the energy profiles given by medical devices at dispose. Unluckily, the results showed that the medical devices do not expose relevant information in order to construct such profiles.",

The development of the smart home concept allows people with a severe disability to control their home devices using a customised user-interface. Beyond this, the creation of a central system controlling a wide range of daily equipment, unlocks opportunities for the creation of many value-added services or new Usage. In this article, we will present our analysis of the ``usage'' definition. We will also describe our approach in identifying new technology usages. Although our smart home concept development has followed a user-centred approach throughout the project, taking a step back to analyse its usage has allowed us to expand its potential application scope, and develop an extended investigation of user's needs.",

abstract="The population of older adults is increasing across the globe; this growth is predicted to continue into the future. Most older adults prefer to live in their own home, but many live alone without immediate support. Living longer is often coupled with health and social problems and difficulty managing daily activities. Therefore, some level of care is required, but this is costly. Technological solutions may help to mitigate these problems by recognising subtle changes early and intervening before problems become unmanageable. Understanding a person's usual behaviour when carrying out Activities of Daily Living (ADL) makes it possible to detect and respond to anomalies. However, current commercial and research monitoring systems do not offer an analysis of ADL and are unable to detect subtle changes. To address this gap, we propose the STRETCH (Socio-Technical Resilience for Enhancing Targeted Community Healthcare) sensor platform that is comprised of non-invasive sensors and machine learning techniques to recognise changes and allow early interventions. The paper discusses design principles, modalities, system architecture, and sensor network architecture.",

abstract="The elderly population is increasing and the need of smart home technology and customized health-care solutions is growing rapidly. A common symptom of old age is cognitive impairment, which can in some cases lead to the inability of self-navigation. Numerous indoor navigation systems have proposed to solve such problems. However, previous developers have only to a minor extent included elderly in the design process, despite the user group's complex needs. The solution presented in this paper is based on using recognizable aids and abstractions to ensure that the new proposed system is something elderly users can relate to and feel comfortable with. Other solutions often require wearable modules, or constant interaction, whereas this system does not require any of the two. In addition to our solution we present five implications when designing an indoor navigation system for elderly people.",

abstract="To face the challenges of increasing care needs due to demographic change, the development of smart home and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies present one approach, which is continuously forwarded. Besides aspects of technical development and implementation, user acceptance of diverse stakeholders plays a major role for a successful rollout and sustainable adoption of those technologies. So far, user acceptance research in this context has concentrated mostly on age-related issues. In contrast, disabilities and related care needs have hardly been researched yet. The current study focused on persons having different experiences with disabilities and care needs. In a qualitative interview pre-study (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}9) and a follow-up quantitative online questionnaire study (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}279) perceived benefits and barriers, use conditions, and acceptance of AAL technologies were contrasted. Four user groups were under study: disabled participants, relatives of disabled persons, professional caregivers, and, as a control group, persons without experience with disabilities. Results indicate that disabled and care-needy people show a higher acceptance and intention to use an AAL system than not-experienced people and especially professional caregivers. The motives for acceptance and rejection differ strongly regarding user diversity as well. The results contribute to a better understanding of user-specific acceptance of smart home and AAL technologies and show that the integration of diverse user groups into the technologies' design and evaluation process is necessary.",

The interest and biomedical research in the modern society is intensively directed on disease prevention, early diagnostic and life quality improvement as well as on development of personalized healthcare especially for those chronically ill, disabled and for the aging population. The aim of the new approach in healthcare is not only to monitor and improve health of individuals, but also to increase their independence, mobility, safety and social contact through increased communication, inclusion and participation using available technologies. A large number of new medical devices for health monitoring, home care, wellness promotion, gerontotechnology, etc. have to be designed, tested and adopted to meet the special needs and demands of different population groups. These new devices for telemonitoring and telediagnostics create large amount of health related information, in most cases from sensors organized into body sensor networks. The information has to be processed, transmitted from the point of care to the healthcare system in a safe way and after managing the information in an appropriate and intelligent manner, decisions related to the persons health are to be made.

One strategy to meet these challenges is an increased focus on self-care via use of broader social networks and seamless integration of applications with lifestyle activities, particularly for people with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. There has also been a rapid increase in a range of technologies for connecting different components of the health system and delivering services through smartphones and connected devices.

This paper presents the findings from a ten week training course were participants were trained in the use of Facebook and EasiSocial, a newly introduced web application which displays Facebook in a manner which is more suitable for older people. An evaluation study was undertaken of both applications in an effort to gain insight into the reasons why older people (50--80 years old) do not use social media.

In this empirical study, we explore users' perceptions on safety and privacy in the context of surveillance systems. In order to understand if the acceptance of surveillance depends on usage contexts, surveillance technologies in the urban were compared to the medical context. Using an online survey, 119 users were requested to indicate their acceptance regarding different types of surveillance contexts and technologies, differentiating perceived benefits and barriers as well as safety and privacy needs. We investigate acceptance differences towards surveillance technologies at various locations (private and public) as well. In this paper, we especially explore the impact of different surveillance contexts, locations and individual perceived crime threat on the acceptance of surveillance technologies and on the needs for privacy and safety.",

The paper brings an insight into the technical literature review. It strives to summarize key beneficial outcomes and contrary unexpected obstacles which elderly people face when they use information and communication technology. A set of examples as practical demonstrations of real computer usage by elderly people illustrates the issue on the national scene. The research was run to explore the computer literacy in elderly people from three perspectives, roughly corresponding to three kinds of elderly people reflecting their physical and mental state. Findings from the surveys which were conducted with a group of elderly respondents in the senior homes and findings from the interview with a young lector teaching old generation show the issue in the local city environment. A question on benefits of organized course for the elderly from the questionnaire explores the survey from four perspectives and brings enriching findings. Findings from literature review correspond to findings gained from the research. Positive attributes of active utilization of the Internet contribute to active ageing, to the combat of the feelings of social isolation and loneliness.",

We hope to eventually integrate CALONIS fully into the next generation of the Tampa VA SmartHome in which the SmartHome itself becomes a fully interactive and intelligent electronic caregiver. The project began with a Wizard-of-Oz version of CALONIS but even at this early stage we appear to have achieved high levels of patient engagement as well as in relation to the caregiver.

The majority of elderly people find the control of such systems laborious. This highlights the need for usable designs that take into consideration the cognitive limitations of this category of people. This paper contributes towards this problem through the introduction of a novel vehicular Remote Exploration Surveillance Robot (RESBot), capable of monitoring in real time the environment in response to events. The interaction with the system is achieved through natural language commands and hence, provides improved usability over traditional approaches. Results from the experimental usability evaluation of the RESBot system revealed considerable improvement over conventional home security systems.",

abstract="As part of a PhD thesisat the Loria research center, National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine (INPL), ``Maisons Vill'{\^A}ge®'' a new concept of building smart home by integrating telehealthcare and home automation systems, is developed in France. The segment of population, we are targeting is the senior citizens. The healthcare system uses home automation sensors and other environmental sensors like bed and chair sensors to monitor the activity level of the elderly. Activity patterns are analyzed by an intelligent application which is based on Fuzzy Logic to find any unusual behavior. The system is also equipped with wireless medical sensors to monitor the health situation of the elderly; it uses also a wireless sensor network to detect falls. The system detects health abnormalities at an early stage through the frequent monitoring of physiological data. This paper presents a brief description of the system.",

abstract="In the near future, our homes will be equipped with many sensors, actuators and devices able to smartly interact in order to offer complex services providing even richer functionalities. Among the general population, those most likely to benefit from the development of these systems are the elderly and dependent people who wish to continue living independently in their home as opposed to being forced to live in a hospital. However, today's systems are mainly based on ad hoc and proprietary solutions. To cope with the ad-hoc nature of smart home systems design process while taking into account both dimensions of time and space, it is required to use a suitable formal model that is able to handle smart home domain specific nature. This paper proposes an approach that uses reference nets to model a smart home which is sensitive, adaptive and responsive to elderly's presence, needs and preferences.",

To ground our design, we used design thinking as a guideline process. We evaluated the prototype using qualitative analysis of interview data. The findings show that the prototype motivated people grouping food and increased their awareness of the availability of food items in the fridge, the prototype also encouraged people in using food before expiration date.

The proposed scheme can utilize only a positioning sensor attached to a resident with/without power meters attached to appliances of a smart environment. We target 10 different living activities which cover most of our daily lives at a smart environment and construct activity recognition models.

Reflective assistance is concerned with the construction of flexible `smart' systems that control the eldercare environment, adapting the ambient to the needs of individuals. New technology transforms a living space to a helpful residence assistant that observes inhabitants and offers aid or calls for it in the case of need.

The first is an in-home sensor system for detecting early signs of health changes and managing chronic health conditions. The second is an interactive remote physical therapy system that connects a therapist in the clinic with an older adult in the home. An overview of each application is presented.

abstract="In many societies, the age profile of the population is increasing, posing many challenges for societies, health services and carers. One response to this unfolding situation has been to direct research effort towards Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), specifically, its enabling technologies. A critical impediment to the deployment of such systems remains the accurate and timely identification of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). This paper advocates a minimalist approach to ADL recognition; rather than capturing all possible ADLs, the reliable identification of a select subset of ADLs may prove sufficient for many categories of AAL services. A methodology is described and initial results presented.",

abstract="Ambient-assisted living (AAL) is an initiative to extend the time the elderly can live in their home environment by increasing their autonomy and assisting them carry out their daily activities. AAL systems exploit information and communication technologies (ICT) in the assistance to carry out daily activities, health and activity monitoring, enhancing safety and security and getting access to social, medical and emergency systems. These ICTs are in the form of smart systems, which are physical objects that are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, enabling them not only to intercommunicate with one another, but also to exchange information with people and react to their environment. This paper is on a low-cost technology customised to the South African environment to support ambient assisted living. The technology takes advantage of South Africa's digitalisation programme to provide broadband access in the support of AAL. Digital television as a gateway to internet access, wireless mesh networks for communication, motes for machine to machine communication and smart phones are the technologies supported in this architecture. A survey of AAL technologies was conducted and features of these systems that would be useful in defining our architecture identified. These features contribute to the development of an architecture for AAL. This research feeds into extending the body of knowledge on AAL technologies.",

abstract="In today's ageing societies, the proportion of elderly people living alone in their own homes is dramatically increasing. Smart homes provide the appropriate environment for keeping them independent and, therefore, enhancing their quality of life. One of the most important requirements of these systems is that they have to provide a pervasive environment without disrupting elderly people's daily activities. The present paper introduces a CBR agent used within a commercial Smart Home system, designed for detecting domestic accidents that may lead to serious complications if the elderly resident is not attended quickly. The approach is based on cases composed of event sequences. Each event sequence represents the different locations visited by the resident during his/her daily activities. Using this approach, the system can decide whether the current sequence represent an unsafe scenario or not. It does so by comparing the current sequence with previously stored sequences. Several experiments have been conducted with different CBR agent configurations in order to test this approach. Results from these experiments show that the proposed approach is able to detect unsafe scenarios.",

Sensors and actuators must be embedded in textiles in a way that they could be used as a user interface. The design of these textiles should meet human needs and should enable an intuitive, easy to learn, and effective interaction. To meet these requirements, potential users should be part of the development and evaluation processes of innovative smart textiles.

abstract="The omnipresence and familiarity of textiles in combination with the integration of invisible sensors, actuators, and information and communication technology under the term ``interactive digital textiles'' offer the potential of bridging the gap between age, the aging-population, and latest information and communication technology. Digital textiles are reaching maturity and first technology augmented cloths are becoming commercially available. However, little is known about the acceptance and projected use of digital textiles for/in home environments and whether acceptance is shaped by age, gender, expertise in interacting with technology, or other aspects of user diversity. In a survey with {\$}{\$}n=136{\$}{\$}participants, we identified and quantified factors that influence the adoption and rejection of a smart cushion as example for digital textiles. We found that attitude towards technology and attitude towards automation are decisive for the projected acceptance, while age plays a minor role. In addition, we provide a customer segmentation based on the projected use and provide detailed descriptions of adopters and rejecters as well as their model-based evaluations of the smart interactive cushion. The article concludes with open research questions and strategies for practitioners to leverage smart textile interfaces as basis for many innovative products in the future.",

abstract="In the last decades, datasets have emerged as an essential component in the process of generating automated Activity Recognition (AR) solutions. Nevertheless, some challenges still remain: the lack of recommendations about which kind of information should be represented inside a dataset has resulted in the implementation of a variety of different non-standardized formalisms. On the other hand, this information is usually not sufficient to fully characterize the dataset. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a series of recommendations in the form of a dataset model with a well-defined semantic definition, for supporting those who are responsible for the creation, documentation and management of datasets. In addition, in order to better characterize datasets from a statistical point-of-view, we describe eight statistical analyses which should be included as additional measures within the dataset itself. We have validated our concepts through retrospectively analyzing a well-known dataset.",

abstract="Given the large amount of sensed data by IoT devices and various wireless sensor networks, traditional data services lack the necessary resources to store and process that data, as well as to disseminate high-quality data to a variety of potential consumers. In this paper, we propose a framework for Data as a Service (DaaS) provisioning, which relies on deploying DaaS services on the cloud and using a DaaS agency to mediate between data consumers and DaaS services using a publish/subscribe model. Furthermore, we describe a decision algorithm for the selection of appropriate DaaS services that can fulfill consumers' requests for high-quality data. One of the benefits of the proposed approach is the elasticity of the cloud resources used by DaaS services. Moreover, the selection algorithm allows ranking DaaS services by matching their quality-of-data (QoD) offers against the QoD needs of the data consumer.",

SHLAS is Multi-agent based. Each agent has three levels: the Goal Layer has business rules for representing agent goals; the Strategy Layer provides technical rules and processes for guiding how the agent reacts to events; the Component Layer is made up of components, some components are called by technical rules and processes in the Strategy Layer, some others are used for communicating with third party systems. This agent framework enables the customizability of agents in SHLAS. We also introduce an Ontology-based domain knowledge and context model to capture and represent the agents, and agent behavior which provides agents with reasoning ability. SHLAS helps users with healthy lifestyle promotion by tracking and analyzing their behaviors, and recommending health plans. The paper closes with an empirical evaluation of the approach from the point of view of customizability.",

The ontology will be our foundation for user modeling of patients in the telehealth domain, and hence it is one of the initial steps toward our vision. Compared to other ontologies within the domain, ours has explicit focus on: 1) personality traits of the patient, which is vital for fulfillment of our vision in term of adaptability, and 2) use of international standards to describe diseases, functioning and physiological measurement -- ICD, ICF and SNOMED respectively -- to promote interoperability with external systems. Besides being the foundation for user modeling, the ontology is a component in the Patient@home infrastructure, where it will ease the integration of applications to the platform, and facilitate semantic interoperability between the applications.",

The proliferation of Smart TVs as central information hubs in elderly assisted living environments, along with the need for simple gesture control schemes for these demographics, provides one application of this framework.

abstract="Security, privacy and dependability are crucial issues if one wants to build a real smart home. First, in addition to established home security requirements, smart home adoption requires to solve brand-new security vulnerabilities deriving from the automated facets of smart homes. Thereafter, pervasive computing and ambient intelligence allow to collect a lot of information, to analyze it to derive new facts, and make them explicit. Finally, systems that are usually safe and dependable can fail when their behavior is becoming controlled as the result of complex interactions between many intertwined information systems. Unfortunately, application developers in smart home environments are usually neither security experts, nor familiar with ethical and legal requirements related to privacy. Security patterns can help to anticipate, overcome, and document systematically these difficult issues in building pervasive information systems in smart homes for cognitively impaired people. In this paper, we illustrate how security patterns can be extended and applied to Smart Home to foster autonomy of elderly or cognitively impaired people, then, we sketch the structure of the catalog which will be populated with a few patterns.",

abstract="Older people would like to live independently in their home as long as possible. They want to reduce the risk of domestic accidents because of polypharmacy, physical weakness and other mental illnesses, which could increase the risks of domestic accidents (i.e. a fall). Changes in the behaviour of healthy older people could be correlated with cognitive disorders; consequently, early intervention could delay the deterioration of the disease. Over the last few years, activity recognition systems have been developed to support the management of senior citizens' daily life. In this context, this paper aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art presenting a proof of concept where information on body movement, vital signs and user's indoor locations are aggregated to improve the activity recognition task. The presented system has been tested in a realistic environment with three users in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed method. These results encouraged the use of this approach in activity recognition applications; indeed, the overall accuracy values, amongst others, are satisfactory increased (+2.67{\%} DT, +7.39{\%} SVM, +147.37{\%} NN).",

abstract="Health management is fundamental to enabling elderly people to `age in place' in their homes, and health care services can help elderly people to manage their health. The number of elderly people who require such care services is increasing rapidly, causing a parallel rise in the need for expert care providers. One of the solutions to this demand for expert care is an automatic health care system that may be integrated into a residence, but installing and operating such systems can be prohibitively expensive. To solve this issue, a cost-effective activity monitoring based health care system is proposed in this study. The system uses the infrastructure of a smart grid and a home network system in order to reduce the costs of installation and operation.",

Age related diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), require close monitoring and assessment. A home-based assessment tool, which collects information on people's hand and finger movements, has been developed. It is intended that movement difficulties such as bradykinesia and rigidity can be identified through the use of this tool. Remote monitoring of this home based tool has the potential to decrease the number of clinic/hospital visits a person with PD requires. Two groups of 10 people took part in an evaluation of this system. One group were persons with PD and the other were without PD.

abstract="Welfare technology (WT) is often developed with a technical perspective, and little consideration is taken regarding the involvement of important ethical considerations and different values that come up during the development and implementation of WT. Safety, security and privacy are significant, as well as the usability and overall benefit of the tool, but to date assessments often lack a holistic picture of the WT as seen by the users. This paper suggests a user-centered ethical assessment (UCEA) framework for WT to be able to evaluate ethical consequences as a part of the user-centered aspects. Building on established methodologies from research on ethical considerations, as well as the research domain of human-computer interaction, this assessment framework joins knowledge of ethical consequences with aspects affecting the ``digitalization with the individual in the center'', e.g. privacy, safety, well-being, dignity, empowerment and usability. The framework was applied during development of an interface for providing symptom information to Parkinson patients. The results showed that the UCEA framework directs the attention to values emphasized by the patients. Thus, functionality of the system was evaluated in the light of values and expected results of the patients, thereby facilitating follow-up of a user-centered assessment. The framework may be further developed and tested, but in this study it served as a working tool for assessing ethical consequences of WT as a part of user-centered aspects.",

In this work, we propose PROtEUS: an integrated system for process execution in cyber-physical systems. PROtEUS is able to bridge the gap between hardware-related processes and human-centered workflows.

Successful development of this emerging technology will promote the ability for older people to live independently and age in place. This paper focuses on the socio-technical challenges associated with implementing the AAL market with specific reference to Canada. The strategy used to gather information was a case study design. Market facilitators include the vast Canadian geography, the number of older people living in rural communities, and the development of several provincial initiatives aimed at enabling seniors to remain independent. The principle of universality in Canada's healthcare system bodes well for these technologies, as AAL has the potential to assist in equalizing services to these communities. Barriers include fragmentation of the market, where in Canada more than 100 different health authorities serve individuals across ten provinces and three territories.",

These concerns are related to concrete living issues, like being notified of a ringing phone for a deaf people, or receiving adequate assistance after a fall. The framework explicitly models three aspects: agent's goals, formally capturing users' concerns; abstract solutions, defining a canvas for answering the goal; and concrete solutions in terms of APIs or various combination of APIs, for their operationalisation. We illustrate the usage of our framework on two simple scenarios.",

Research has shown that lighting in various colors and intensities can be used to improve people's moods, e.g. through its effects on melatonin levels. This is especially interesting in the context of ambient assisted living and care environments where people are less mobile and spend long hours indoors. The presented work aims at creating a technical system that can detect an older resident's mood and consequently adapt the lighting in the room to either calm or activate the person. As part of the system's design process we conducted interviews with caregivers in different care settings (day care, stationary care and home care) to gather requirements for the system. The study provides insights into moods of seniors and their detection, which is formulated in a preliminary mood model, as well as design considerations for different living- and care-settings.",

The approach permits both bottom up and top down methods of reasoning about data. The tradeoffs between granularity of ground truth acquisition and its impact on the detection rate are presented. It is suggested that the acquisition of ground truth should become a seamless operation incorporated transparently into the workflow of operations in these facilities. It is expected that with automation of collection, the increasing corpus of ground truth will lead to steady improvements in the detection rate and therefore the quality of automated monitoring and care provisioning. The methodology and models are substantiated with real data from two assisted living facilities, one in Singapore and the other in France.

As such there is a great demand for technologies that support the independent and safe living of the elderly and ensuring that they are not socially isolated. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have thus emerged to support the elderly people in their daily activities, while removing the need of caregivers being always physically present in order to look after the elderly. The current AAL systems are intelligent enough to take critical decisions in emergency situations like a fall, fire or a cardiac arrest, hence the elderly can live safely and independently. In this abstract, we describe our solution that aims at integrating all relevant functionalities of an AAL system, based on feedback collected from representative users. This work is carried out in the European Union project called CAMI (Artificially intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL).",

abstract="Home telecare systems aim to support effective communications and emergency calls for people living in dependency situation but hardly provide reasoning capabilities to understand what to do in a problematic situation. This paper details the design and implementation of a reasoning platform to foresee or react in a smart way at home situations demanding care support for citizens from informal or remote carers. The system manages intelligent agents, whose behavior is defined and validated by ontologies and rules, to react in the elderly fall episode. A development methodology was adapted to sustain knowledge acquisition process from experts and to create the ontology for reasoning logic at homecare scenario. Thus, the platform is easily customizable to acquire data from telecare sensor networks, make reasoning according to each user profile and trigger ad hoc actions to communicate the problematic situation, to whom corresponds, or to interact with home appliances and residential gateways.",

A large number of studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle has become a global public health problem, which has a negative impact on human life. Unhealthy sitting posture can lead to many diseases. When people sitting for a long time, the unbalanced force may lead to some diseases such as sitting sores and lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spine injury etc. Therefore, it is necessary to study the pressure distribution in the sitting position. Smart seat and mobile application designed for sedentary people is an effective tool for the prevention of these diseases, the pressure center of the body posture can be detected and analyzed, in order to guide people to the correct posture, help prevent disease due to unbalanced posture.",

In this paper, we present the preliminary efforts in designing a pediatric rehabilitation protocol based on Smart Objects and biofeedback, which we administered to a small sample of hemiplegic children. Despite the few treatments (not suitable to assess any change in the subjects' abilities), children enjoyed participating in the study, and the initial qualitative/quantitative results highlight that such approach could represent an interesting starting point to fuel the scientific and clinical discussion towards a Pediatric Rehabilitation 2.0.",

abstract="There is now a vigorous body of opinion that has recognised both the major demographic transitions that have taken, and continue to take, place in most countries in the world, and the ways in which the design of both products and the built environment can either aggravate or ameliorate the impact of some of the disabling conditions that come with ageing (Clarkson et al, 2003). Furthermore, there is recognition of the fundamental importance of research with older users, and of understanding the interaction between individual and environment or ``technology'' in its broadest sense. This chapter reports on a component of a multi-disciplinary research project that was concerned with the introduction and use of a wide range of AT* in existing (older) housing occupied by older people. The main aims of the research were, in conjunction with ten housing partners, to investigate the feasibility and cost of introducing AT in relation, on the one hand, to user needs and, on the other, to the age, type and standard of property. However, the extent to which AT can narrow the gap between the home environment and individual capacity, depends upon the willingness of older people to use AT. If AT is to be introduced on any significant scale to support care in the community of older people, it must be easy and effective to use, and be positively welcomed by older people themselves. A key element in the research was therefore to explore with older people their use and experience of a range of AT.",

The research proposes a direction for the development of smart homes in Korea, especially, for single households with a focus on their home workspace.

abstract="Nowadays, more and more exhibition centers and store owners are deploying beacon devices to implement location-based services. However, the beacon technology can only provide one-way communication. If we need the smartphones to respond to the beacon messages, the smartphone users have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. In some cases the mobile Internet services may not be always available. Therefore, we develop an interactive positioning and tracking system based solely on the BLE technology. Specifically, we make the beacon devices capable of two-way communication. On one hand, our beacon devices can detect the presence of a specific customer at specific locations, and then the presence information can be sent to the application server via the BLE mesh network consisting of beacon devices. On the other hand, the application server can send a personalized location-based message to the customer, again via the relay of beacon devices. The benefit of our system is two-fold: not only the customers without Internet connections can enjoy the positioning services, but also the backend system can be aware of the presence of specific customers and track their real-time locations. Experimental results showed that our system is practicable with moderate transmission latencies in the BLE mesh network.",

abstract="An increasing number of scholars have been recently exploring the role of factors that foster the adoption of different types of assistive technologies among older adults. Our study contributes to this field with a mixed-methods intervention study that combines a baseline and follow-up telephone survey with semi-structured interviews to evaluate the user experience and potentially identifies additional acceptance factors of e-care systems and relations among them. Different assistive technologies were tested and evaluated by three groups of participants: (1) older adults testing mobile and wearable devices and (2) informal carers who remotely monitored events recorded by e-care systems installed in the homes of (3) care receivers. The findings indicate heterogeneous needs and expectations these three groups have towards the use of e-care systems. Moreover, the results also unveil the fear of not getting help quickly in case of an emergency, and perception of safety and peace of mind as important predictors of the use of e-care systems among informal carers and care receivers. Indirectly, the results also reveal the importance of intervention and mixed methods design studies as a means of a more comprehensive understanding of acceptance factors of assistive technologies.",

abstract="In current Smart Home implementations pressure sensors within the environment are normally deployed in a uniform pattern. Nevertheless, in order to create an optimised pressure sensor deployment paradigm it is necessary to correlate the positions of sensors with the high frequency movement behaviours of the inhabitant. The locations of furniture and other objects in the environment should also be taken into consideration. To create a paradigm for optimised sensor deployment, data pertaining to inhabitant movement behaviour first needs to be collected. This paper outlines the evaluation of two movement behaviour capture methods and assesses them for practical issues such as ease of installation and feasibility of use.",

abstract="In the transformation from traditional to smart cities, there is an increasing trend around the world towards intelligent dynamic infrastructures that provide citizens with new services that can improve their quality of life and fulfill the criteria of energy efficiency and sustainability. In the light of this, an important challenge is how to enable citizens and cities to promote the sensing of data with regard to a number of different factors. This paper outlines the early stages of our research which is concerned with an ubiquitous service-oriented architecture for urban sensing called UrboSenti. The proposed approach differs from other sensing plat-forms since it provides a set of services to collect data from several sources and assists in the development of new sensing applications. In addition, our model encompasses all the sensing activities, ranging from the collection of data to the generation of reports about events in the city.",

In this context, the present paper proposes a new home automation system able to support people with the early-stage dementia in kitchen management. This system is managed through an adaptive interface, which guides the user in kitchen activities, provides information on the functioning of all devices in the kitchen specifically, allows to set and control all household appliances in a simple and intuitive way and gives information, adapting to the end-user's capabilities and needs. Although this preliminary evaluation only included a small number of participants, the results showed that the introduction of a new smart home system can be useful to individuals suffering early-stage dementia to facilitate independent living and remain longer in their own homes.",

abstract="The Internet of Things, smart devices, connected health and ICT have the potential to enable people, carers and families to improve the quality of health and social wellbeing. One factor that can help people with physical or cognitive impairments to learn new skills and to be connected with the world, concerns accessible interaction with media devices, such as radios, TVs, tablets and smartphones. According to input received from stakeholders of Irish-based communities of people with different abilities, one of the main barriers for users relates to a reduced level of accessibility when controlling media devices. The aim of this work is to improve users' autonomy by providing tools that enhance users' abilities with media device functionalities through the use of configurable prototypes of media assistive controllers. The output of the work is a proof of concept version of a methodology that matches user ability profiles to configurations of the corresponding functionalities of media assistive devices according to the Universal Design approach. This framework enables people with different abilities to independently engage with a media controller, through a multi-level interaction approach. It also facilitates users who become proficient at using a device at one level to improve their capabilities to a more complex level, requiring additional users' interaction. Finally, it provides an example of how the ICF can be leveraged to suggest accessibility configuration parameters for devices of this type.",

The work seeks to balance the needs and desires of an individual with those of other people within the locality, community, and world, to include basic comforts like temperature and humidity of a living environment as well as use of resources like power and water. The use of mobile technologies---already prominent among many populations---can be used to raise awareness of the needs and responsibilities of the individual and can highlight opportunities to live in ways that are friendlier to others. Mobile technologies have great promise in connecting users to their environment, and a smart environment enhanced with technology that supports better living can improve the lives of individuals, groups, and the broader community. The goals of this work are toward encouraging: 1) increased awareness of information in the user's surroundings; 2) integrated control over factors in one's surrounding and home environments; and 3) increased ability to support sustainable living for both individuals and groups. This work builds on the many smart, green, and sustainable living environment initiatives that have emerged in recent years.",

To meet the resulting challenge, European healthcare systems need to take full advantage of new opportunities offered by technical advancements in ICT. The RADIO project explores a novel approach to user acceptance and unobtrusiveness: an integrated smart home/assistant robot system where health monitoring equipment is an obvious and accepted part of the user's daily life. By using the smart home/assistant robot as sensing equipment for health monitoring, we mask the functionality of the sensors rather than the sensors themselves. In this manner, sensors do not need to be discrete and distant or masked and cumbersome to install; they do however need to be perceived as a natural component of the smart home/assistant robot functionalities.",

Three interviews with project partners identified the nature and goals of the project, the composition of the team members, and the challenges, solutions, successes, and failures. Thematic analysis revealed three common themes spanning the projects which are likely to be issues in other technology innovation and research projects. The themes are navigating boundaries, succeeding at ``things you're not very good at'', and managing disparate teams. In this article we discuss the factors contributing to these thematic concerns, and present solutions that were helpful for the projects in the expectation that the knowledge generated from those working experiences is transferable to other projects that involve the intersection of technology development and social concerns.",

Learning methods are applied to recognize activities by utilizing the information obtained from the sensors installed in a smart home. In this paper, we present a comparative study using five learning models applied to activity recognition, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses under different challenging conditions. The challenges include high intra-class, low inter-class variations, unreliable sensor data and imbalance number of activity instances per class. The same sets of features are given as input to the learning approaches. Evaluation is performed using four publicly available smart home datasets. Analysis of the results shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Evidence-Theoretic K-nearest Neighbors (ET-KNN) in comparison to the learning methods Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) performed better in correctly recognizing the smart home activities.",

In this paper, we attempt to rectify this in consideration of context awareness and novelty detection for a smart home that monitors its inhabitant for illness and unexpected behaviour. We do this through the concept of the Use Case, which is used in software engineering to specify the behaviour of a system. We describe a set of scenarios and the possible outputs that the smart home could give and introduce the SHMUC Repository of Smart Home Use Cases. Based on this, we can consider how probabilistic and logic-based reasoning systems would produce different capabilities.",

abstract="The Florence project develops a robot for elderly that provides multiple Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Lifestyle services with a consistent user-interface. The project success is measured by the acceptance of these services by the user group. Enabling such service robotics in (smart) homes requires a robust and flexible platform to collect, enhance and distribute sensory information; and to manipulate the actuators in the environment. A key characteristic of such an environment is that sensors and actuators are not always available, are distributed, and are mobile (due to e.g. the robot and phone mobility). This dynamicity requires a loose coupling between services and sensors/actuators. The paper describes the design principles and high level architecture of the Florence platform that hides the distribution, availability and mobility aspects from the services, and sketches some challenges that lie ahead.",

The HCEE is placed within the economic flows of a bi-regional SAM for Italian economy which provides the data set for a CGE model where the hypothesis of involuntary unemployment is also considered. Two policy scenarios are then simulated to evaluate the impact of the policy reform in HCEE on total output and unemployment.

abstract="Avatars are a common field of research for interfacing smart homes, especially for elderly people. The present study focuses on the usage of photo-realistic faces with different levels of movements (video, avatar and photo) as components of the graphical user interface (GUI) for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments. Within a usability test, using the ''Wizard of Oz'' technique, these presentation modes were compared with a text and a voice only interface with users of the target groups: elderly people with (nMCI=12) and without (nMCI=12) Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Results show that faces on the GUI were liked by both, elderly with and without cognitive restrictions. However, users' performance on executing tasks did not differ much between the different presentation modes.",

abstract="Knowing human activity in each day is relevant information in several purposes. However, existing activity recognition systems have limitation to identify the human activity because they cannot get the appropriate information for recognition. To address this limitation, we present three relevant components in Context-aware Activity Recognition Engine (CARE) architecture for organizing context-aware information in home. First, we introduce Context Sensor Network (CSN). The CSN provides the raw environment information from the diversity of sensors. Second, data manager component is proposed to process the pre-processing in the raw data from the CSN. The data must be normalized and transformed in order to make the system more efficient. The last component is system repository that composes of three essential tasks for controlling the information in the system. In this paper, the ontology based activity recognition (OBAR) system is used to evaluate the data from proposed components. The high accuracy of results can refer to the well organization of proposed components.",

abstract="Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used in activity recognition. Ideally, the current activity should be determined using the vector of all sensor readings; however, this results in an exponentially large space of observations. The current fix to this problem is to assume conditional independence between individual sensors, given an activity, and factorizing the emission distribution in a naive way. In several cases, this leads to accuracy loss. We present an intermediate solution, viz., determining a mapping between each activity and conjunctions over a relevant subset of dependent sensors. The approach discovers features that are conjunctions of sensors and maps them to activities. This does away the assumption of naive factorization while not ruling out the possibility of the vector of all the sensor readings being relevant to activities. We demonstrate through experimental evaluation that our approach prunes potentially irrelevant subsets of sensor readings and results in significant accuracy improvements.",

abstract="An algorithm for decoding commands spoken in an intelligent environment through iterative vocabulary reduction is presented. Current research in the field of speech recognition focuses primarily on the optimization of algorithms for single pass decoding using large vocabularies. While this is ideal for processing conversational speech, alternative methods should be explored for different domains of speech, specifically commands issued verbally in an intelligent environment. Such commands have both an explicitly defined structure and a vocabulary limited to valid task descriptions. We propose that a multiple pass context-driven decoding scheme utilizing dictionary pruning yields improved accuracy; this occurs when one deals with command structure and a reduced vocabulary. Each iteration incorporates the hypothesis of the previous into its decoding scheme by removing unlikely words from the current language model. We have applied this decoding method to a comprehensive set of spoken commands through the use of Sphinx-4, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). When decoding via HMM, multiple previous states are used to determine the current state, thus utilizing context to aid in intelligent recognition. Our results show that within a fixed domain, multiple pass decoding yields recognition accuracy. Further research must be conducted to optimize practical context driven decoding and to apply the method to larger domains, primarily those of intelligent environments.",

To implement the smart home dream, an artificial intelligence has to be able to identify, in real-time, the ongoing activity of daily living with a fine-grained granularity. Despite the recent and ongoing improvements, the limitation of the literature on this subject primarily concerns the quality of the information which can be inferred from standard ubiquitous sensors in a smart home. Passive Radio-Frequency Identification is one of the technology that can help improving activity recognition through the tracking of the objects used by the resident in real-time. This paper builds upon the literature on objects tracking to propose a machine learning scheme exploiting statistical features to transform the signal strength into useful qualitative spatial information.

Nevertheless, services in smart homes can be critical especially when they involve health and wellness services, since faulty services can lead to unexpected/undesirable consequences. Therefore, robustness and availability are two fundamental requirements for service management protocols or middleware at homes. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptive failure detection and recovery mechanism, namely, the Rotating Roll-Call-based Protocol (RRCP), for home environments. Failures of software components are detected efficiently with a roll-call-based algorithm in which the roll-caller is elected periodically. Adaptive techniques and reliable UDP are adopted to maintain home network stability. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is robust even under elevated failure rates.",

The system is able to identify daily living activities with different levels of complexity using a temporal logic. It enables a real time response to emergency situations and also a long term analysis of the user daily routine useful to induce healthier lifestyles. The implementation addresses the applications and techniques used in the development of a functional prototype. To demonstrate the system operation three use cases with increasing levels of complexity are proposed and validated.

abstract="Activity recognition aims at modeling the occupants' behavior by analyzing the sensor data collected from the smart environment. Though most of the activity recognition systems use supervised learning techniques for building such models there is a shift towards the unsupervised learning paradigm as the process of annotating and labeling the data is prone to errors. This paper proposes an Event Pattern Activity Modeling Framework (EPAM) to identify the occupant activity pattern from the sensor data by using an unsupervised machine learning approach and further analysis is done with a knowledge driven approach. In the context of smart environments, an activity is considered as a sequence of events that are generated continuously from the sensor data. The segmentation algorithm proposed in EPAM is used to identify appropriate event patterns for an activity that are then grouped together using a pattern clustering algorithm that presents a hierarchy of activities. The set of activities of the occupant, observed in a smart environment is not always sequential but is highly interleaved and discontinuous. The proposed algorithm accommodates this valid factor by an innovative use of the Jaro Winkler similarity measure. The hierarchy of activity generated by the pattern clustering approach is used for activity modeling. Ontology based activity modeling is preferred over other modeling techniques because of its unified modeling, representation and semantically clear reasoning. The experimental results show that the proposed EPAM framework of segmentation, pattern clustering and ontological modeling is efficient and more effective than the existing approach of activity modeling.",

abstract="Smart Homes (SH) have emerged as a viable solution capable of providing assistive living for the elderly and disabled. Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to assist the inhabitants of a SH in performing the correct action(s) at the correct time in the correct place. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel logic-based approach to cognitive modeling based on a highly developed logical theory of actions - the Event Calculus.

The core goal of our work is to create a user-friendly interface system which can identify specific hand gestures and use them to control appliances in smart home environments. To control appliances with hand gestures, we use both static and dynamic hand gesture model to generate control commands. In our methodologies, we first recognize the hand parts in a depth silhouette via the trained random forests (RFs). Then based on the information of the recognized and tracked hand parts, we recognize static or dynamic hand gestures. Appliance control commands are finally generated according to our implemented appliance interfaces. With this interface system, users can control some typical appliances in smart home such as TV, fan, lighting, security camera, doors and change channels, temperature, and volume by just hand gestures.",

abstract="Over the last few years, activity recognition in the smart home has become an active research area due to the wide range of human centric-applications. A list of machine learning algorithms is available for activity classification. Datasets collected in smart homes poses unique challenges to these methods for classification because of their high dimensionality, multi-class activities and various deployed sensors. In fact the nature of dataset plays considerable role in recognizing the activities accurately for a particular classifier. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of smart home datasets characteristics on state-of-the-art activity recognition techniques. We applied probabilistic and statistical methods such as the Artificial Neural network,  Hidden Markov Model, Conditional Random Field, and Support Vector Machines. The four real world datasets are selected from three most recent and publically available smart home projects. Our experimental results show that how the performance of activity classifiers are influenced by the dataset characteristics. The outcome of our study will be helpful for upcoming researchers to develop a better understanding about the smart home datasets characteristics in combination with classifier's performance.",

This paper provides an overview of interesting projects developed with the aim to favor social inclusion and to tear down barriers posed by digital technology, by supporting people with special needs (e.g., elderly and people with different impairments) in the fruition of e-services through easy forms of interactions. The study is restricted to solutions that envisage the TV device as the main user interface for supporting Ambient Assisted Living. From the survey, a basic set of services and interfaces, here described, appear to be fundamental for improving digital and social inclusion, but the design methodology for developing TV-based interfaces and services must be carefully chosen to reduce social marginalization.",

abstract="As per the statistics of World Health Organization, a major percentage of elderly society across the globe is affected with dementia (age related memory loss). Dementia care entails prolonged effort in terms of money, time and manpower. Assistive health care system is therefore essential and is probable through a smart home, that offers Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) to its occupants. The objective of this work is to model an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for dementia care through the smart home. The innovation in the design of IDSS is to offer two levels of decision-making (1) Short-Term Decision-Making (STDM)---to raise suitable alerts for the abnormality detected in ADL (2) Long-Term Decision-Making (LTDM)---to decide on the progress in occupant's developmental stage of dementia. The novelty in the design of STDM is to assimilate Random Forest (data driven) decision-making and Rule-based (knowledge-driven) decision-making within a single framework. Random Forest modeling provides better predictive accuracy through ensemble learning which is later combined with the domain specific knowledge to offer context-based decision-making. On the other hand, LTDM decides on occupants developmental stage of dementia through automation of Barthel score. Barthel score is a clinical measure to assess the stage of dementia through the level of dependency required by the occupant to complete his activities. The experimental analysis confirms the proficiency of the proposed IDSS in decision-making is better than existing approaches.",

abstract="An increasingly popular technique of monitoring activities within a smart environment involves the use of sensor technologies. With such an approach complex constructs of data are generated which subsequently require the use of activity recognition techniques to infer the underlying activity. The assignment of sensor data to one from a possible set of predefined activities can essentially be considered as a classification task. In this study, we propose the application of a cluster-based classifier ensemble method to the activity recognition problem, as an alternative to single classification models. Experimental evaluation has been conducted on publicly available sensor data collected over a period of 26 days from a single person apartment. Two types of sensor data representation have been considered, namely numeric and binary. The results show that the ensemble method performs with accuracies of 94.2{\%} and 97.5{\%} for numeric and binary data, respectively. These results outperformed a range of single classifiers.",

abstract="Typically, when analysing patterns of activity in a smart home environment, the daily patterns of activity are either ignored completely or summarised into a high-level ``hour-of-day'' feature that is then combined with sensor activities. However, when summarising the temporal nature of an activity into a coarse feature such as this, not only is information lost after discretisation, but also the strength of the periodicity of the action is ignored. We propose to model the temporal nature of activities using circular statistics, and in particular by performing Bayesian inference with Wrapped Normal {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}(WN){\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}WN{\}}{\$}{\$}Mixture {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}(WNM){\}}{\$}{\$}models.

This paper proposes kernel fusion method, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to improve the accuracy of performed activities. Although, SVM is a powerful statistical technique, but still suffer from the expected level of accuracy due to complex feature space. Designing a new kernel function is difficult task, while common available kernel functions are not adequate for the activity recognition domain to achieve high accuracy. We introduce a method, to train the different SVMs independently over the standard kernel functions and fuse the individual results on the decision level to increase the confidence of each activity class. The proposed approach has been evaluated on ten different kinds of activities from CASAS smart home (Tulum 2009) real world dataset. We compare our SVM kernel fusion approach with the standard kernel functions and get overall accuracy of 91.41 {\%}.",

Vulnerable people are frequently excluded from the design of technologies that could in fact support them in tackling these risks. This paper explores designing with three vulnerable groups: children with special needs, chronically ill teenage patients, and isolated, or afraid of being so in the near future, elderly adults. We choose three distinct groups in order to show the breadth and variations in the ways in which people may be vulnerable. We looked at their digital lives and possible new risks and dependencies created by the use of digital technologies. Designing with vulnerable people is practically, methodologically, and ethically challenging. We show how methodological and reflexive sensibilities help to address these challenges and keep the design process on track.",

In this study, we proposed a machine learning based method for automatic identification of behavioral patterns of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the analysis of data related to their activities of daily living (ADL) collected in two smart home environments. Our method employs first a feature selection technique to extract relevant features for classification and reduce the dimensionality of the data. Then, the output of the feature selection is fed into a random forest classifier for classification. We recruited three groups of participants in our study: healthy older adults, older adults with mild cognitive impairment and older adults with Alzheimer's disease. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our proposed method. We experimentally showed that our method outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.",

abstract="Coping with the consequences of the demographic change, industrialized countries have to adapt their health care systems to the increasing medical need of older persons despite the threatening shortage of physicians. In this context, telemedical services for communication between doctors and patients come into fore. However, it is unclear in how far users accept these new care concepts. Crucial for the success of telemedical services is the choice of the medium and its perceived appropriateness in different using situations. In this paper, an exploratory approach was undertaken to examine the users' acceptance of four electronic communication media (telephone, videophone, videoconference, interactive wall) in three different usage situations (additional service, urgency situation, exclusively telemedical consultation). 200 participants volunteered to take part. Findings show that the acceptance strongly depends on the specific situation and the type of communication media. User diversity, in contrast, did not show a major role for the acceptance of telemedical consultation.",

This estimated face movement information is used in the face tracker for tracking faces in video images. Our experimental result shows a conspicuous improvement in the performance of the face tracking process in terms of success rates and with robustness against interruptions from face-like blobs.",

However, the proposed positioning or monitoring systems have high costs and power consumption. In addition, most proposed systems are demanded to match up a smartphone, but the smartphones bring other problems for elders and children.

abstract="The aim of this research project is to automatically analyse human behaviour in indoor environments using vibration sensors attached to the floor. Vibration sensors are used in an absolute passive manner so the monitored persons do not have to wear any sensors. Furthermore this technology preserves the private sphere of monitored persons. In order to extract geometric gait features like motion trajectories out of the vibrational signals, the main part of this work focuses on methods for localization of seismic sources on the two-dimensional floor surface. Starting from a conventional TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) based technique using uniaxial acceleration sensors we show how to minimize installation cost by reducing the number of sensor entities via tri-axial sensor technology. We describe the main challenges of wave propagation in solids, namely dispersion and multipath propagation and discuss their implications on robustness and accuracy of localization results. To conclude our work we introduce potential application scenarios.",

The proposed system is tested on a single room. A grid of ultrasonic sensors is placed in the ceiling of a room to monitor the position and the status of a person (standing, sitting, lying down). The sensors readings are wirelessly communicated through a microcontroller to a cloud. An intelligent system will read the sensors values from the cloud and analyses them using machine learning algorithms to predict the person behavior and status and decide whether it is a normal situation or abnormal. If an abnormal situation is concluded, then an alert with be risen on a dashboard, where a care giver can take an immediate action. The proposed system managed to give results with accuracy exceeding 90{\%}. Results out of this project will help people with supported needed, for example elderly people, to live their life as independent as possible, without too much interference from the caregivers. This will also free the care givers and allows them to monitors more units at the same time.",

In this work, we propose a novel machine learning approach for ADL recognitions by considering the location context information of the elder. With the popularity of smart phones, motion recognition can be done by the embedded sensors such as acceleration sensors and. However different ADL models possibly have the same movement to a certain degree, which will affect the classification performance.

Instead of traditional interface methodologies such as keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or remote control, users in smart home or environment can control smart appliances via their hand gestures. This chapter presents a novel hand gesture interface system via a single depth imaging sensor to control smart appliances in smart home and environment. To control the appliances with hand gestures, our system recognizes the hand parts from depth hand silhouettes and generates control commands. In our methodology, we first create a database of synthetic hand depth silhouettes and their corresponding hand parts-labelled maps, and then train a random forests (RFs) classifier with the database. Via the trained RFs, our system recognizes the hand parts from depth silhouettes. Finally based on the information of the recognized hand parts, control commands are generated according to our predefined logics. With our interface system, users can control smart appliances which could be TV, radio, air conditioner, or robots with their hand gestures.",

abstract="As capabilities, preferences and needs of people with disabilities are unique, personalization of ICT-based Assistive Technology (AT) tools is a key factor for their applicability. We developed a set of open source tools for Component-Based Engineering which allows an efficient prototyping, parameterization and application of user-driven AT. These tools include the AsTeRICS framework for creation of AT-applications from functional components via visual programming and the FlipMouse universal input system for finger- or mouth control of computers, tablets and smart phones. We present a conceptual framework for a user-centered Two-Level Personalization of AT which consists of a development phase, where a solution is modeled and refined in cooperation with a client, and a generalization phase to make this solution configurable via specific parameters which can be tuned when supporting other users in comparable contexts. Experience from customization is then used to improve more generic AT-solution-templates. This fosters a fast and cost-effective development of tailored support for people with disabilities. In this paper we describe in detail the tools and workflows employed. We present a single-subject study based on Participatory Action Research, involving a client with multiple sclerosis, and we demonstrate the Two-Level Personalization for the creation and evaluation of tailored applications for this client.",

abstract="The decrease in childbirth and the great increase in life expectancy represent typical demographic trends in industrialised countries. These tendencies make more concrete the issue regarding elderly people: the more they grow old, the more they are likely to need medical, social and personal care services. Nursing home care services are probably the most important example in terms of social costs, not only because they are extremely expensive from an economic point of view, but also because they determine a forced relocation of elderly people. To be compelled to live in a new place, completely depending on other people's assistance, has unquestionably a deep psychological impact (Hormuth, 1990): probably more difficult to assess than the economic expenditures, but definitely not less significant. Elderly people undoubtedly prefer living independently in a familiar domestic and residential setting. Anyway, a new series of problems arises, due to the shortage of residential infrastructures and facilities and the lack of home service workers compared to the large number of people who need assistance. As for domestic settings, in addition, the psychological impact of a long term home care assistance is still far from well understood: assistance provided by other people can generate a stronger negative influence upon final users, in that they may perceive a loss of control in their living space, and they may look at home service caregivers as privacy intruders. This condition may represent a menace to self-esteem and to the integrity of personal identity.",

abstract="Smart home technology became more and more widespread within recent years. They aim to make life easier and taking over unwanted tasks. In traditional homes, it is often not clear whether all windows and doors of a house are closed before inhabitants leave the home or go to sleep. However, this can be easily addressed by smart homes. We present a system based on opportunistically located ambient lights that assist inhabitants of a smart home in answering this question. In this paper, we show the concept of our system and the inhabitant-centered design process behind the development. The system was installed in a one-family smart home. We report on insights gained through data collected from this deployment over a period of six months. Within interviews, we found that the ambient light system gave inhabitants a more confident feeling about open doors/windows.",

The emerging pervasive technology has revolutionised the way of assistance in elderly care. Current solutions usually focus too much on technology, and fail to address the usability issues. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive system for both elderly care providers and elders. The system enables coordinators to manage care-givers and elders in an efficient way to improve service quality. For instance, care-givers can be scheduled in a real-time manner with mobile phones. We also deploy several sensors in their homes to monitor daily routines to ensure their safety. Alerts will be sent and accessible by coordinators immediately once detected, then elderly care services can be provided accordingly. We test our system in a real home for over 2 months.

abstract="In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.",

Ontology-based activity modelling is able to leverage domain knowledge and heuristics to create Activities of Daily Living (ADL) models with rich semantics. However, they suffer from incompleteness, inflexibility, and lack of adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning and evolving activity models. The approach uses predefined ''seed'' ADL ontologies to identify activities from sensor activation streams. We develop algorithms that analyze logs of activity data to discover new activities as well as the conditions for evolving the seed ADL ontologies. We illustrate our approach through a scenario that shows how ADL models can be evolved to accommodate new ADL activities and preferences of individual smart home's inhabitants.",

This paper proposes a smart pain management system based on big data computing technologies. The system devises pain management strategies based on the relevant standards and patients' data, and these strategies are identified, applied, and monitored by the system in real-time. A perpetual feedback loop is created among the system components and the outcomes are communicated to the stakeholders to enable reflections and continuous improvements in the pain management standards, strategies, and processes. The system architecture and its architectural components are described. A preliminary analysis is provided using handwritten and digital pain management related data.",

abstract="This work presents a multi-sensor platform integrating one or more commercial low-cost ambient sensors and one wearable device for the automatic assessment of the physical activity and sedentary time of an aged person. Each sensor node could operate in a stand-alone way or in a multi-sensor approach; in the last case, fuzzy logic data fusion techniques are implemented in a gateway in order to improve the robustness of the estimation of a physiological measure characterizing the level of physical activity and specific parameters for the quantification of a sedentary lifestyle. The automatic assessment was conducted through two main algorithmic steps: (1) recognition of well-defined set of human activities, detected by ambient and wearable sensor nodes, and (2) estimation of a physiological measure, that is (MET)-minutes. The overall accuracy for activity recognition, obtained using simultaneously ambient and wearable sensors data, is about 5{\%} higher of single sub-system and about 2{\%} higher of that obtained with more than one ambient sensor. The effectiveness of the platform is demonstrated by the relative error between IPAQ-SF score (used as ground-truth, in which a low score corresponds to a sedentary lifestyle whereas a high score refers to moderate-to-vigorous activity level) and average measured (MET)-minutes obtained by both sensor technologies (after data fusion step), which never exceeds 7{\%}, thus confirming the advantage of data fusion procedure for different aged people used for validation.",

Language models need to cover typical interaction patterns of older people, and acoustic models need to accommodate older voices. Further research is needed into intelligent adaptation techniques that will allow existing large, robust systems to be adapted with relatively small amounts of in-domain, age appropriate data. In addition, older users need to be supported with adequate strategies for handling speech recognition errors.",

abstract="Remote Control Systems (RCSs) are increasingly being installed in homes and offices. Technology evolves very rapidly and sensors and devices are becoming smaller, smarter and more powerful. Mobile and Web apps are commonly used to remotely configure and control devices. Home control is especially valuable for blind people, since they can benefit from technology to control and turn on/off devices autonomously. Remote control can offer meaningful support, especially when devices are not directly accessible (e.g., thermostat to manage heating temperature). Therefore, if RCS interfaces are not accessible via screen reader, blind users may miss a great opportunity to achieve greater autonomy at home. This paper investigates the accessibility of the web user interfaces offered by RCSs for blind people. To do this, the Fibaro, a popular Remote Control System, was tested as a case study by analyzing the interaction via screen reader. Results indicate that accessibility and especially usability need to be improved to make interaction easier and more satisfying for blind people. To this aim, some suggestions are offered to aid developers in designing more accessible RCS user interfaces.",

abstract="Family caregivers often assist their care recipients with a wide variety of activities ranging from basic personal care to transportation, medication management, finances and more. Furthermore, many caregivers live apart from the loved ones that they provide care to, and have responsibilities outside of caregiving including work and family. Use of technologies and services designed to make life easier for the general population can also be leveraged to reduce the burden and stress related with caregiving. In this study, 30 family caregivers were surveyed in depth to learn about their experiences with various technologies and services. Questions covered caregivers' use of technologies and services, perceived usefulness and ease of use, reasons for use and non-use, and ideas for new and improved tools. Many caregivers were currently using a technology or service for caregiving, but most of the technologies and services presented in the questionnaire were only used by a limited number of participants. While usage was limited, those that currently used technologies and services generally found them helpful for making caregiving duties easier. Responses showed that technologies and services were not being widely used mainly due to limited awareness and availability, and less because of lack of interest.",

In order to provide real-time monitoring and timely assistance to elderly in their home settings, we designed and developed a system employing model-based scenario verification, sensing-assisted activity recognition and semantic service reasoning. In this paper, we present the results achieved and lessons learned from conducting clinical trials with our developed solution at a dementia hostel. From trial data analysis, we could determine good system performance but no concrete evidences obtained on how the daily care operations and quality can be improved.

abstract="Partly due to the aging population around the world, job markets for developing biomedical devices and technology have been rapidly expanding. Organizations are recruiting engineers of various disciplines to design and test biomedical devices. This arouses interest of some engineering students to take academic subjects to learn some health technology, while keeping their main disciplines in specific engineering areas like mechanical engineering. Engineers need to have good understanding of the human body and different sorts of diseases, before they can apply good engineering solutions to solve the medical problems. However, teaching engineering students without prior education in medical-related aspects could be challenging. This paper presents the use of e-learning and some other interactive teaching approaches to facilitate master-degree engineering students to learn biomedical devices and technology. The factors which may assist in success in multi-disciplinary learning and the possibility of implementing the similar in undergraduate courses are discussed.",

abstract="Ten years ago, researchers in multi-agent systems became more and more aware that agent systems consist of more than only agents. The series of workshops on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS 2004-2006) emerged from this awareness. One of the primary outcomes of this endeavor was a principled understanding that the agent environment should be considered as a primary design abstraction, equally important as the agents. A special issue in JAAMAS 2007 contributed a set of influential papers that define the role of agent environments, describe their engineering, and outline challenges in the field that have been the drivers for numerous follow up research efforts. The goal of this paper is to wrap up what has been achieved in the past 10 years and identify challenges for future research on agent environments. Instead of taking a broad perspective, we focus on three particularly relevant topics of modern software intensive systems: large scale, openness, and humans in the loop. For each topic, we reflect on the challenges outlined 10 years ago, present an example application that highlights the current trends, and from that outline challenges for the future. We conclude with a roadmap on how the different challenges could be tackled.",

abstract="Portable Health Clinic is adapted to provide primary care to a super aged society. A super aged society occurs when, one third of the population is 65+ years and one fifth is 85+ years. The combination of aging society and incidence of non-communicable diseases increases the prevalence of elderly disability and places pressure on health care systems, health costs, and existing social norms. The goal is to reposition the Portable Health Clinic as a health information and affordable disability prevention system. In this paper, we show how the healthcare worker can supplement her competence on medical risk factors with sensor technology and share her knowledge with elderly patients within the community. We suggest that the remote telemedicine call center should be used to support distant screening and surveillance programs and provide early intervention to diseases. We investigate 18,278 Portable Health Clinic Electronic Health Records between 2012 and 2013 to see what are the most important risk factors for ill health in Bangladesh. The field data implies that elevated blood pressure and blood sugar and protein in the urine and the most important risk factors for the elderly population (>65 years) when compared to younger population,

abstract="In the 21st century, there has been an increase in the ageing population and people with disabilities in the majority of the world. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates suggest that the world total will be more than one billion people aged 60 or over by the year 2025 (Marshall et al., 2004). Thus, ageing population has been a growing concern in Turkey as in other countries. Especially in Turkey, where most Turks live in high-rise apartments, it is important to design housing universally. Turkish culture is based on a close relationship between the older people and their families. Today, rather than preferring specialised institutions, most of the older people want to live in their own houses, where they lived when they were younger. There is a crucial need for alternative daily living environments based on universal design that provides a higher level of accessibility, usability and adaptability for all users regardless of their size, age or ability. This study aims for a cultural understanding of the views of the Turkish older people on designing their homes for ageing in place. It is based on data from empirical research on universal design. The cultural differences between Turkey and places like the US, the UK and Europe, where most of the research in this area has been done, could provide fascinating insights.",

Some of the reasons for undertaking Design for All are discussed, and, making use of the analogy of the printed book, the paper then shows how Design for All in combination with Information technologies are enablers in the widest sense of the term. Finally, it is noted that Design for All is a process, not a product, and while there are people who specialise in eAccessibility, the research agenda demands more involvement from information technologists of all kinds.

In order to perform information service suitable to each person, the robot partner should extract the preference and daily behavior patterns of the person. Therefore, we propose a learning method of the relationship between human interaction and its corresponding behavior of the robot partner. In this paper, we use a robot music player; miuro, and we focus on the music selection for providing the comfortable sound field for the person. The experimental results show that the proposed method can learn the relationship between human interaction and its corresponding behavior, and that the proposed method can provide the person with the preferable song as the comfortable sound field. Furthermore, we show the seamless sharing of information between different types of robot partners.",

abstract="For impaired people, the conduction of certain daily life activities is problematic due to motoric and cognitive handicaps. For that reason, assistive agents in ambient assisted environments provide services that aim at supporting elderly and impaired people. However, these agents act in complex stochastic and indeterministic environments where the concrete effects of a performed action are usually unknown at design time. Furthermore, they have to perform varying tasks according to the user's context and needs, wherefore an agent has to be flexible and able to recognize required capabilities in a certain situation in order to provide adequate, unobtrusive assistance. Hence, an expressive representation framework is required that relates user-specific impairments to required agent capabilities. This work presents an approach which (a) describes and links user impairments and capabilities using the formal, model-theoretic semantics expressed in OWL2 DL ontologies, (b) computes optimal policies through Reinforcement Learning and propagates these in an agent network. The presented approach improves the collaborative, personalized and adequate assistance of assistive agents and tailors the agent-based services to the user's missing capabilities.",

abstract="Sleep disorders are common in the elderly, can be distressing to both the elderly and their carers, and often contribute to institutionalisation when the disruptive night behaviour of the older person exerts its toll on the carer. The main way of determining Sleep Activity Pattern (SAP) and aberrant changes in the normal sleep/wake cycle is through verbal reports of the patient and his/her carer, information that can be subjective, incomplete and unreliable. An emerging modality for SAP monitoring is actigraphy, involving the use of wearable sensors commonly based on accelerometers. To bring actigraphy to the next level in order to reap its benefit for the elderly population at large, one must consider its deployment in realistic settings such as nursing homes and in the homes of the subjects. In this paper we provide a brief account of the trial deployment of our SAP monitoring system in a nursing home, where data was collected from fifteen elderly residents for a period of two weeks each. Besides providing an objective basis for obtaining sleep related information from patients who are often unable to remember clearly how well they have slept, our system benefits staff and doctors by providing more accurate information as a supplement to the sleep diary, and hopefully even eliminate the need for the latter. Preliminary results are reported herein.",

abstract="Different degrees and types of visual impairment have become a common condition among the elderly, as aging inevitably affects the health and lifestyle of individuals. Partial or complete lack of sight is often accompanied by other ailments and conditions which further hinder the individual's activities. In this work, a novel Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) platform is proposed, aiming to support the functional capabilities of the elderly and visually impaired, thus ameliorating their lifestyle. This platform is based on indoor tracking of commonly used objects, such as medication packages. Accompanied by a proposed behavioural modeling methodology, the application also offers valuable observations that may indicate developing ill-health conditions in an early stage. The proposed platform was tested and evaluated by end-users in Spain, Greece and Finland.",

abstract="One of the biggest challenges we currently face is to keep elderly people immersed in their social environment when they leave their home and enter a retirement home. Many of them feel isolated. The TV stands as their favorite media, and our first experiments showed that listening to vocalized local news and receiving TV messages and photos from family helped in fighting these feelings of isolation. With online social networks, we wish to involve the elderly in new types of interactions, more various and frequent. They will be more active and included in micro-conversations around multimedia contents. The retirement homes will benefit also from social networking capabilities. They will participate to the local news dedicated to the elderly people. In addition, the remote family will be informed of activities through an agenda and various publications.",

abstract="Anomaly detection is a crucial issue for people with dementia and their families to live a safe and comfortable life at home. The elderly monitoring system is a promising solution. However, the conventional systems have limitations in detectable anomalies and support actions, which cannot fully cover individual needs. To achieve more person-centered home care for people with dementia, our research group has been studying environmental sensing with IoT. In this paper, using the environmental sensing, we propose a new service that allows individual users to customize definition of anomaly and corresponding actions. Specifically, borrowing a mechanism of context-aware services, we regard every anomaly observed within the house as a context. We then define every care as an action bound to an anomaly context. This achieves the personalized anomaly detection and care. To demonstrate the feasibility, we implement a prototype system and conduct a practical case study.",

abstract="Much of the literature on smart homes, smart living and eHealth focuses on either technology issues, such as home automation and sensor technology or the acceptance and adoption of smart home services. However, even smart home services that are technologically feasible and acceptable are not taken off as end-users cannot find them in today's fragmented marketplace with an overload of information. Basically there is a demand and supply mismatch. We argue that a matchmaking or brokering platform is required that helps end-users to search for smart living services and on the other hand support (service) providers promoting their products. In this paper, we propose a conceptual design for such a platform based on two series of exploratory interviews with stakeholders in the domain.",

abstract="As the world's population ages, the number of elderly people suffering from various diseases increases. Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. Advances in ubiquitous computing and wireless sensor networking have opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems. In-home pervasive networks may assist residents by providing memory enhancement, remote control of home appliances, medical data lookup and emergency communication. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents Home Healthcare Network (H2N), a complete system integrating the abundance of existing sensor nodes and other devices with pervasive, wireless networks. Our approach focuses on improving social aspects of elderly care besides the conventional care-giving functionalities. Finally, we talk about the importance of preserving privacy of such a system and propose a primitive solution for the inclusion of privacy awareness in the system. Although H2N is basically designed to function as a healthcare aide for the elderly people, with little customization it can be used to accommodate other user groups as well.",

By analyzing the effects of an enhanced Last Mile Mobility on children, adolescents and marginalized persons, we conclude to review the transport ecosystem as a whole. Based on this holistic view, we elaborate further on previously identified action areas, focusing first on the three action areas, which describe a transport system's service quality: spread of service areas, accessibility of provided services, and availability of demand-driven services. We continue to deepen our view on the potential role of paratransit services within the urban transport ecosystem (action area 4), and finally delve into policy needs and recommendations to maximize Last Mile mobility in Smart Cities (action area 5). We conclude our work with a suggestion for future pilot implementation based on our findings.",

This paper proposes an activity recognition system based on detection of acoustic events caused by residents within the living space. In the data collection process, an activity sound recording system with auto gain controlled and linearly amplified capability is equipped in a ward-like environment. The microphones are installed along the path from bedroom to lavatory. An activity sound database containing 105 designed scenarios is simulated and transcript in terms of 21 acoustic events such as footfall, fall down, and calling for help to form the acoustic event database. 21 Hidden Markov models (HMM) corresponding to acoustic events are trained by the acoustic event database. A keyword spotting recognition technology is adopted to recognize acoustic events and its ordered sequences for modeling activities. Acoustic features are computed by 39-dimensional mel-scaled frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with their first and second derivatives. The preliminary results show the average recognition rate of acoustic events is 91{\%} for inside testing and 72{\%} for outside testing respectively. The proposed approach shows an encouraging potential on the demand of modeling the regular living patterns of every variety.",

To achieve this purpose, we have attempted to create a real application working under illumination change and real-time requirement. The system observes the user's sign by a monitor-mounted camera and color gloves.

A questionnaire survey involving 277 valid responses was conducted. This study examined that both pleasure expectancy and the four influencing constructs in UTAUT showed significantly positive effects on user adoption of social robots. In addition, based on the results, aging adults slightly did not think they could get pleasure from social robots whereas they had slightly preference to accept social robots.

abstract="This paper confronts commonly-made assumptions about older adults and their general levels of capability when interacting with technology by reporting from an evaluation involving 49 older adults (M = 81 years) where performance was studied during task solving on a touch-based interface. The tasks involved were derived from a set of corresponding psychomotor abilities that are commonly involved in interaction mechanisms associated with touchscreen devices: precision, steadiness, dexterity, speed, and coordination. The evaluation consisted of measuring the performance of participants as well as having them assessing their own performance. To provide empirical results on why it is argued that it can be dangerous to assume anything about the capabilities of older adults, multiple analyses of the gathered data were used to highlight individual, group-related, and general patterns. Important relations, levels of variance, and statistically significant effects are highlighted as the paper argues for how these particular results do not align with common assumptions. The discussion draws on both the empirical results as well as related research to advocate why designers should acknowledge individual capabilities to ensure maximized performance when designing enabling technology for older adults.",

The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of potential incentives for using AAL technologies. The data was coded using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). In total 13 incentives could be identified, which were grouped into six categories: (1) social incentives, (2) health and safety incentives, (3) activity incentives, (4) novel sensory incentives, (5) status incentives and (6) self-reactive incentives. Within these categories `social connectedness' and `health and safety' were the most important incentives.

The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of `ambient assisted living' as an instantiation of the concept of `intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the idea of `ambient assisted living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.",

In this paper, leveraging the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) and multi-antenna setting in commodity WiFi devices, we design and implement a real-time, non-intrusive, and low-cost indoor fall detector, called Anti-Fall. For the first time, the CSI phase difference over two antennas is identified as the salient feature to reliably segment the fall and fall-like activities, both phase and amplitude information of CSI is then exploited to accurately separate the fall from other fall-like activities. Experimental results in two indoor scenarios demonstrate that Anti-Fall consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall, with 10{\%} higher detection rate and 10{\%} less false alarm rate on average.",

abstract="Advances in networking and small sensors (motes, RFID tags, etc) have made it possible to monitor and provide medical assistance to people in need at their homes. Recently, WISP tags, one advanced technology of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, have been used to monitor indoor activity, vital signs, sleep quality, and health status remotely. These types of systems take collaborative decision based on the data collected from all the WISP tags of the system. Any missing tag data within the environment may introduce critical error in the system's decision and this eventually may jeopardize system's decision reliability. In order to maintain system's reliability, a monitoring protocol needs to be executed frequently and it should be made efficient in terms of execution time. This paper studies the problem of monitoring a large set of WISP tags and identifying the missing ones. In this paper, based on probabilistic methods, we propose a monitoring protocol for WISP based Smart Healthcare Monitoring Systems. The goal of this protocol is to improve the security and reliability of a smart healthcare monitoring system by detecting missing tags and reporting back only the data of the existing tags.",

abstract="A rapidly growing elder population is placing unprecedented demands on health care systems around the world. Cognitive decline is one of the most taxing health problems in terms of both its relation to elders' overall functioning and the cost of care. The needs of elders with cognitive decline -- for invisible, intuitive support and assessment -- invite a reconsideration of the assumptions behind and specifications for ubiquitous computing solutions. This paper describes findings and implications of ethnographic research conducted with cognitively impaired individuals and their informal care networks in 45 households in 5 U.S. regions. Key themes regarding needs and barriers to successful aging are addressed through a set of design principles which apply across the stages of cognitive decline. To convey stage-specific findings and associated challenges for ubiquitous computing, case studies of four representative households and example concept solutions are presented. The design principles and technology challenges outlined in this paper may generalize to other contexts for ubiquitous computing.",

Our findings indicate that the ``smart gym'' does not address the complexities of exercise for an elderly person: in order to exercise one has to master the gym equipment and its technology, cognitively as well as bodily. Both the equipment and the smart technology turn out to be difficult to master by its elderly users. Our study reports these difficulties and suggests a more nuanced concept of mastery as a way to address the challenges in designing for elderly users. We unfold physical and bodily dimensions of mastery and consider how these differ between individuals, and within the context and situation.",

abstract="For monitoring and controlling unwanted events like intrusion of burglars/thieves at home/locality/city, the security systems are much required. In this paper, an efficient and low-cost wireless security system is proposed with ZigBee and GSM modems. In the proposed system, city is divided into sections and sections into colonies/sectors. The section security system comprises multiple cluster nodes with one cluster head. Cluster nodes and cluster head are linked via ZigBee network. The cluster heads of all sections communicate with central control room (main server) of the city via GSM in order to make its coverage area large. The network optimization for efficient routing of the cluster node and cluster head is done using PSO algorithm. Cluster node is an embedded device connected with ZigBee modem and switches in each room as per user's requirement. If there is an intrusion at home, in any locality of the city, the resident is to press the switch. This information is communicated by cluster node through ZigBee network to the corresponding cluster head which in turn communicates to the central control room (main server) via GSM network. Cluster head is equipped with audio alarm system like a hooter and this system is activated as soon as the switch in the cluster node is pressed. The identity of cluster node is conveyed to the cluster head via communication network. For future enhancement, the system in the cluster node may be fitted with other sensors like temperature, smoke, fire, etc., for detection of various hazardous conditions.",

abstract="Existing activity recognition based assistive living solutions have adopted a relatively rigid approach to modelling activities. To address the deficiencies of such approaches, a goal-oriented solution has been proposed that will offer a method of flexibly modelling activities. This approach does, however, have a disadvantage in that the performance of goals may vary hence requiring differing video clips to be associated with these variations. In order to address this shortcoming, the use of rich metadata to facilitate automatic sequencing and matching of appropriate video clips is necessary. This paper introduces a mechanism of automatically generating rich metadata which details the actions depicted in video files to facilitate matching and sequencing. This mechanism was evaluated with 14 video files, producing annotations with a high degree of accuracy.",

Unfortunately, most people suffering from sleep disorders remain without diagnosis and treatment since the current sleep assessment systems are cumbersome and expensive. As a result, there is an increasing demand for cheaper and more affordable sleep monitoring systems in real-life environments. In this paper, we propose a novel non-intrusive system for sleep quality monitoring using a microbend fiber optic mat placed under the bed mattress. The sleep quality is assessed based on different parameters. Moreover, the sensor has been integrated into an existing Ambient Assisted Living framework to be validated in real scenarios. Three senior female residents participated in our study and the sleep data was collected over a one-month period in a home-living situation. The proposed system shows accurate and consistent results with a survey collected from each participant showing their sleep patterns and other in-home activities.",

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) platforms are seen as a viable way for managing healthcare costs in an ever aging first world population. One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost ``off-the-shelf'' technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial ``observations from the field'' taken during the USEFIL AAL platform's integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

abstract="Continuous monitoring of safety and health conditions are among the primary goals of Ambient Assisted Living technologies. Effective solutions, aimed at fostering independent life of elderly persons, need for carefully balancing system intrusiveness, perspicacity, reliability and cost features. Heterogeneous networks, including different combination of environmental and personal (wearable) sensors can be used, with relevant value coming from data fusion: analysis techniques, aiming at inferring safety and health-related information in an indirect fashion from behavioral features are being deeply investigated with this aim. Device cooperation and interoperability are thus key factors: in this paper, the development of a wearable sensor suitable for broad range AAL application is introduced, addressing features specifically oriented to behavioral analysis. First, the device itself is capable of analyzing different features of the user motion patterns, synthesizing high-level information (simple task identification, energy expenditure) on board. This result in better battery management (less data transferred over the radio link) and interoperability (thanks to data abstraction). Second, by means of a suitable operating protocol, it cooperates with environmental sensors (e.g., a toilet sensor) providing the latters with user identification information, and thus allowing to exploit related data even in a multi-user context. This avoid the need of more expensive and complex indoor localization techniques or of more intrusive identification technologies (e.g., NFC/RFID tags).",

The methods of this review involve literature search of accessible studies dealing with the topic on the exploitation of mobile phones and/or smartphones in dementia found in three acknowledged databases Science Direct, Web of Science, and MEDLINE. Furthermore, the results of the detected studies were compared and evaluated. The results of this article show that the use of mobile phones and/or smartphones by patients with dementia can provide support for the activities of daily life. In addition, they can reduce both mental and economic burden of their caregivers and help doctors in their assessments and diagnoses. Nevertheless, more original research studies, especially in the area of the effectiveness of their use should be conducted.

abstract="The vision of smart living promises innovative services from providers in energy, healthcare, entertainment and surveillance sectors. While smart homes used to equal home automation, evolving ICT technologies now enable truly adaptive and intelligent services that are integrated in several industries. Sector-specific service platforms are emerging that provide basic intelligence for services. However, smart living services should not be constrained to a specific industry sector, and hence the service platforms should be easily accessible for service providers regardless of their industry. In addition, smart living services should not be constrained to residents within the home, but should take advantage of outdoors position information to open up a range of novel service concepts. Establishing such a vision of smart living involves various technological and organizational challenges. This paper gives an overview of the current service platforms for smart homes and positioning information. Based on this overview, we propose a research agenda for enabling smart living services. The two major issues are how to achieve collective action between players from multiple sectors in order to set up a common service platform, and how to design business models that allow adding GNSS-based positioning information to the service platform.",

It allows adults living with autism and their caregivers to create personalized smart home interventions that provide motivational support for activities of daily living, social relationships, and safer behaviors. This is achieved through the use of a ubiquitous computing system composed of off-the-shelf consumer electronic technologies. The Environmental Rating Scale (ERS), designed to assess residential interventions for people living with autism, guided the development and evaluation of CARE/ERS heuristics and interaction scenarios. The contributions of this investigation, advanced through an iterative design process involving expert reviewers, caregivers, and end-users in a patient centered approach for the design of actualizing e-health interventions, can be readily applied to a broad range of residential circumstances that improve quality of life.",

It argues for a departure from the deficit model of old age, to an understanding that reveals older people's agency in the ageing process and the work they do to manage their capacity to age well. This reframing of ageing and the ageing population offers new insights to CSCW and suggests new goals to support when designing technology for older people---goals that are more cognizant of people's agency and their desires to manage their evolving experiences of the ageing process. We conclude with characteristics of the technologies we might develop.",

Meanwhile, smart home based health monitoring services are evolving rapidly to become a viable alternative to traditional healthcare solutions. Such services can augment qualitative analyses done by gerontologists with quantitative data. Hence, the recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) has become an active domain of research in recent times. For a system to perform human activity recognition in a real-world environment, multiple requirements exist, such as scalability, robustness, ability to deal with uncertainty (e.g., missing sensor data), to operate with multi-occupants and to take into account their privacy and security. This paper attempts to address the requirements of scalability and robustness, by describing a reasoning mechanism based on modular spatial and/or temporal context models as a network of ontologies. The reasoning mechanism has been implemented in a smart home system referred to as Arianna{\$}{\$}^{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}.

If the designer can't understand the users' needs in time and objectively, and accurately construct the users' mental model, it will make the design decision blurred and slow, and the design scheme lacks the utility. Taking into account the drawbacks of traditional user research methods, we use the multidimensional data collaborative analysis technology to obtain user, environment, tasks and other context information. The interaction between the user and the product service system is selected, and the context data of the target user is acquired by using the wearable device, the eye movement measurement and behavior analysis system.

abstract="The ICT-based elderly monitoring systems attract great attention as a promising technology for home elderly care. However, the conventional systems have limitations of deployment cost and invasiveness, the effort of activity labeling, and a lack of communication. To cope with the limitations, we propose a system that captures activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, based on speech dialogue triggered by environment changes. Specifically, we deploy Autonomous Sensor Boxes, developed in our previous study, within a house of the elderly. The boxes gather and send house environmental data to the cloud. Then, the Change Finder algorithm is applied to the time-series data, to detect changes in the house online. On detecting a change, the Virtual Agent (VA) in the house asks the elderly what he/she is doing now. The elderly speaks to the VA, by which an ADL is recorded in the system. The proposed system can capture ADL with non-invasive sensing and create an opportunity for communication.",

abstract="Technology acceptance of conventional Information and Communication technologies (ICT) devices is extensively researched within the last twenty years. However, comparably small knowledge is prevalent with respect to ubiquitous ICT in the living environment. Furthermore, there is nearly no data about user acceptance's dependency of integrated technologies on varying domestic spaces and how acceptance varies regarding user diversity. This study explores the acceptance of home-integrated ICT (hands-free equipment, camera, positioning system). In different domestic spaces (living room, bedroom, bathroom) acceptance for integrated technology was assessed, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods. Results show that users' acceptance differs considerably depending on the room type (acceptance is the highest in the living and the lowest in the bathroom). Moreover, the most disliked technology for home monitoring are camera-based systems, followed by the positioning system and the microphone. Also, there was a significant interacting effect of room type and technology: While none of these technologies is accepted for the bathroom, the living room is less sensitive to their presence with the microphone as the most accepted technology. User diversity does not play a major role hinting at generic acceptance patterns regarding ICT integrated in home environments.",

abstract="Ageing is a global challenge. As health conditions gradually deteriorate, elders are prone to suffering from multiple chronic diseases. The impact of ageing on the heath system is therefore unprecedented. Primary and preventive care is important to ensure older adults to receive immediate healthcare so that their health problems can be handled and alleviated in a timely manner, thus reducing the risk of development into serious illnesses. However, degradation of mobility in elderly becomes a hurdle to the access of healthcare services. In the paper, we present an outreach community healthcare model via a mobile clinic, which provides health assessment, interventions and health education to community-dwelling elderly. A key highlight of the mobile healthcare model is the adoption of healthcare information system (HIS) to streamline the operations and to enable smooth service delivery even with tight human resource. The role of information technology, the resulting benefits and outcomes are discussed in the paper. The HIS-leveraged mobile healthcare model is highly praised by the community and serves as an exemplar for establishing mobile clinics for various healthcare services.",

Our research tackles challenges in Chinese chronic disease entity extraction from three aspects: Chinese health lexicons construction, feature development, and equivalence conjunctions tagging. We construct large scale Chinese health lexicons based on expert knowledge and the Web resources; develop a feature extraction approach that draws out character, part-of-speech, and lexical features from QA data; and improve the performance of answer entity extraction by leveraging equivalence conjunctions (punctuation marks and conjunctional words) in Chinese to capture dependencies between tags of entities. Experiments on question and answer entity extraction demonstrate that the Precision, Recall and F-1 score are improved using our proposed features, and the Precision and F-1 score can be further improved by considering equivalence conjunctions.",

abstract="Ubiquitous Healthcare (u-healthcare) which focuses on automated applications that can provide healthcare to citizens anywhere/anytime using wired and wireless mobile technologies is becoming increasingly important. Ubiquitous healthcare data provides a mine of hidden knowledge which can be exploited in preventive care and ``wellness'' recommendations. Data mining is therefore a significant aspect of such systems. Distributed Data mining (DDM) techniques for knowledge discovery from databases help in the thorough analysis of data collected from healthcare facilities enabling efficient decision-making and strategic planning. This paper presents and discusses the development of a prototype ubiquitous healthcare system. The prospects for integrating data mining into this framework are studied using a distributed data mining system. The DDM system employs a mixture modelling mechanism for data partitioning. Initial results with some standard medical databases offer a plausible outlook for future integration.",

The pathologic persistence (called also perseveration) in tasks of daily life is a marker of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, and its non-invasive detection can lead to early diagnosis, if it triggers a battery of diagnostic tests based on imaging, clinical neurology and cognitive tests to confirm the suspicion of neuronal degeneration. Finally, the tele-monitoring of daily activity, called actimetric monitoring, allows the detection of abnormal repetitive tasks, and contributes also to the content of a custom folder of health data, which can provide a therapeutic education adapted to the person followed at home.",

The effect of using such technology promotes a level of independence in addition to improving social awareness and interactions [1]. As trends in life expectancy increase, the number of age related impairments and chronic disease within the elderly population will also rise. While for some of these conditions there is no cure, with the help of assistive technology, diseases such as Alzheimer's for example may be effectively managed. Assistive technology within this domain can be used to support activities such as medication reminders, picture dialing phones and clocks to support day/night orientation.

abstract="The population of the world is aging and one of the main concerns of the aged care industry is to provide appropriate care for elderly people as their health and independent functioning declines. This paper reports a systematic review of the roll of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) in elderly wellbeing, based on Cochrane principles. Relevant publications from diverse databases, including healthcare, engineering, and robotics were sourced and screened. Ninety-five studies in forty-two study groups have been synthesized. The reported outcomes have been categorized based on five PERMA constructs (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement) in addition to a sixth category (other effects). The findings indicate that SAR has the potential to enhance elderly wellbeing and decrease the workload of caregivers. Based on concerns that emerged during the quality appraisal process, several significant recommendations are made to improve future research and its applicability. Furthermore, acknowledging individuals' needs, expectations, and preferences alongside multi-modal interaction and data collection translates into improvement of personalization of care. The development of new approaches such as web-based interfaces and cloud computing are highly recommended as the means of overcoming the constraints of the limited computing and storage capabilities of SAR. Moreover, human-like engagement characteristics of socially assistive robots should be seamlessly integrated with other assistive technologies such as tele-health, e-health, and smart homes.",

Quantitatively assessing exercise performance is vital in monitoring the progress in exercise based rehabilitation.

In this paper, we propose to evaluate the performance of upper extremity reaching tasks with in a kinematic perspective by assessing the smoothness of motion trajectories with the entropy of shape model, including curvature and torsion. The simulation result confirms that approximate entropy of shape model is consistent with the change of the smoothness in motion trajectory while it is capable of classifying six levels of the ability to perform upper extremity reaching tasks with higher accuracy.",

Therefore we developed a ZigBee-based smart system which uses distributed accelerometers as main sensory component and does not need the resident to wear any artifact. In this way certain activity patterns could be recognized respecting the users' privacy. We gathered certain ADLs manually from the raw data and validated them in different ways.

abstract="This paper describes how emerging context-awareness technologies will act as a driving force for introduction of intelligently personalized services in smart spaces. The according context-awareness framework is taken from the results of the EU FP 7 project ``C-CAST''. Major novelties include a highly scalable context management architecture as well as a context prediction methodology. The paper considers business models and financial structures as well as service and application examples that might be realized in smart spaces enriched with environmental, personal, social, and network context information. From a commercial perspective on context-aware applications in smart spaces, these examples differ from traditional Telecom and IT services and demonstrate how Telecom and IT companies may strengthen and leverage their business based on context information about customers, services and their environments that is abundantly available in smart spaces. Moreover, this paper includes the description of a field trial with new applications in quasi-smart space environments.",

abstract="Fall is the most significant causes of injury for Elderly or Epilepsy. This has led to develop a many types of automatic fall-detection systems. However, prevalent methods only use accelerometers to isolate falls from activities of daily living (ADL). This paper proposes combination of a simple threshold method and acceleration measurement to detect falls and fall-detection. To demonstrate the activity of proposed scheme a device has been designed. We used an Arduino-UNO, also we used MPU6050 as a sensor and we can measure the velocity and acceleration by calculate the derivative for the phase this program was C-language. Several fall-feature parameters and possible falls are calibrated through an algorithm. The implementation of program built to read an analogue variable from its port as an additional adjustment to fixed the upper and the lower. The total sum acceleration vector ACC to distinguish between falling and ADL. The results using the simple threshold, PMU, and combination of the simple method and MPU were compared and analyzed. The proposed MPU reduced the complexity of the hardware also the algorithm exhibited high accuracy.",

Without them there would be no design, and without them there would be no improvements. Throughout the course of this research we have attempted to work with the participants as equals in the project and reflect their wishes in the final designs. It has been a learning experience for all members of the team. We also see that although the applications have been developed on tablets for tablet PCs there is no reason why we cannot use them on standard computers. Similarly, although the applications were developed for older people by older people, there is no reason why they cannot have as much worth with other people in the wider world.",

Our aim is to enable senior citizens to remain in their familiar home environments as long as possible by increasing their feeling for safety and autonomy in a minimally invasive way. Therefore we developed a ZigBee-based smart system which uses distributed accelerometers as main sensory component and does not need the resident to wear any artifact. In this way certain activity patterns could be recognized respecting the users' privacy. We gathered certain ADLs manually from the raw data and validated them in different ways. In this manner 151 out of 155 ADLs could be verified. In this paper an overview of the system together with the findings of the real life tests are presented.",

The authors present an overview of the work-in-progress of policymaking through a series of methods and tools to encourage participation and identifying consistent and low cost policy choices in PA. We conclude that this bottom-up approach, which is very different from the technology-based smart city paradigm, is extremely useful. It provides institutions with a simple, immediate and free use of a pool of ideas. It also supports administrational structures by organizing a number of basic services in low density rural areas affected by structural limitations in terms of accessibility, loss of population and public services in a better manner and at lower cost.",

In this paper, we present a smartphone app designed to facilitate, encourage and monitor behaviour change as part of a 6-month randomized control trial with 146 participants. The app provided a convenient, scalable and cost effective method of allowing participants to monitor and review behaviour change data. 94.5{\%} of users entered, and 91.8{\%} reviewed, their performance daily. Over 141,800 individual behaviour logs were submitted across the six-month trial. Analysis of these logs has shown positive trends in behavioural change across all domains, with particular emphasis on efforts to decrease stress, higher sleep promotion and increased social engagement. Respondents' rating of the app's effect on their health improvement: 31{\%} reported ``a great deal of effect'', 48{\%} reported somewhat of an effect, and 3{\%} said the app was the key factor.",

It is mainly based on an IXP425 network processor and a Linux kernel. We first present the hardware and software architectures of BMMRG, and then we introduce their in-detailed implementations. In the meantime, an intelligent home system is proposed based on BMMRG and household appliances equipped with wireless and ZigBee adapters.

A search through four large databases, followed by filtering by relevance, led to the identification and subsequent review of papers. Our review revealed that the majority of research in this area focuses on the support of day-to-day living activities, safety monitoring, memory aids and preventing social isolation. We conclude that the majority of AT currently available support day-to-day living activities, safety monitoring and assisting healthcare. However these devices merely address the `ease of living' rather than focusing on `quality of life'. Although there are some devices which address social symptoms of Dementia, few address behavioural issues such as aggression and virtually none are available to support recreational activities. After discussing the implications of these findings, we finally reflect on general design issues for assistive technologies in this domain that became apparent during the review.",

The novel cognitive framework called high dimensional conceptual space is proposed and used as KID model. This KID model is built using geometrical framework of conceptual spaces and formal concept analysis (FCA) to overcome imprecise concept notation of conceptual space with the help of topology based FCA. By doing so, conceptual space can be represented using Hilbert space. This high dimensional conceptual space is quantum inspired in terms of its concept representation. The knowledge learnt by the KID model recognizes the daily activities of the elderly. Consequently, the model identifies the scenario on which the wellness of the elderly has to be ensured.",

abstract="Over the past decades, a plethora of innovative ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems have been constructed. The acceptance of the systems, however, depends on how users experience them in real contexts. While many of the ubicomp research projects include some form of user study, there is no overview of how user experience (UX) is approached in ubicomp research. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of ubicomp UX studies. Our findings reveal that users`experiences with ubicomp systems have often been investigated in rather lightweight ways, for example by addressing basic usability issues, collecting ratings by simple, predetermined scales, or producing descriptions of general experiences such as fun and trust. Based on the findings we argue that a deeper and more fine-grained understanding of user experience would help developing more successful ubicomp systems. We propose a ubicomp UX framework that can help design and evaluate ubicomp systems with a desirable set of target experiences.",

Furthermore, a practical workflow is presented, that helps the technicians that setup the device to perform a fast, user-friendly and robust tuning and calibration procedure. As a result, the technician is capable of ``training'' the device without any need for prior knowledge of machine learning techniques. The proposed system has been evaluated against a particular scenario that is rather important in the context of any healthcare monitoring system for the elder: In particular, we have focused on the ``bathroom scenario'' according to which, a Raspberry PI device equipped with a single microphone is used to monitor bathroom activity on a 24/7 basis in a privacy-aware manner, since no audio data is stored or transmitted. The presented experimental results prove that the proposed framework can be successfully used for audio event recognition tasks.",

abstract="Exploring the hierarchical structure and internal correlation of chronic disease knowledge network is of great significance to distinguish conceptual terms and core directions of chronic disease area. This paper proposed a descriptive Tomographic Content Analysis method to analyze the cross-section of chronic disease knowledge network. K-core values and clustering coefficients were applied to divide the network into layers. Then vectors for each layer were constructed to calculate their cosine similarities to compare their correlation and differences. Finally, network stratification results were compared with the community modules obtained by the traditional social network analysis from a quantitative perspective. To illustrate the method, a number of 26,717 articles related to hypertension in the PubMed database were taken as examples to construct the chronic disease knowledge network. Results show that the chronic disease knowledge network can be divided into the basic layer, the middle layer and the detailed layer. The basic layer can be used to divide the main research directions of chronic diseases. The detailed layer can be used to characterize the specific research and reveal the microscopic forms of the network. The middle layer can be used to explore the network intersection and evolution paths. Compared with the traditional social network analysis method, our proposed method can obtain more in-depth and detailed hierarchical structures and internal correlations of chronic disease knowledge networks.",

abstract="The wide spread prevalence of mobile devices, the decreasing costs of sensor technologies and increased levels of computational power have all lead to a new era in assistive technologies to support persons with Alzheimer's disease. There is, however, still a requirement to improve the manner in which the technology is integrated into current approaches of care management. One of the key issues relating to this challenge is in providing solutions which can be managed by non-technically orientated healthcare professionals. Within the current work efforts have been made to develop and evaluate new tools with the ability to specify, in a non-technical manner, how the technology within the home environment should be monitored and under which conditions an alarm should be raised. The work has been conducted within the remit of a collaborative patient-carer system to support self-management for dementia. A visual interface has been developed and tested with 10 healthcare professionals. Results following a post evaluation of system usability have been presented and discussed.",

Ten relatively healthy independently living older adults were interviewed using ethnographic processes to determine a baseline of social activities, behaviours and nocturnal sleeping routines. Each home was fitted with six sensing elements to establish and monitor daily and nocturnal activities. Sociality behaviours were explored through social contact through phone conversation and human interaction, through mobility, inside and outside the home, and through a person's self reported internal state (how they feel each day). Nocturnal rhythms were examined through actigraph watches and bed pressure sensing devices. A preliminary sub set of the results are presented in this paper in the form of case studies showing subjective and objective data sets and their comparison to social routines.",

To cope with these problems, this paper presents a publicly available awareness game called Smart Tales, whose goal is to enhance the familiarity of its players with the notion and core concepts of AAL. In Smart Tales, the player has the role of an assisted patient in a smart home, and gets to learn about AAL and its technologies while trying to cheat the sensors that are placed in the house. In addition to presenting the design of the game following the Serious Games Design Assessment framework from the literature, we present results on engagement and learning that we obtained through a formative evaluation with ten users.",

The study comprises three phases: (i) review of related solutions; (ii) development of a prototype app for active ageing; and (iii) evaluation. The last phase consisted the evaluation procedure, where the User Experience Questionnaire has been used. Results revealed that the prototype of the application falls in the range of 10{\%} of the best results when perspicuity, efficiency, dependability and novelty are considered.",

abstract="Recently the importance of autonomous monitoring has become an essential part of the society. Autonomous monitoring and control in a home environment can lead to energy savings. Also autonomous monitoring can serve as an alerting mechanism when something is out of the norm so that the controlling mechanism can rectify the problem. In this paper we present a system we developed using multiple sensors for autonomous monitoring and control with relatively low cost components. The sensors we integrated together in to one central operation unit can monitor room temperature, humidity, human motion activity etc. We present a prototype implementation of an energy efficient home environment using our proposed centralized monitoring platform. Using a sample scenario we show that the energy consumption in a smart home is about 15kWh while that of a normal home is about 35kWh.",

As a framework of the research presented here, we introduce a currently running interdisciplinary research project in which novel textile input devices are to be developed, iteratively designed, and evaluated. In order to learn about the individual requirements for using smart textiles in a home context, we carried out a exploratory questionnaire study in which 72 participants (aged 20-76) evaluated perceived benefits and barriers of smart textiles in the home context. Results show a first insight into user experience and the general willingness to adopt smart textile input devices. Also, the perceived suitability of functions to be controlled by those novel input devices as well as the reported appropriateness of different rooms and general device styles into which smart input devices could be integrated were collected. Results show, overall, a high willingness of participants to use smart textiles as input devices.",

Indeed, in this research work, we propose a platform that addresses the problem of energy management of different electric devices in a smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT) building and particularly high performance computing (HPC) data centers. This platform integrates the mobile technology as a means to facilitate the maintenance operations usually executed by the mobile workforce agents on smart building electric devices. Another important issue integrated in this proposed platform deals with the monitoring of a life safety plan in case of an emergency scenario due, for instance, to fire detection. The emergency rescue monitoring is eased by the use of mobile devices such as the tablets, usually handled by people in a smart ICT building.",

Several approaches are proposed to recognize activities namely intrusive and non-intrusive approaches. This paper presents a new fully non-intrusive approach for recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart environments. Our approach treats the activity recognition process as an information retrieval problem in which ADLs are represented as hierarchical models, and patterns associated to these ADLs models are generated. A search process for these patterns is applied on the sequences of activities recorded when users perform their daily activities. We show through experiments on real datasets recorded in real smart home how our approach accurately recognizes activities.",

abstract="Our research group has been studying person-centered care (PCC) support systems for elderly people living at home, using contextual information of individual users (called user context). PCC is an ideal care principle, which monitors and understands individual circumstances, and plans and executes optimized care. Since the current systems individually manage different user contexts, reusing the contexts across multiple systems is quite different. In this paper, we propose a new service that uniformly manages the user context, and allows external applications to retrieve necessary user contexts efficiently. More specifically, the proposed service gathers heterogeneous data from different systems, and standardizes the data with a common database with domain-independent attributes of when, who, whom, where, what, how, and why. Using a practical use case, we show how the proposed service efficiently manages user contexts.",

Following a user-centric design approach through cultural probes, we have explored the design space of possible programming opportunities for elderly users. Accordingly we have identified interaction techniques and candidate artefacts that could offer this user group a seamless programming experience for augmenting their ambient environment with software driven personalized behavior. Three aspects of programming - behavior generation, modification and (de) activation are addressed using two tangible user interfaces - i) NFC cards for smart behavior creation and modification and ii) a digital memo board as a placeholder for (de) activation of intelligent behavior. A qualitative feasibility study suggests that the proposed approach is simple, comprehensive and has the potential to be easily incorporated in the everyday routines of the elderly end-users.",

This has been gradually blurred and now computing devices of various types are all around us, embedded in different objects we interact with and in that way they influence our lives. There are indications that this trend is irreversible and that computing and society will now interact with each other in far richer ways than before, to the point that computing will become transparent to humans and still intrinsically involved in our daily living.

abstract="Internet connection at home has fundamentally changed the way that appliances are designed in the same way that the invention of electricity did. Having efficient and reliable home networking is the key to any modern home. The number of devices that need to be connected to a home networking system increases every day. Computers, televisions, tablets, gaming devices and sound systems are just some of the many appliances that need that connection. Despite the improvements to the hardware of networking devices, re-search shows that the software to set up networking devices along with their configuration are extremely complicated. This paper presents the results of several usability investigations on home networking devices including: a comparative study of different product brands, two series of user surveys, and empirical observations. The results of these investigations show that all of the major brands of home networking appliances use a complex, feature-oriented, rudimentary user interface (UI) design with terms that are understood by a very small percentage of people.",

abstract="Due to the ageing of the world population, a growing number of elderly people remain in their homes, requiring different levels of care. Our formative user studies show that the main concern of elderly people and their families is ``fall detection and safe movement in the house'', while eschewing intrusive monitoring devices. This paper introduces a statistical model based on non-intrusive sensor observations that posits whether a person is not safe by identifying unusually long periods of inactivity within different regions in the home. Evaluation on two real-life datasets shows that our system outperforms a state-of-the-art system.",

abstract="Whatever traveling abroad or within their's own cities, everyone aims at optimizing their route in terms of time, distance or even sightseeing. But, finding the best path in a crowded city is very challenging in terms of continuous changing traffic conditions, road maintenance state and user needs. Most people are busy with daily-basis activities, but elders tend to walk more and, therefore, they develop expertise on the traffic state and/or the presence of works going on the roads. Our driving ides is to take advantage of the knowledge that elderly can gather. For example, a tourist can go sightseeing in a new city by using an elder's advice. When decisions are based on information collected from other individual, trust management is a key problem. Also in our case, we must deal with the problem of the freshness of the elder's information and the trustworthiness of their knowledge. Our work presents a solution for this issue by proposing a new trust management in participatory sensing for path optimization using cloud based services.",

Older members of society have needs from IT which can be quite specific, reflecting their living arrangements and increased likelihood of suffering from physical and cognitive impairments. So how can businesses offering IT services understand these needs to develop products and services that this demographic group (and their carers) will be willing to adopt? In this paper we outline the process we went through to attempt to answer this question. Because our research involved elderly and (in some cases) disabled trial participants, the process had ethical considerations at the forefront, which on occasion affected the operational processes involved in bringing the trial to life.

abstract="To face new challenges caused by society aging, several researchers have initiated the experimentation of serious games as a re-education platform to help slowing down the decline of people suffering from Alzheimer. In the last few years, academic studies have been conducted and some commercial products (Nintendo's Brain Age, Big Brain Academy, etc.) have emerged. Nevertheless, these initiatives suffer from multiple important limitations since they do not really suit perceptual and interaction needs of silver-aged gamers, more specifically people suffering from Alzheimer disease. In an effort to address this important issue, we present in this paper a set of specific guidelines for designing and implementing effective serious games targeting silver-aged and Alzheimer's patients. Our guidelines cover the following aspects: (i) choosing right in-game challenges, (ii) designing appropriate interaction mechanisms for cognitively impaired people, (iii) implementing artificial intelligence for providing adequate assistive prompting and dynamic difficulty adjustments, (iv) producing effective visual and auditory assets to maximize cognitive training. Also, as a case study, we present the prototype of our new serious game for Alzheimer's patients.",

abstract="In smart home applications, accurate sensor-based human activity recognition is based on learning patterns online from collections of sequential sensor events. A more challenging problem is to discover and learn unknown activities that have not been observed or predefined. This is because in a real-world environment, it is impractical to presume that users/residents will only accomplish a set of predefined activities over a long-term period. To address the issues of classifying sequential data where there are multiple sensor-based activities which might be overlapping, we propose an Online Hidden Condition Random Field (OHCRF) using Resilient Gradient Algorithm (RGA) to recognize human activity behaviors. The discriminative nature of our OHCRF models the sequential observations of an online stream, resolving the level of biased data and over-fitting. The proposed adaptive RGA approach is used to update OHCRF's parameters for online learning. Compared with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the proposed adaptive RGA converges faster, and has an efficient and transparent adaptation process. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art methods for sequential sensor-based activity recognition involving datasets acquired from residents in smart home test-beds.",

abstract="The aging population, prevalence of chronic diseases, and outbreaks of infectious diseases are some of the major healthcare challenges. To address these unmet healthcare challenges, monitoring and Activity Recognition (AR) are considered as a subtask in pervasive computing and context-aware systems. Innumerable interdisciplinary applications exist, underpinning the obtrusive sensory data using the revolutionary digital technologies for the acquisition, transformation, and fusion of recognized activities. However, little importance is given by the research community to make the use of non-wearables i.e. unobtrusive sensing technologies. The physical state of human pervasively in daily living for AR can be seamlessly presented by acquiring health-related information by using unobtrusive sensing technologies to enable long-term health monitoring without violating an individual's privacy. This paper aims to propose and provide supervised recognition of Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) by observing unobtrusive sensor events using statistical reasoning. Furthermore, it also investigates their semantic correlations by defining semantic constraints with the support of ontological reasoning. Extensive experiments were performed with real-world dataset shared by the University of Ja{\'e}n Ambient Intelligence (UJAmI) Smart Lab in order to recognize the human activities in the smart environment. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the supervised method (87{\%}) is comparable to the one, state of the art semantic approach (91{\%}).",

A person with dementia should receive the counseling as often as possible. However, it is difficult for a limited number of caregivers to spare sufficient time and effort. This motivated us to exploit the virtual agent technology we are developing, for implementing daily dementia counseling system at home. However, our previous system relies on static dialogue scripts. Therefore, it is difficult to realize person-centered conversations that are essential to the dementia counseling. In this paper, we propose a method that dynamically generates personalized dialogues for individual people with dementia. The proposed method extensively uses life history and linked open data (LOD). More specifically, we obtain the life history of a user based on The Center Method, then the system choose appropriate conversation considering the history. During the conversation, the system finds new information in LOD relevant to the response and uses it to develop further conversation. We also implement a prototype to show practical feasibility of the proposed method.",

abstract="Robotics is both a technology and a factor that can be used to increase the interest of pupils and students in science and engineering. The project iBridge targets this issue and linked vocational schools and universities with older adults and students in order to increase their interest in innovative technology. This project is a cross-generational project that will engage the students in social and cross-cultural research topics through the application of robotics. In this paper, we introduce the project that allows students to take over the role of a co-researcher who investigate the demands and requirements of older adults towards an assistive service robot. The task of the pupils is to introduce the older adults to computer technology at a Pensioners' Club and develop a sensitive cuddly toy as a service robot within a series of workshops.",

abstract="We present a metaphor showing that blind people (users) often are living in a perplexing contexture -- a chain of barriers affecting their ability to live independently. In such a context to support users' tasks in real time, current technologies may not be intuitive enough to be used for this kind of real world application. The increasingly specialised devices and rapidly advanced assistive technologies require a composite architecture of scalable non-textual reading services. We illustrate this requirement by three user scenarios at a scale of a device, an object-awareness and a real-time situated meaningful response.",

abstract="Recent developments in wireless sensors enable a broad range of a new generation of applications, e.g., for health monitoring, environmental monitoring, smart cities, etc. However, the complexity of many signals and the need to process sensor data in real-time makes programming such applications a challenging task. This paper motivates the need to step-wise reduce the complexity of sensor data to enable application domain experts to tailor and develop (parts of) applications without having in depth programming skills. To achieve this goal, a methodology for application development with real-time sensor data processing is presented. The methodology is based on the concepts of physical and logical sensors, which can detect atomic and composite events. The combination of using the declarative approach of Complex Event Processing and modularization allows processing most data in the event space instead of signal processing. A use case for a home care application demonstrates the strength of this methodology.",

abstract="City traffic is getting more multi-modal, with a variety of actors and mobility options in mixed spaces. This makes decisions on traffic behaviour and control more complex. Beyond traditionally considered aspects (e.g. traffic state or used vehicle), human aspects (e.g. physical state, displacement goal, or companion), gain increasing relevance. They can greatly modify how people move and interact with others. Introducing social knowledge about human behaviour and context can help to better understand and anticipate the environment and its actions. This paper proposes the development of Social-Aware Driver Assistance Systems (SADASs) for that purpose. A SADAS uses traffic social properties that formalize social knowledge using a template organized around diagrams. The diagrams are compliant with a specific modelling language, which is intended to describe social aspects in a given context. They facilitate the integration of this knowledge with system specifications, and its semi-automated verification both in design and run time. A case study on a distributed obstacle detection system for vehicles extended with social knowledge to anticipate people' behaviour illustrates the approach.",

Medical systems and CDSS standards compatibility requires mediation process to ensure seamless information exchange. We propose such mediation system between medical systems and CDSS called AdapteR Interoperability ENgine (ARIEN) to achieve data level interoperability. We consider information flow from smart homes and medical systems in HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format with CDSS compliant to Virtual Medical Record (vMR) standard. The responsibility of the proposed system is transformation of smart homes and medical systems compliant standard format information into CDSS compliant standard format for processing of information and vice versa. This work achieves information exchange compatibility among systems for providing better healthcare to patients.

The adoption of MDA is still low, partly because of the general-purpose modelling language being used. Domain specific modelling languages are being developed for technological and industrial domains to improve the expressiveness and effect of model-driven development techniques. The healthcare domain could benefit from these methodologies. In order to incorporate domain knowledge in a MDA process, information about workflows, artefacts and actors can be formalized in a UML profile and applied by MDA tools for design and development. This paper presents the work done on model-driven development of smart homecare services in the MPOWER project. Following an iterative approach, two UML profiles to support development of Service Oriented Architecture based homecare applications are proposed. Using homecare specific UML profiles indicate an improvement in the process for model-driven development of homecare services.",

The use of these activity models have introduced factors which block adoption of smart home technology. To address this, goal driven smart homes have been proposed, these are based upon more flexible activity structures. However, this goal-driven approach does have a disadvantage where flexibility in this activity modeling can lead to difficulty providing illustrative guidance. To address this, a video analysis and nomination mechanism is required to provide suitable assistive clips for a given goal. This paper introduces a novel mechanism for nominating a suitable video clip given a pool of automatically generated metadata. This mechanism was then evaluated using a voice based assistant application and a tool emulating assistance requests by a goal-driven smart home. The initial evaluation produced promising results.",

Current solutions either do not consider privacy requirements or provide solutions that are mostly ad hoc and patch efforts.

abstract="At present the need for interdisciplinary education supporting development and practical application of assistive technologies (AT) is continuously growing. It is given by the development of demographic and age structure of the population and the need to ensure support and safety of elderly and handicapped people with increased health and other risks. Currently there is a lack of graduates having interdisciplinary theoretical education in the fields of electronics and information and communication technologies and simultaneously focusing on the whole complex of practical needs of applications related to assistive technologies. The same situation arises at producers of these technologies. There are very few graduates able to understand and realize complex applications as a whole. Most of the graduates are able to manage separate narrow applications without ability to interconnect them. Therefore we have decided to develop a series of courses that will fill the gap in the education. The courses will become a core of an interdisciplinary study branch in Master study and at the same time they will be offered in life long learning. The core courses cover the following topics: data sensing and transmission; sensors, actuators and control in assistive environment; circuitry and system principles of electronic devices for AT; advanced methods of data mining and knowledge discovery and their applications in AT; telecommunication equipment and systems for AT; multimedia technology; security and safety; system integration; legal, ethical and social aspects of AT. The topics are systematically and logically interconnected. The content is designed in such a way that theory, applications and system integration are represented in suitable proportion.",

abstract="One of the most challenging issues faced by many elders is the over-decreasing independence mainly caused by impaired physical, cognitive, and/or sensory abilities. Activity recognition can be used to help elders live longer in their own homes independently, by providing assurance of safety, instructing performance of activity and assessing cognitive status. In this work, we propose to discover both intra- and inter-activity association patterns from daily routines of elderly people. Specifically, a data mining method is proposed to extract the most frequent sequential sequences of steps inside each individual activity (i.e., intra-activity pattern) and activities (i.e., inter-activity pattern) of a set of daily activities. These patterns can then be used to model human daily activities for activity recognition purpose, or to directly instruct/prompt elders with impaired memory when they perform daily routines. The experimental results conducted on two individuals' datasets of daily activities show that our proposed approach is workable to discover these association patterns.",

Currently, there is a convergence combining systems for smart environments and uncertainty reasoning. Considering that the world population is aging, health-support issues are in evidence, and many dangerous situations concerning users in their living environment may arise. However, reasoning to detect situations taking into account uncertainty presents a great challenge.

abstract="Targeting at modeling the high-level dynamics of pervasive computing systems, we introduce Bond Computing Systems (BCS) consisting of objects, bonds and rules. Objects are typed but addressless representations of physical or logical (computing and communicating) entities. Bonds are typed multisets of objects. In a BCS, a configuration is specified by a multiset of bonds, called a collection. Rules specifies how a collection evolves to a new one. A BCS is a variation of a P system introduced by Gheorghe Paun where, roughly, there is no maximal parallelism but with typed and unbounded number of membranes, and hence, our model is also biologically inspired. In this paper, we focus on regular bond computing systems (RBCS), where bond types are regular, and study their computation power and verification problems. Among other results, we show that the computing power of RBCS lies between LBA (linearly bounded automata) and LBC (a form of bounded multicounter machines) and hence, the regular bond-type reachability problem (given an RBCS, whether there is some initial collection that can reach some collection containing a bond of a given regular type) is undecidable. We also study some restricted models (namely, B-boundedness and 1-transfer) of RBCS where the reachability problem becomes decidable.",

abstract="Technology is continually being implemented by construction professionals with the goal of improving construction processes and the industry's glacial pace of change. As we look to new technologies to solve existing problems, we can consider Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to make construction safer and efficient. Through this paper, we explore the ways in which AI can assist in the goal of making construction sites safe. This study proposes the development of an AI platform, which improves construction safety through hazard identification at the pre-construction stage, and suggests the applicable OSHA codes for the identified hazards, thus allowing safety standards to be implemented for compliance. Emphasis is laid on the mitigation of fall hazards, which is the leading cause of accidents in construction. Currently, project safety and risk assessment in the construction industry is carried out by professionals, who heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision making. There is a lack of a systematic approach and the ways to check the reliability of these decisions. Through the machine learning aspect of AI, we can automate the process and create an environment where potential hazards are identified before they occur with a link to the OSHA standards for recommended mitigation strategies.",

abstract="Smart homes of the future will have a number of different types of sensors. What types of sensors and how they will be used depends on the behaviour needed from the smart home. Using the sensors to automatically determine if a home is occupied can lead to a wide range of benefits. For example, it could trigger a change in the thermostat setting to save money, or even a change in security monitoring systems. Our prototype Home Occupancy Agent (HOA), which we present in this paper, uses a rule based system that monitors power consumption from meters and ambient light sensor readings in order to determine occupancy.",

abstract="The specification of agent systems comprises different dimensions normally defined using distinct formalisms. Since this lack of a uniform representation makes harder to express how each level affects the others, we propose an ontology to integrate the formalisms that originally cover a single multi-agent system dimension. In doing this, we align semantic technologies and knowledge representation for agents, environments, and organisations providing agent-oriented designers with a unified approach for developing complex systems. In our approach, we represent the abstractions typical of each multi-agent system dimension as an ontology, and we exemplify both the use of such ontologies to model an eldercare application in the context of ambient intelligence and smart cities, as well as how the ontology concepts support coding in agent platforms. We discuss the implications of such integrated view for designing agents, and highlight its advantages for agent-based software development.",

Changes in the activity patterns are detected as potential signs of changing health. A simple alert algorithm has been implemented to generate health alerts to clinicians in a senior housing facility. Clinicians analyze each alert and provide a rating on the clinical relevance. These ratings are then used as ground truth in developing classifiers. Here, we present the methodology and results for two classification approaches using embedded sensor data and health alert ratings collected on 21 seniors over nine months. The results show similar performance for the two techniques, where one approach uses only domain knowledge and the second uses supervised learning for training.",

abstract="Our research group has been studying a speech communication system with a virtual agent (VA), to support person-centered care (PCC) of people with dementia (PWD). The current system uses the 3D model based on an unreal character for the VA. Because the unfamiliar appearance is to be a mental obstacle to PWD, PWD hardly accept advice and which causes a limitation in the care effects. In this paper, we develop a novel system that dynamically creates a VA based on a given facial image of real person. The proposed system constructs a three-dimensional model based on facial landmarks within the image. It then stretches and transforms some portions of the 3D model to generate facial expressions. From just a given picture, the proposed system easily generates a communication agent familiar with individual PWD. Hence, it can implement (virtual, but effective) conversations with familiar partners. We implement the prototype based on the proposed system and conduct the experiment targeting to the elderly.",

abstract="Those with dementia need closer attention and monitoring when they develop incontinence. Incontinence can lead to medical complications such as skin breakdown, places greater demands on caregivers, and strips the patients of their dignity. We have taken a step towards building a smart continence management system (SCMS) by automating the detection of events and forwarding details of these events to caregivers. Besides reducing bedsores and concomitant ill-effects of the elderly remaining in soiled diapers for prolonged periods, SCMS also benefits caregivers, helping them improve visitation schedules and time management. In the user-requirements generation phase, a cohort of people were interviewed. Subsequently the user-requirements were translated into technical specifications, based on which, a product survey was conducted. The system was designed, implemented, deployed and is being evaluated at a nursing home in Singapore. Initial results are encouraging. A planned usability study/overall system evaluation will provide new requirements for the second version.",

This paper presents a system for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) capable of understanding context and user's behavior by exploiting data gathered by a pervasive sensor network. The knowledge inferred by adopting a Bayesian knowledge extraction approach is exploited to disambiguate the collected observations, making the AAL system able to detect and predict anomalies in user's behavior or health condition, in order to send appropriate alerts to family members and caregivers. Experimental results performed on a simulated smart home prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

This requires that patients autonomously follow their prescribed treatment, which can be especially difficult for patients suffering some kind of cognitive impairment. Information technologies show potential for supporting medication adherence but the main challenge is the distributed and highly regulated nature of this scenario, where there are several tasks involving the coordinated action of a range of actors. In this paper we propose to use socially intelligent systems to tackle this challenge. These systems exhibit, understand, and reason about social behaviour, in order to support people in their daily lives. Such systems present an opportunity when applied to information technologies for supporting treatment adherence. We explore how concepts of socially intelligent systems, including social practices and social identities, can be applied to AVICENA, an ongoing project to create a platform for assisting patients in several daily tasks related to their healthcare. We first introduce AVICENA, briefly describe our previous attempts to model the system from an organizational perspective and an institutional one and discuss some of the limitations found in those models. Then the core concepts of socially intelligent systems are introduced and we show how they can be applied to create a socially aware framework for supporting medication adherence.",

abstract="In recent years, the research on the anomaly detection has been rapidly increasing. The researchers were worked on different anomalies in videos. This work focuses on fall as an anomaly as it is an emerging research topic with application in elderly safety areas including home environment. The older population staying alone at home is prone to various accidental events including falls which may lead to multiple harmful consequences even death. Thus, it is imperative to develop a robust solution to avoid this problem. This can be done with the help of video surveillance along with computer vision. In this paper, a simple yet efficient technique to detect fall with the help of inexpensive depth camera was presented. Frame differencing method was applied for background subtraction. Various features including orientation angle, aspect ratio, silhouette features, and motion history image (MHI) were extracted for fall characterization. The training and testing were successfully implemented using SVM and SGD classifiers. It was observed that SGD classifier gives better fall detection accuracy than the SVM classifier in both training and testing phase for SDU fall dataset.",

abstract="In this study, we evaluate the use of height for biometric identification of residents, by mounting ultrasonic distance sensors above the doorways in a home. Height sensors are cheap, are convenient for the residents, are simple to install in an existing home, and are perceived to be less invasive than cameras or microphones. Height is typically only a weak biometric, but we show that it is well suited for identifying among a few residents in the home, and can potentially be improved by using the history of height measurements at multiple doorways in a tracking approach. We evaluate this approach using 20 people in a controlled laboratory environment and by installing in 3 natural, home environments. We combine these results with public anthropometric data sets that contain the heights of residents in 2077 elderly multi-resident homes to conclude that height sensors could potentially achieve at least 95{\%} identification accuracy in 95{\%} of elderly homes in the US.",

abstract="The demographic change has tremendous consequences for health care availability, with a growing mismatch between rising numbers of patients and the declining number of care personnel. As a consequence, considerable shortcomings in availability, accessibility, and quality of health care can be expected. Telemedicine and telemonitoring services are promising approaches to compensate this gap, especially for long-term monitoring, nevertheless also within the supply chain of health care. Despite the potential, the acceptance of telemedicine is quite low. In this paper we report on two studies focusing on acceptance of telemedical services. First, chronically ill persons were experimentally studied with respect to their acceptance of telemedical systems. Second, a survey was conducted to assess medical professionals' points of view. Findings reveal perceived benefits in the context of telemedical services, however, also considerable barriers, especially on the medical doctors' side. Outcomes may contribute to the development of a sensitive and transparent communication and information strategy for stakeholders, as well as a public awareness for the benefits and the drawbacks of telemedical services.",

In this paper, we present some of the lessons learnt from the first interaction between the robot and two elderly people from one partner care facility (LACE Housing Ltd, UK). The robot interacted with the two participants for almost one hour. A tremendous amount of sensory data was recorded from the multi-sensory system (i.e., audio data, RGB-D data, thermal images, and the data from the skeleton tracker) for better understanding the interaction, the needs, the reactions of the users, and the context. This data was processed offline. Before the interaction between the two elderly residents and the robot, a demo was shown to all the residents of the facility. The reactions of the residents were positive and they found the robot useful. The first lessons learnt from this interaction between Kompa{\"i} robot and the elderly are reported.",

However, a lack of empirical knowledge of performing safety assurance techniques, especially safety analysis in a real agile project hampers further steps. Aims: In this article, we aim at (1) understanding and optimizing the S-Scrum development process, a Scrum extension with the integration of a systems theory based safety analysis technique, STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis), for safety-critical systems; (2) validating the Optimized S-Scrum development process further. Method: We conducted a two-stage exploratory case study in a student project at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Results: The results in stage 1 showed that S-Scrum helps to ensure safety of each release but is less agile than the normal Scrum. We explored six challenges on: priority management; communication; time pressure on determining safety requirements; safety planning; time to perform upfront planning; and safety requirements' acceptance criteria. During stage 2, the safety and agility have been improved after the optimizations, including an internal and an external safety expert; pre-planning meeting; regular safety meeting; an agile safety plan; and improved safety epics and safety stories. We have also gained valuable suggestions from industry, but the generalization problem due to the specific context is still unsolved.",

DR mechanisms are capable of controlling the user energy consumption according to load conditions and providing effective energy management. However, they are typically performed regardless of user's situation and current activities. Factoring in the user's contextual information which is relevant to their current or future energy consumption can significantly increase the effectiveness of DR programs and enable adaptive and personalized execution of DR control actions. In this paper, we review current DR techniques and discuss the state-of-the-art smart energy management approaches that take into account contextual information. An overview of context reasoning and learning techniques for smart homes are presented to demonstrate how knowledge of user activities can be utilized in context-aware DR mechanisms. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of DR programs and highlight the importance of the context-awareness in improving smart energy management.",

abstract="The availability of diverse embedded sensors in modern smartphones has created exciting opportunities for developing context-aware services and applications, such as Human activity recognition (HAR) in healthcare and smart buildings. However, recognizing human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data mining approaches due to the limited resources of the device. For example, the training process is usually performed offline but rarely online on the mobile device itself, because traditional batch learning usually needs a large dataset of many users. Therefore, building models using complex multiclass algorithms is generally very time-consuming. In this paper, we present a comparison study using two approaches in order to reduce training time and memory usage while maintaining significant performance. In the first approach, we conducted experiments using batch learning on a GPU platform. Results showed that High Performance Extreme Learning Machine (HPELM) offers the best compromise: accuracy, memory usage and training time. Moreover, it achieved better performance on two dynamic activities, outperforming the best SVM model obtained in our previous study. In the second approach, we conducted experiments using online stream learning on the MOA platform. Unlike the first approach, experiments were performed using accelerometer data only. We also studied the effects of user/device dependency and feature engineering on the classification performance and memory usage by comparing five constructed real data streams. Simulation results showed that Hoeffding Adaptive Tree has comparable performance to batch learning, especially for user and device dependent data streams.",

The elderly, especially when suffering from dementia, are not able to react to emergency situations properly, thus falls need to be detected automatically. An overview of different classes of fall detection approaches is presented and a vision-based approach is introduced. We propose the use of a Kinect to obtain 3D data in combination with fuzzy logic for robust fall detection and show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms. Our approach is evaluated on 72 video sequences, containing 40 falls and 32 activities of daily living.",

To ensure that information transmitted by these sensing devices are of a high quality, the data needs to be processed, validated and verified to meet the data quality requirements of the end user. The sensor validation component of the Data Management System (DMS) architecture is presented. It is designed to identify if the real-time sensor is functioning within the correct operating bounds. The DMS is applied within a medical environment to assess its ability to manage real-time patient sensor readings. The effectiveness of the DMS-Validation Model (DMS-VM) is evaluated under two real world scenarios 1) Hardware variance among four Tyndall-DMS-Motes with a patient state of resting and 2) One Tyndall-DMS-Mote under three patient states. The experiments have shown the reliability of the Tyndall-DMS-Mote and the ability of the DMS-VM to ensure sensor data quality. Validating sensor reliability is essential to enable safe remote health monitoring in the home.",

abstract="One application of smart homes is to take sensor activations from a variety of sensors around the house and use them to recognise the particular behaviours of the inhabitants. This can be useful for monitoring of the elderly or cognitively impaired, amongst other applications. Since the behaviours themselves are not directly observed, only the observations by sensors, it is common to build a probabilistic model of how behaviours arise from these observations, for example in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In this paper we present a method of selecting which of a set of trained HMMs best matches the current observations, together with experiments showing that it can reliably detect and segment the sensor stream into behaviours. We demonstrate our algorithm on real sensor data obtained from the MIT PlaceLab. The results show a significant improvement in the recognition accuracy over other approaches.",

abstract="We discuss an integrated approach towards building systems for monitoring and assisting people with mild dementia in their homes. Our approach differs from existing approaches in three ways. First we improve context acquisition and understanding with the concept of micro-context that takes us beyond existing notions of location and temporal context; second, we incorporate plasticity concept into the human computer interface, in order to provide a natural interaction way and accommodative interface to the user; third we target robust and reliable systems that are easy to scale and deploy in diverse end-user settings, through the use of formal model building tools to specify and verify systems at key stages from requirements generation all the way to deployment and user statistics gathering. In order to address real-life end user requirements we are working closely with geriatric doctors and their staff, so as to get inputs as to precise challenges in caring for mild dementia patients, and how systems targeted at holistic, personalized assistance and care-giving can be built with a view towards scaled up deployment in diverse settings. The main contribution of this paper is an approach for system building that incorporates activity monitoring, user interface plasticity and scenario verification targeting people with cognitive decline in regards to a Singapore initiative called A-Star Home 2015 Phase II. We expect our work to lead to a methodology for systematic development of monitoring and assistive systems for cognitive interventions for mild dementia patients at home. Although the integrated framework is still not completely realized, the three areas mentioned above have each yielded significant results on their own, and these are mentioned in the paper.",

abstract="While worldwide several health and wellbeing products and services are being developed to support people to live comfortable and independently in their home environment, widespread adoption of these smart living solutions is still not envisioned. A hindering factor is that users are not aware of possible solutions or where to find them, which could be solved through promoting solutions on shared platforms. Designing such platforms is challenging as multiple stakeholders need to be satisfied and start-up problems need to be overcome. Most theory on platforms is explored in ex-post studies and there is a lack of knowledge on how platforms should be designed and implemented. In this paper, we elicit functional requirements for the design of a multi-sided health and wellbeing platform based on interviews with both end-users and stakeholders. These requirements provide the basis for future design cycles in which, the development and actual implementation of a platform is foreseen.",

Among the target groups of people, elderly are a population eager for ``choices for living arrangements'', which would allow them to continue living in their homes but at the same time provide the health care they need. Given the growing elderly population, there is a need for statistical models able to capture the recurring patterns of daily activity life and reason based on this information. We present an analysis of real-life sensor data collected from 40 different households of elderly people, using motion, door and pressure sensors. Our objective is to automatically observe and model the daily behavior of the elderly and detect anomalies that could occur in the sensor data. For this purpose, we first introduce an abstraction layer to create a common ground for home sensor configurations. Next, we build a probabilistic spatio-temporal model to summarize daily behavior. Anomalies are then defined as significant changes from the learned behavioral model and detected using a cross-entropy measure. We have compared the detected anomalies with manually collected annotations and the results show that the presented approach is able to detect significant behavioral changes of the elderly.",

abstract="The improvement of the conditions of daily life at home and work, promoted by the socio-economic progression, best quality private living environments and the immense development in healthcare and biomedical technologies has extended the average age of life beyond 70. According to recent surveys this ``population aging'' phenomenon will contribute to reach the record number of 1 billion people over 60 years on earth by the year 2020. Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents a remote home monitoring application called Living Assistant that could be utilized to continuously monitor and control a wide range of electronic appliances and ambient parameters. Basically it has been designed to function as a healthcare aide for elderly patients suffering from restricted mobility or other chronic diseases. The advanced ways of user interfaces presented in this paper are simple, generic and universally applicable. With little customization the application can be used to accommodate other user groups as well.",

abstract="Pervasive sensors in the home have a variety of applications including energy minimization, activity monitoring for elders, and tutors for household tasks such as cooking. Many of the common sensors today are binary, e.g. IR motion sensors, door close sensors, and floor pressure pads. Predicting user behavior is one of the key enablers for applications. While we consider smart home data here, the general problem is one of predicting discrete human actions. Drawing on Activity Theory, the language as action principle, and speech understanding research, we argue that smoothed n-grams are very appropriate for this task. We built such a model and applied it to data gathered from 3 smart home installations. The data showed a classic Zipf or power-law distribution, similar to speech and language. We found that the predictive accuracy of the n-gram model ranges from 51{\%} to 39{\%}, which is significantly above the baseline for the deployments of 16, 76 and 70 sensors. While we cannot directly compare this result with other work (lack of shared data), by examination of high entropy zones in the datasets (e.g. the kitchen triangle) we argue that accuracies around 50{\%} are best possible for this task.",

Although a lot of work has been done to recognize elderly people's activities of daily life (ADL), few systems have investigated if the location information can be deployed to improve the ADL recognition accuracy. In this paper, we intend to incorporate the location information in the activity recognition algorithm and see if it can help to improve the recognition accuracy. We propose two ways to bring the location information into the picture: one way is to bring location in the feature level, the other way is to utilize it to filter irrelevant sensor readings.

abstract="Currently, the trust in V2X-technology is naturally expected. To share private data with novel technologies is not a new phenomenon today, but data security and privacy are worldwide topics, which are constantly gaining importance. Therefore, the present paper will show influential user factors for technology acceptance and the willingness to share data like prior experience with driver assistance systems. Also technical affinity and frequency of car usage are investigated user requirements. By focusing different traffic scenarios, results show also an undeniable reluctance towards sharing private data with other traffic participants or companies. Traffic management such as police or the infrastructure itself are however entrusted with various personal information and data. Further, it was possible to identify different user profiles in data sharing behavior.",

abstract="Activity- and context-aware systems, as they are known, established, and well evaluated in small-scale laboratory settings for years and decades, suffer from the fact, that they are limited concerning the underlying data delivering entities. The sensor systems are usually attached on the body, on objects, or in the environment, directly surrounding persons or groups whose activities or contextual information has to be detected. For sensors that are exploited in this kind of systems, it is essential that their modalities, positions and technical details are initially defined to ensure a stable and accurate system execution. In contrast to that, opportunistic sensing allows for selecting and utilizing sensors, as they happen to be accessible according to their spontaneous availability, without presumably defining the input modalities, on a goal-oriented principle. One major benefit thereby is the capability of utilizing sensors of different kinds and modalities, even immaterial sources of information like webservices, by abstracting low-level access details. This emerges the need to roll out the data federating entity as decentralized collecting point. Cloud-based technologies enable space- and time-free utilization of a vast amount of heterogeneous sensor devices reaching from simple physical devices (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, as they are conventionally included on today's smart phones) to social media sensors, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This paper presents an opportunistic, cloud-based approach for large-scale activity- and context-recognition.",

A smart environment should be able to respond in case of emergency or risk and inform any abnormal behavior. Still, not much research is done to understand behavior patterns, temporal changes and other particularities that can affect the effectiveness of smart environments in ambient assisted living. We explored the behavior of two adults in a smart environment in order to reveal temporal, spatial and sequential relations among the activities as well as the changes that these relations undergo overtime and across individuals.

abstract="Elderly with declining cognitive functions, their family members and assistive care providers have all identified good ``quality of life'' as a central element in living with diseases such as dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Quality of life concerns mood, sleep, daily activities performance, pleasant engagements, physical mobility and healthy lifestyle. Sleep quality is essential for the human being to maintain good physical and emotional health. And sleep disorders can lead to severe physical and emotional effects, e.g. cognitive decline and mental health complications. So being able to measure and evaluate sleep quality and monitor mood is inseparably linked to every assistive living system. Sensor-based sleep and mood monitoring systems promise to prolong independent living of elderly people with declining physical and cognitive functions. In this paper, an implementation of sleep and mood monitoring and estimation of intelligent modules part of Ambient Assisted Living architecture is presented. A web application displays the computational results by providing information and recommendations on how to improve sleep hygiene to caregivers and coaches the elderly into a healthy sleeping behavior, based on their personal rhythm and health problems.",

abstract="Although eHealth technologies offer an enormous potential to improve healthcare, the knowledge about key determinants of acceptance for eHealth technology is restricted. While the underlying technology of eHealth technologies and Information and Communication technology (ICT) is quite similar, utilization contexts and using motives are quite different. In order to explore the role of technology type on acceptance, we contrasted central application characteristics of both technology types using the scenario technique. A questionnaire was administered (n = 104) measuring individual variables (age, gender) and attitudes regarding an eHealth application (blood sugar meter) in contrast to an ICT device (Personal Digital Assistant, PDA). Older users basically approved the utilization of health-related technologies and perceived lower usability barriers. In addition, we identified main utilization motives of eHealth technology and technology-specific acceptance patterns, especially regarding issues of data safety in the eHealth context. Effects of age and gender in acceptance ratings suggest a differential perspective on eHealth acceptance. Finally, practical interventions were derived in order to support eHealth device design and to promote acceptance of eHealth technology.",

abstract="User guidance systems are relevant to various applications of the service robotics field, among which: smart GPS navigator, robotic guides for museum or shopping malls or robotic wheel chairs for disabled persons. Such a system aims at helping its user to reach its destination in a fairly complex environment. If we assume the system is used in a fixed environment by multiple users for multiple navigation task over the course of days or weeks, then it is possible to take advantage of the user routine: from the initial navigational choice, users can be identified and their goal can be predicted. As a result of these prediction, the guidance system can bring its user to its destination while requiring less interaction. This property is particularly relevant for assisting disabled person for whom interaction is a long and complex task. In this paper, we implement a user guidance system using a dynamic Bayesian model and a topological representation of the environment. This model is evaluated with respect to the quality of its action prediction in a scenario involving 4 human users, and it is shown that in addition to the user identity, the goals and actions of the user are accurately predicted.",

abstract="This paper investigates the multiple dimensions of patient satisfaction measured by the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey in the United States. The analysis reveals that even the highest rating hospitals do not excel on all dimensions of satisfaction. While satisfaction levels with nurse and doctor communication are high, satisfaction levels with discharge information and explanation of medications could be significantly improved. In addition, low rating hospitals seem to be doing better than the high rating hospitals on these critical dimensions for the quality of care. The paper also investigates how hospital structural characteristics captured in the American Hospital Association (AHA) survey affect different dimensions of patient satisfaction. The analysis reveals that these structural factors may have differential effects, i.e. the type of hospitals (e.g., teaching vs. non-teaching) has a relatively small effect on the hospital room environment than on communication and responsiveness. The results suggest that considering all patient satisfaction dimensions helps provide a more accurate picture of the care received by patients, makes it possible to pinpoint specific areas where hospitals are deficient that are not reflected in the overall satisfaction scores, and assists hospital management to design actionable strategies for improvement.",

abstract="Combining ongoing Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technological developments (e.g. pervasive computing, wearable devices, sensor networks etc.) with user-centred design methods greatly increases the acceptance of the intelligent system and makes it more capable of providing a better quality of life in a non-intrusive way. Elderly people could clearly benefit from this concept. Thanks to smart environments, they can experience considerable enhancements, giving them an opportunity to live more independently and for longer in their home rather than in a health-care centre. However, to implement such a system, it is essential to know for whom we are designing. In this paper, we present an intelligent system with a monitoring infrastructure that will help mainly elderly users with impairments to overcome their handicap. The purpose of such a system is to create a safe and intuitive environment that will facilitate the achievement of household tasks in order to preserve independence of elderly residents for a while longer. Pursuing this goal, we propose to use the persona concept to help us build a user model based on the personas' aptitudes. The practice of user modelling emphasizes the importance of user-centred techniques in any AmI system development and highlights the potential impacts of AmI for certain targeted groups - in this case, the elderly and people with disabilities.",

abstract="This study conducted a driving simulation experiment using an aural, visual, or multi-modality in-vehicle information system (IVIS) to investigate the performance and emergency response of 24 younger (age: M = 23.10 years, SD = 1.54) and 24 older (age: M = 69.21 years, SD = 3.05) drivers in simple and complex road conditions. All drivers assisted by aural or multi-modality IVIS made significantly fewer errors in response to hazard warnings than those who were assisted by the visual modality system. Specifically, drivers exhibited improved performance for response time and the total number of correct turns in complex driving conditions when using multi- or aural modality IVIS; this effect is particularly salient for older drivers. The IVIS improved the safety of older drivers more than that of their younger counterparts, despite their poor vehicle control and slow response time in hazard situations.",

abstract="Today, data collected in smart-living environments are constantly increasing in the dimensions of volume, velocity and variety, which characterize any big data application. In such a way, it makes sense to investigate big data analytics for elderly monitoring at home. The aim of this study is to conduct a preliminary investigation of state-of-the-art algorithms for abnormal activity detection and change prediction, suitable to deal with big data. The algorithmic approaches, under evaluation and comparison, belong to the three main categories of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques. At this purpose, specific synthetic data are generated, including activities of daily living, home locations in which such activities take place, as well as physiological parameters. All techniques are evaluated in terms of abnormality-detection accuracy and lead-time of prediction, using the generated datasets with various kinds of perturbation. The achieved results, even though preliminary, are very encouraging, showing that unsupervised deep-learning techniques outperform traditional (machine learning) ones, with detection accuracy greater than 96{\%} and prediction lead-time of about 15 days in advance.",

abstract="Service-Oriented Architecture is widely used to program pervasive spaces such as Smart Homes because of its capabilities to handle dynamic and heterogeneous environments. It is often the case that the services required are designed and implemented using different SOAs, such as OSGi and Web Services. Most of the current composition frameworks take a two-tier approach: those services following the same SOA can take advantage of service composition and runtime substitutions, while interactions between services of different SOAs require hardcoded service invocations that do not really provide full advantage of SOA. Some SOAs do not support features such as on-the-fly compositions or a searchable service directory. In this paper, we present a framework to compose and orchestrate services from different SOA implementations and provide the missing functionalities to support composition of heterogeneous SOAs. We present a case study and the performance analysis of the study to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework.",

abstract="Assisted Living Systems with Ambient Intelligence technology raise new challenges to system and software engineering. The development of Assisted Living applications requires domain-oriented interdisciplinary research -- it is essential to know both the domain and the context. It is also important that context-descriptive prototypes are: (1) an integrated description that describes system, work processes, context of use; and (2) a formal description. Because (1), designers, including end users, are provided with a means to investigate the system in the context of the envisioned work processes. Because (2), investigations into questions of formalization and automation, not only of the system, but also of the work processes, can be made explicitly and become subject for discussions and further elaboration. Adapted engineering approaches are required to cope with the specific characteristics of ambient intelligent systems. Elderly are the most demanding stakeholders for IT-development -- even highly sophisticated systems will not be accepted when they do not address the real needs of the elderly and are not easily accessible and usable. Communication processes are essential in that respect. The evolution and, in particular, the spread of unambiguous symbols were an necessary postulate for the transfer of information, as for example in sign language, speech, writing, etc. In this paper, we report on our experiences in design, development and evaluation of computer applications in the area of ambient assisted living for elderly people, where, to our experiences, engineers highly underestimate the power of appropriate knowledge on semiotics and we demonstrate how we can emphasize universal access by thinking of informatics as semiotics engineering.",

In this study we investigate a device free method to detect falls by using simple batteryless radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in a smart RFID enabled carpet. Our method extracts information from the tags and the environment of the carpeted floor and applies machine learning techniques to make an autonomous decision regarding the posture of a person on the floor. This information can be used to automatically seek assistance to help the subject and decrease the negative effects of `long-lie' after a fall. Our approach does not require video monitoring or body worn kinematic sensors; hence preserves the privacy of the dwellers, reduces costs and eliminates the need to remember to wear a device. Our results indicate a good performance for fall detection with an overall F-score of 94{\%}.",

abstract="Despite their crucial goal of assisting the elderly through their daily routine, Independent Living Support systems still are at their inception. This paper postulates that such systems be designed with a number of requirements in mind, and in particular with safety, security and privacy as fundamental ones. It then correspondingly articulates the three main challenges behind the development of Independent Living Support systems: requirement elicitation, design and correctness analysis. It is found that requirement elicitation will have to cope with a large variety of issues; that design will have to proceed from modularity; and, notably, that correctness analysis will have to be socio-technical. The last finding in particular emphasises that, for a system that prescribes vast interaction with the human, system correctness only makes sense if the system is analysed in combination with the human, rather than in isolation from the human. Building upon previous experience with the socio-technical analysis of Internet browsers, this paper identifies the specific socio-technical challenges that Independent Living Support systems pose, and indicates an approach to succeed in taking them.",

Methods and techniques from the Artificial Intelligence field offer a broad range of ideas and points of view for solving the problem. In particular, information systems and intelligent agents are two perspectives that deserve further study. Information systems provide a formal knowledge representation that models important tasks such as concept description and decision making. On the other hand, intelligent agents provide a mechanism to implement a rational behavior. The combination of both perspectives offers a valid solution to our problems.",

abstract="Falls in the elderly is a major public health problem because of their frequency and their medical and social consequences. New smart assistive technologies and Health Telematics make it possible to provide elderly with more security and well being at home. A smart home can automatically monitor home activities for early warning in health changes or detecting dangerous situations. One of our objectives is to design an automatic system to detect fall at home, which in its final version will be made up of a network of RGB-D sensors. In this paper, we present a simple and robust method based on the identification and tracking of the center of mass of people evolving in an indoor environment. Using a simple Hidden Markov Model whose observations are the position of the center of mass, its velocity and the general shape of the body, we can surprisingly monitor the activity of a person with high accuracy and thus detect falls with very good accuracy without false positives. An experimental study, that is reported here, has been driven in our smart apartment lab. 26 subjects were asked to perform a predefined scenario in which they realized a set of eight postures. 2 hours of video (216 000 frames) were recorded for the evaluation, half of it being used for the training of the model. The system detected the falls without false positives. This result encourages us to use this system in real situation for a better study of its efficiency.",

abstract="Whereas mobile devices have been heavily investigated as remote controls for distant displays, research on the fundamental first step, the pairing with the display, is scarce. In a comparative user study with 31 participants we evaluated five potential pairing techniques concerning their performance and acceptance for connecting to a public display and gained insights into the general requirements for pairing techniques in this special usage context. Besides four established mobile interaction techniques (touching an NFC tag, capturing a QR code, scanning, and manual input), our study considered a recent appropriate pairing technique called display pointing, which allows passers-by to connect to available displays just by pointing their smartphone at the installation, for the first time. Our results show that display pointing is superior to traditional alternatives to a large extent. Yet, its quick response times can result in a perceived lack of control if not handled appropriately. Further, we learnt that long distance techniques are generally preferred while the type of device gesture as well as security concerns are of less relevance.",

abstract="Based on GPS/Beidou technologies, dynamic safety supervision of commercial operating vehicles has played an important role in transportation industry safety. From the serious traffic accidents occurred in recent years, the major reasons were the improper safety supervision of vehicles. The traditional dynamic safety supervision mode and applications are insufficient. To make up for the lack of traditional dynamic supervision and realize the traceability and visualization of the supervision process, it is necessary to innovate the road transportation safety monitoring, with new management concepts and technologies. Based on the practical understanding of the traditional monitoring status of the industry, this paper proposes the third-party safety supervision of commercial vehicles. We successfully incorporate the application of third parties in other fields world widely and combine it with the development of vehicle dynamic monitoring technology. Through the innovative application of empirical applications in certain areas, the government bureau, enterprises, and monitoring operators all recognized the new model. The overall safety level indicators and accident data before and after the application are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the new model has largely improved the safety level of transportation within the region. At the same time, it has broadened the scale of supervision, practically reducing the corporate costs and operating investment. The new model greatly improves the dynamic security monitoring effect, which satisfies all parties' demands without increasing the input. At present, this model has been promoted and applied in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was proved to have important social and economic significance for modern transportation industries.",

abstract="Ensuring ethical value exchange is moving to the forefront of the global challenges that HCI will have to address in the coming years. In this position paper, we argue that applying a context-sensitive, sociotechnical approach to HCI can help meet the challenge. The background is that the life of marginalized people in contemporary society is challenging and uncertain. The marginalized can face health and cognitive issues as well as a lack of stability of social structures such as family, work and social inclusion. Three questions are of concern when innovating together with people `at the margins': how can we describe users without attempting to stereotype badly, what sociotechnical HCI methods fit the local societal context, and how to make the design sustainable in face of current planetary challenges (e.g., climate change)? We adapt the sociotechnical HCI approach called human work interaction design (HWID) to meet the challenges of designing for ethical value exchange. We present three cases of service design, and suggest how to add a fourth similar case using the HWID approach during a field trip and workshop at the INTERACT 2017 conference in Mumbai. We conclude that applying a context sensitive sociotechnical HCI framework implies that both the backend and frontend of service design and product innovations should be executed and valorized from within the local context.",

abstract="Recognition of Activities of Daily Living is a problem that is still not yet solved. In addition, it is important to realise that a neat solution can support healthcare systems to meet increasing population and ageing. Near existing fall detection solutions, a monitoring system of person's daily activities will provide a lot of opportunities. For instance, doctors and caretakers will spend more time for patients who truly need them and the patient, in its turn, will receive recommendations in order to prevent disease development and progression. This paper presents a novel user-centric approach proposed and researched by the first author in the context of his Master thesis. The initial idea was to push off from the indoor localisation technique as it might improve recognition of person's activities significantly. The experiments using Bluetooth beacons and a smartwatch demonstrated good results and a lot of potential.",

This paper presents an innovative way of data management based on a middleware platform providing services for fast and easy creation of applications dealing with the problems of taking care of patients in their homes. The work was carried out as a part of the MPOWER project, funded by the EU 6th Framework Programme, and carried out by a multinational development team. The project focuses on supporting activities of daily living and provides services for elderly and cognitive disabled, e.g. people with dementia. The MPOWER platform is designed to facilitate rapid development of a variety of applications and adopt them to specific users' needs. The paper introduces the whole platform, its functionality and principal goals along with the architectural background of data management, focusing on the different types of data that the system has to manage and analyze.

A previously reported fall detection method using the Microsoft Kinect was used to detect naturally occurring falls in the main living area of each apartment. In this paper, evaluation results are included for 12 apartments over a 101 day period in which 34 naturally occurring falls were detected. Based on computed fall confidences, real-time alerts were sent via email to facility staff. The alerts contained an embedded hyperlink to a short depth video clip of the suspected fall. Recipients were able to click on the hyperlink to view the clip on any device supporting play back of MPEG-4 video, such as smart phones, to immediately determine if the alert was for an actual fall or a false alarm. Benefits and limitations of the technology are discussed.",

abstract="Methods from the area of Process Mining traditionally focus on extracting insight in business processes from event logs. In this paper we explore the potential of Process Mining to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. Events in smart home environments are recorded at the level of sensor triggers, which is too low to mine habit-related behavioral patterns. Process discovery algorithms produce then overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework to automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level. Our framework is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. We use supervised learning techniques to train it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction improve on precision as well as on F-score.",

The notion of smart dust summarizes ubiquitous computing and sensing application systems, which can serve for local as well as global information acquisition and decision making. For off-the-shelf-nodes, and even more for dedicated physical designs, the system design process becomes increasingly challenging and potentially intractable. Automated design methods emerging for intelligent systems are introduced as a remedy. These considerations will be extended to variations, that multiple system instances have to face in real-world applications and potential compensation by incorporation of self-x properties. These concepts are elucidated for the case of reconfigurable and evolvable sensor electronics. Finally, an application perspective of the presented approach for integrated distributed sensing in home automation, assisted living, and in particular, smart kitchen applications, denoted as culinary assistance systems will be presented.",

abstract="Accelerometers are become ubiquitous and available in several devices such as smartphones, smartwaches, fitness trackers, and wearable devices. Accelerometers are increasingly used to monitor human activities of daily living in different contexts such as monitoring activities of persons with cognitive deficits in smart homes, and monitoring physical and fitness activities. Activity recognition is the most important core component in monitoring applications. Activity recognition algorithms require substantial amount of labeled data to produce satisfactory results under diverse circumstances. Several methods have been proposed for activity recognition from accelerometer data. However, very little work has been done on identifying connections and relationships between existing labeled datasets to perform transfer learning for new datasets. In this paper, we investigate deep learning based transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that takes advantage of learned representations of activities of daily living from one dataset to recognize these activities in different other datasets characterized by different features including sensor modality, sampling rate, activity duration and environment. We experimentally validated our proposed algorithm on several existing datasets and demonstrated its performance and suitability for activity recognition.",

In this paper, the successful capture of the relationships between physiological and activity profile information is presented. Experiments have been designed to collect ECG data during the completion of five predefined everyday activities using wearable wireless sensors. The impact of these activities on heart rate has been captured through the analysis of changes in heart rate patterns.

Nowadays, using logical rules to infer knowledge, express restrictions and so on has shown a great interest in several domains which makes rule-based systems very popular. However, since rules may originate from heterogeneous sources and change over time, methods are required to maintain rules consistency by detecting and resolving the conflicts. The method we put forward in this work refines a form of non-monotonic reasoning called argumentation with new definitions.

The feature for judging fall, namely the angle between leg and horizontal plane, is proposed in this study. The experimental data is based on the simulated fall videos took from Leqiao station of Soochow 1st metro line in Jiangsu province. Our results show that, the single picture and video are tested respectively, and it is found that the timing information is more fault-tolerant and more accurate in identifying falls, yet is more complex and more difficult to implement.

Also, more useful and efficient detection characteristics can be taken into account in the future.",

abstract="Understanding what the user is doing in a Smart Environment is important not only for adapting the environment behavior, e.g. by providing the most appropriate combination of services for the recognized situation, but also for identifying situations that could be problematic for the user. Manually building models of the user processes is a complex, costly and error-prone engineering task. Hence, the interest in automatically learning them from examples of actual procedures. Incremental adaptation of the models, and the ability to express/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks, are also desirable. First-order logic provides a single comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all of the above. This paper presents a First-Order Logic incremental method for inferring process models, and show its application to the user's daily routines, for predicting his needs and comparing the actual situation with the expected one. Promising results have been obtained with both controlled experiments that proved its efficiency and effectiveness, and with a domain-specific dataset.",

abstract="Home care systems need to be personalised to meet individual needs, and must be easily adjusted as the user's symptoms develop. Care policies (i.e. Event-Condition-Action rules) can be used to specify care services, facilitating changes in the behaviour of a home care system. Context modelling allows a user to specify the trigger and conditions of a care policy, using high-level context rather than raw sensor data. The actions of a care policy are, however, still dependent on the implementations details of actuators. We propose a framework that allows the actions of a care policy to be specified abstractly using human-understandable concepts. The framework takes care of discovering and using specific actuators, hiding the low-level home networking details from ordinary users. It therefore makes personalisation and modification of home care systems more accessible to ordinary users, requiring very little technical knowledge.",

Novel human-computer interaction systems and techniques are required to fill the gap between elderly reduced physical and cognitive capabilities and the smooth usage of technological artefacts densely populating our environments.

In this paper, we propose a personalized hand pose and gesture recognition system (called HANDY) supporting personalized gestures and we report the results of two experiments with both younger and older participants. Our results show that by sufficiently training our system we can get similar accuracies for both younger and older users. This means that our gesture recognition system can accommodate the limitations of an ageing-hand even in presence of hand issues like arthritis or hand tremor.",

Due to target population specifications, eServices was designed to be as simple and accessible as possible in order to remove technological barriers. One of eServices major features is to detect imminent danger situations, act accordingly. It also collects the data from the sensors, location routines and from the interactions between the elderlies and the provided services to detect behavior deviations in order to act preventively. The platform was tested by seniors in real scenario. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed platform was well accepted and easy to use by seniors, which demonstrated enthusiasm and interest in daily bases use.",

Acceptability is not only related to human factors such as button size and legibility, but rather relates to perceived value and harmony in relation to existing living patterns. This paper describes the design of an asynchronous interactive communication system based upon a bulletin board metaphor. A panel of end-users was involved in various stages of the design process. To improve ease of use, functionality exposed to elderly users is limited, while caregivers are given extended control. A pilot field study with a working prototype showed a high degree of user acceptance. The user centered approach resulted in a design concept that was acceptable for the elderly participants.",

This combination of methods revealed a range of user values, behaviours, coping styles, and requirements for ubiquitous technology that would otherwise have been difficult to gather in this domain of ubiquitous, `invisible' computing.",

The elderly face a number of needs and problems which must be resolved in order to maintain such quality of life. Some of these problems are related to muscle weakness, a lack of accuracy in sensory information or loss of equilibrium. These become a major issue at elder age making the elderly become dependent and susceptible to home accidents. The aim of this research is to increase the security, confidence and independence of the elderly as well as their relatives. To achieve such objective, this research proposes using a network of multiple Kinect sensors installed in different areas of a house monitoring the individual with the ability to interact with the person by voice or video, if required. The Kinect sensors analyze the everyday life and routines of the person. This analysis allows the individual to be traced, and means an automatic detection of risks in real time, decreasing the response time required in the event of a health emergency.",

abstract="Population ageing is an issue that has encouraged the development of Ambient Intelligence systems to support elderly people to live autonomously at home longer. Some key aspects of these systems are the detection of behavior patterns and behavior profiles in their daily life. The information we can infer from these patterns could prove to be very valuable for monitoring the health status of a person, like to control deterioration of diseases or to provide personalized assistive services. In this paper we focus on the unsupervised learning techniques in health monitoring systems for elderly people, which has the advantage of not needing annotations. Collecting these is a tedious job and sometimes difficult to accomplish. We discuss the different existing approaches, identify some limitations and propose possible challenges and directions for future research.",

abstract="Our research group has been studying a speech communication system with a virtual agent (VA), to support person-centered care (PCC) of people with dementia (PWD). The current system uses an unfamiliar avatar for the VA, which causes a limitation in the care effects. In this paper, we develop a novel system that dynamically creates a VA based on a given facial image. The proposed system constructs a three-dimensional model based on facial landmarks within the image. It then stretches and transforms some portions of the 3D model to generate facial expressions. From just a given picture, the proposed system easily generates a communication agent familiar with individual PWD. Hence, it can implement (virtual, but effective) conversations with familiar partners.",

Depth video is provided by low-cost RGB-D sensors unobtrusively installed in the house. The user's location, posture, as well as point cloud -based features related to gestures are extracted; a standing/sitting posture detector, as well as novel features expressing head and hand gestures are introduced herein. To model the target activities, we employed discriminative HCRFs and compared them to HMMs. Through experimental evaluation, HCRFs outperformed HMMs in location trajectories-based ADL detection. By fusing trajectories data with posture and the proposed gesture features, ADL detection performance was found to further improve, leading to recognition rates at the level of 90.5 {\%} for five target activities in a naturalistic home environment.",

abstract="Home environments are one of the subjects of study regarding ambient intelligent systems for various purposes, including development of assistance systems for the elderly and energy consumption optimization. Sensing the environmental state via different sensors is the first and crucial component of every ambient intelligent system. In this work we investigate the use of environmental sounds for touch-free audio-based device recognition in a home environment. For this purpose, we analyzed sound characteristics of typical home appliances using different processing techniques. We are using the acquired knowledge to develop a flexible set of features, which can be set manually or determined automatically. To classify the device-specific acoustic fingerprints -- consisting of a significant subset of our features -- we use established supervised learning techniques, whereby we optimized the straightforward ones. After building a recognition basis for the recognition of fixed length sound buffers on demand, we implemented a live recognition mode for real-time environment monitoring, providing runtime setup adjustments. We then extended our work with the recognition of untrained, simultaneously working, known devices by mixing their records, utilizing semi-supervised learning. We then anticipated promising results in our evaluation in various aspects, including recognition rate, performance for the different combinations of features, as well as to study the reliability of an automatic mixing of trained data.",

In this area, specific tasks undertaken by the persons in the context of their normal day-to-day lives reveal a wealth of information to be used to customize their environment to improve their living experience. In our current work we investigate the development of models which can be used to represent, classify and monitor basic human behaviors and support observation and control of activities of daily living. In particular, in this paper we focus on the problem of automated recognition of sequences of events that may indicate critical conditions and unexpected behaviors requiring intervention and attention from caregivers. Our work is based on a formal framework developed with temporal logic used for the specification of critical sequences of patterns and a behavior checking engine for automated recognition. In addition we have also developed an approach to provide a means of interaction with user. A visual formalism for the specification of Linear Temporal Logic expressions reduces the barrier of technical complexity enabling the involvement of experts in the domain of healthcare services to interact with the system.",

abstract="Early results from a field trial regarding the assessment of functional status relevant to self-care ability in domestic environments are presented. A previously developed technical system for unobtrusively recording location information using home automation data was installed in the homes of five participants aged 64--84 years over a period of partially more than nine month. The recordings are manually evaluated to check whether items of geriatric assessment tests relevant to self-care ability can be assessed using the sensor recordings. The evaluation is a preliminary step to develop an automatic assessment algorithm and to develop a model for mapping domestic assessment results to result scales of clinical assessment tests. The mapping is required since most clinical assessment tests are not suitable for execution in domestic environments and thus new approaches are required which do also account for the difference between performance and capacity in functional abilities as proposed within WHO's ICF.",

The work presented addresses these questions 1) What daily activities the elderly participants like to be monitored, 2) With whom they would want to share this monitored data and 3) How a monitoring system for the elderly should be designed. For this purpose, this paper discusses the study results and participatory design techniques used to exemplify and understand desired ambient-assisted living scenarios and information sharing needs. Particularly, an interactive dollhouse is presented as a method for including the elderly in the design and requirements gathering process for residential monitoring. The study results indicate the importance of exemplifying ambient-assisted living scenarios to involve the elderly and so to increase acceptance and utility of such systems. The preliminary studies presented show that the participants were willing to have most of their daily activities monitored. However, they mostly wanted to keep control over their own data and share this information with medical specialists and particularly not with their fellow elderly neighbours.",

abstract="Community care is a complex operation that requires the interaction of large numbers of dedicated individuals, managed by an equally wide range of organisations. They are also by their nature highly mobile and flexible, moving between clients in whatever order person receiving care is that they receive what they expect regularly, reliably and when they expect to receive it. Current systems are heavily provider focused on providing the scheduled care with as high apparent cost effectiveness as possible. Unfortunately, the lack of focus on the client often leads to inflexibility with expensive services being provided when they are not needed, large scale duplication of effort or inadequate flexibility to change the care regime to meet changing circumstances. Add to this the problems associated with the lack of integration of emergency and routing care and the extensive support given by friends and family and many opportunities exist to improve both the levels of support and the efficiency of care. The move towards Individual Care Plans requires much closer monitoring to ensure that the care specified for each individual is actually delivered and when linked with smart home technology in conjunction with appropriate sensors allows a much richer range of services to be offered which can be customised to meet the needs of each individual, giving them the assurance to continue to live independently.",

abstract="Social isolation in urban areas is a societal challenge. It affects people of all ages but particularly elderly who struggle to maintain social ties into later-life. Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory. It proposes the use of the Integrated Behavior Model as a theoretical framework for understanding behavioral determinants and explores the use of games as a way of fostering changes in attitudes that could enhance intergenerational interactions.",

Meeting this objective will require us to address fundamental and long-term research challenges in how computing technologies and concepts relate and adapt to a range of everyday domestic environments, including those characterised as `care' settings. The Digital Care project employs a multidisciplinary research team to facilitate the development of enabling technologies to assist care in the community for particular user groups with different support needs. The general aim is to examine how digital technology can be used to provide various kinds of support to sheltered housing residents and their staff.

abstract="In this paper, a method for location recognition in a visual lifelog is presented. Its motivation is the detection of activity related places within an indoor environment to facilitate navigation in the lifelog. It takes advantage of a camera mounted on the shoulder, which is primarily designed for the behavioral analysis of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). The proposed approach provides an automatic indexing of the content stream, based on the presence in specific 3D places related to instrumental activites. It relies on 3D models of the places of interest that are built thanks to a lightweight semi-supervised approach. Performance evaluation on real data show the potential of this approach compared to 2D only recognition.",

abstract="An early diagnosis of a neurodegenerative process like the Alzheimer's disease needs a tele-surveillance at home based on the recording of pathologic signals coming both from the cardiac activity (for detecting the loss of the sinus respiratory arrhythmia) and from the repetition of tasks of the daily life (signing a pathologic behavior called perseveration), whose non-invasive detection can lead to an early diagnosis, if it triggers secondly a battery of tests based on brain imaging, clinical neurology and cognitive sciences to confirm the suspicion of neuronal degeneration. For increasing the efficiency of alarms triggering these tests, we use dedicated tailored data compression methods, whose two examples will be presented, the Dynalets method for quantitative compression of the physiologic signals and the monotonic signature for qualitative compression.",

abstract="Spoken dialogue technology has developed considerably over the past thirty years both in terms of research activity as well as in terms of commercially deployed applications. This chapter presents an overview of trends in dialogue research based on an analysis of papers that were presented at Eurospeech- Interspeech conferences in 1989, 1999, and 2009. Following this some challenges are identified, in particular, the issues faced by individual researchers and those in small groups who wish to build viable end-to-end dialogue systems and the difficulties that are often encountered by trying to access the many resources and toolkits that are required for dialogue academic researchers when research. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some opportunities for future research, including the integration of dialogue technology into voice search applications and the application of spoken dialogue technology in ambient intelligence environments.",

abstract="Software companies face high pressure to develop innovative products and services at increasing speed. However, a traditional new product development (NPD) process is not always a sufficient means for doing this. We report experiences from an explorative multiple case study covering eight cases from four companies of different sizes and business characteristics. Each case aimed to streamline the development of a product or service innovation in a Lean startup manner as an alternative to the traditional NPD. We present eight life-cycle paths that together exemplify the use of the five organizational alternatives, such as internal startup and company subsidiary. Driving force to choose the organizational alternative is novel business endeavor rather than being depended on the company. Using even multiple organizational alternatives is possible during the innovation life-cycle as long as the speed and independence for the innovation is achieved.",

The improvements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) have resulted in the development of equipment that supports ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and intelligent user interfaces. The smart home technologies, assisted robotics, sensors for health monitoring and e-health solutions are some examples in this category. Despite such growth in these individualized technologies, there are only few solutions that provide integrated AAL frameworks that interconnect all of these technologies. In this paper, we discuss the necessity to opt for an integrated solution in AAL. To support the study we describe real life scenarios that help us justify the need for integrated solutions over individualized ones. Our analysis points to the clear conclusion that an integrated solution for AAL outperforms the individualized ones.",

abstract="Product personalisation has become a central topic and expected part of every day life. Different people have different characteristics and abilities and each user has different needs which means that products have to be tailored accordingly. Microwave ovens are one of the most commonly used home appliances. People use them to quickly heat or cook certain foods. Today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 90{\%} of U.S. households own a microwave oven. This project seeks to enable people with intellectual disabilities and physical impairments to perform simple cooking tasks. The target group includes ageing people who experience difficulties in using microwave systems, with a particularly low grade of autonomy in preparing foods and meals. In order to address the specific needs of the defined group of users, the research follows the principles of the Quality Function Deployment analysis and takes inspiration from the DfA (Design for All) theories and the UCD (User Centred Design) method. The aim of the research is to find new solutions in order to simplify certain activities of daily living for users who would otherwise be excluded from these actions. In the second stage, the project, seeks to provide a set of tools that enable the interaction with smart appliances to grow the sense of community, by sharing information within a social network and a Cloud-based service system. The main challenge is to create a ``Community Supported Appliance'' that provides technology and settings for enabling users in performing one daily activity. The CSA is intended to be a simple to use, affordable learning system, continuously fed from the community of carers and service users, that has the potential to be used, in the near future, by a wider group of people. A device of this type benefits from added value given from expert users to others in the community, in the form of sequenced multimedia instructions to the person and direct operating instructions to the appliance.",

According to recent studies in Gerontology, one of the challenges that an elderly person has to confront is solitude and boredom. With the detectability of emotions through Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), one can provide reliable services to the elderly that address their emotional needs. In this paper the applications of the Emotiv EPOC, a BCI, is explained by developing a system called AWARE which helps mitigate loneliness in the life of an elderly and provides emergency services and other services based on their real-time emotional state. The AWARE system uses a model of computation that has taken pervasive computing to the next level by reducing the need for an explicit user input and facilitates the understanding of the user's emotions by the system to address theirs emotional needs.",

We believe that this study will help develop information and communication technology (ICT) systems for caring for people with dementia (PWD). We installed a video monitoring system for caregivers in three homes and observed the positive and negative effects of applying the system to caregiving. In terms of positive effects, the video monitoring system enabled caregivers to optimize their work and helped them concentrate on their tasks at hand, reducing both mental and physical stresses. On the other hand, some caregivers expressed concerns over being watched by other caregivers through the monitor, especially when their activities were recorded. We discuss these issues and explain how the concept of a Triage Support Environment may lead to a solution for these problems.",

Current computing interfaces, such as keyboards, mice, etc. will be removed at all or replaced by human ways of interaction like voice, gesture, emotions, etc. In order to materialize this new way of interaction between computing and people, we proposed a virtual butler able to make the link between ambient intelligence in general or smart spaces in particular and people. In fact, this is our second attempt to achieve that. Although tailored for smart homes, this virtual butler could be applied to other types of smart spaces and environments, such as shopping malls, airports, industry, etc. The developed virtual butler is able to interact with users by voice and it is sensitive to user location (and other context information).",

Three themes that have dominated are context awareness, ambient intelligence and monitoring/tracking. While these avenues of research have been fruitful their accomplishments do not match up to anything like Weiser's world. This paper discusses why this is so and argues that is time for a change of direction in the field. An alternative agenda is outlined that focuses on engaging rather than calming people. Humans are very resourceful at exploiting their environments and extending their capabilities using existing strategies and tools. I describe how pervasive technologies can be added to the mix, outlining three areas of practice where there is much potential for professionals and laypeople alike to combine, adapt and use them in creative and constructive ways.",

abstract="Fall detection has been an active research problem as fall detection technology is critical for the ageing-at-home of the elderly and it can enhance life safety of the elderly and boost their confidence of ageing-at-home by immediately alerting fall occurrence to care givers. This paper presents an algorithm of fall detection for the ageing-at-home of the elderly. This algorithm detects fall events by identifying (human) shape state change pattern reflecting a fall incident from video recorded by a single fixed camera. The novelty of the algorithm is multiple. First, it detects fall occurrence by identifying the state change pattern. Second, it uses the camera projection matrix in its computing. Thus, it eliminates camera setting-related learning. Lastly, it adds constraints to state change pattern to reduce false alarms. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a promising performance.",

abstract="In recent years, much research has focused its attention on Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Its potential applications to smart homes, hospitals, health monitoring or daily life assistance make this paradigm a very promising field of research that can have a great and positive impact in our lives. The combination of AmI environments and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has emerged as a perfect solution for the development of this kind of applications. However, there are many challenges to be addressed before such applications can be put into practice. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on MAS aimed to build rehabilitation systems for people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and explain how this architecture has been applied for the development of Vi-SMARt: a system for defining and planning therapies for people with ABI, and to control and evaluate their rehabilitation process.",

abstract="In the personal or corporate spheres, the home/office of tomorrow is soon to be the home/office of today, with a plethora of networked devices embedded in appliances, such as mobile phones, televisions, thermostats, and lamps, making it possible to automate and remotely control many basic household functions with a high degree of accuracy. In this domain, technological standardization is still in its infancy, or remains fragmented. The different functionalities of the various appliances, as well as market factors, imply that the devices that control them communicate via a multitude of different protocols (KNX, LonWorks, InOne). Building a high level middleware to support all the appliances seems to be a reasonable approach. However, market factors has shown that the emergence of a unique and universal middleware is a dream. To solve this issue, we have built a new generation of schizophrenic middleware in which service access can be generated from an abstract services description. EnTiMid, our implementation of schizophrenic middleware, supports various services access models (several personalities): SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UPnP and DPWS (Device Profile for WebServices). In this paper, we describe how these personalities are generated using a Model Driven Engineering approach and discuss the benefits of our approach in the context of a deployment of new services at the city level.",

(IRCTC) launched ``IRCTC Connect'' mobile application (app) for different mobile platforms for booking/cancellation tickets, but the app usage rate is very low in comparison to IRCTC website and Passenger Reservation System (PRS). This indicates a gap between implementation and adaption of IRCTC Connect. This paper explores the factors influencing the consumer's behavioral intention to use IRCTC Connect by adapting Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Regression analysis is used to analyze total 159 valid responses, collected through survey at MNNIT campus Allahabad, India. The findings of the study illustrate that only three factors Social Influence, Price Value and Habit of UTAUT2 model are significantly influencing the adoption of IRCTC Connect with adjusted R-Square value 0.699. This study will facilitate IRCTC Connect developers to encompass better understanding on consumers' desires and intention and encourages researchers in this area for longitudinal observation in different backgrounds.",

Besides technical functions and opportunities, the acceptance of future users is decisive for a successful implementation of those technologies in everyday life situations. As AAL technologies have an enormous potential to support care staff as well as caretakers in professional care situations, it is questionable to what extent professional care staff accepts and adopts to use assisting technologies in their professional everyday life. In more detail, it is of major interest to analyze how care professionals perceive potential benefits and barriers of AAL technology usage, specific characteristics of data gathering and storage as well as if individual user factors of care professionals influence the perception and acceptance of AAL technologies.",

abstract="The concept of ambient intelligence (AmI) has recently been adopted related to living scenarios and denoted as ambient assisted living (AAL). It has received high attention related to the demographic shift and the positive options of care and support for elderly people at home and on the move. However, there exists an equally important field of application related to work. In the context of labour high mobility and flexibility of people is requested. The demand to work up to higher ages complements the situation. People in the workforce develop growing expertise and different abilities over time. They need tailored support systems at work keeping the efficiency and effectiveness and elements of prevention or adjustment to changing abilities. Indeed, environments in industry and at work provide already a high degree of networking and computing infrastructure, much more than in the private sector and can provide a basis for an advanced AmI infrastructure. The idea is discussed within the framework of creating accessible workplaces for people with disabilities. Here, so far a reactive strategy has been followed based on the individual case. Only in case a concrete person with a disability is included in the work force and only in that very moment a workplace adaptation is considered. However, now this reactive strategy is outdated, because today the complete infrastructure needs to be considered to make a workplace accessible. Following an AmI strategy --ambient assisted working (AAW) provides a flexible approach towards workplace adaptation for all, including people with disabilities and older people in the workforce. In order to use AAW, the process has to start much earlier in a more inclusive way. Without knowing the exact demands of a future worker, the system needs to be designed. The flexible networking character of AmI provides the required flexibility.",

abstract="We propose an activity recognition system for the elderly using a wearable sensor module embedding a tri-axial accelerometer, considering maximization of battery life. The sensor module embedding both a tri-axial acceleration sensor and an RF transmission module is worn at the right side of one's waistband. It connects and transfers sensing data to subject's PDA phone. Then, an algorithm on the PDA phone accumulates the data and classifies them as an activity. We utilize 3 tilts in addition to 3 acceleration values, compared to previous works. However, we reduce the sampling rate of the sensing data for saving battery life. As an activity classifier, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm is used, and we have achieved 96{\%} of accuracy in detecting an activity out of 9. It shows the proposed method can save the battery life without losing the recognition accuracy compared to related works.",

abstract="The communicating objects of ambient environment can play a ``facilitator'' role in helping the assistive robot for locating itself, searching for a person... Conversely, the robot can be seen as a communicating object which is used by services to the person in loss of autonomy. We describe an architecture for cooperation between the robot and the ambient environment composed of sensors or actuators. One of the difficulties is that the robot is evolving in a crowded and not predictable physical environment. It is therefore necessary to have mechanisms of adaptation for answering to various or unforeseen situations so that the robot can move reliably in the home. It is necessary also to take into account two constraints, at first the degree of urgency of the service and secondly the degree of discomfort caused by the presence of a robot which is able to act near the person and see the person in her/his privacy.",

abstract="The number of smart appliances and devices in the home and office has grown dramatically in recent years. Unfortunately, these devices rarely interact with each other or the environment. In order to move from environments filled with smart devices to smart environments, there must be a framework for devices to communicate with each other and with the environment. This enables reasoners and automated decision makers to understand the environment and the data collected from it. Semantic web technologies provide this framework in a well-documented and flexible package. In this paper we present the Casas Ontology for Smart Environments (COSE) and accompanying data from a test smart environment and discuss the current and future challenges associated with a Smart Environment on the Semantic Web.",

abstract="The fast growing mobile sensor technology makes sensor-based lifelogging system attractive to the remote elderly care. However, existing lifelogging systems are weak at generating meaningful activity summaries from heterogeneous sensor data which significantly limits the usability of lifelogging systems in practice. In this paper, we introduce SensCare, a semi-automatic lifelog summarization system for elderly care. From various sensor information collected from mobile phones carried by elderlies, SensCare fuses the heterogeneous sensor information and automatically segments/recognizes user's daily activities in a hierarchical way. With a few human annotations, SensCare generates summaries of data collected from activties performed by the elderly. SensCare addresses three challenges in sensor-based elderly care systems: the rarity of activity labels, the uncertainty of activity granularities, and the difficulty of multi-dimensional sensor fusion. We conduct a set of experiments with users carrying a smart phone for multiple days and evaluate the effectiveness of the automatic summary. With proper sensor configuration, the phone can continue to monitor user's activities for more than 24 hours without charging. SensCare also demonstrates that unsupervised hierarchical activity segmentation and semi-automatic summarization can be achieved with reasonably good accuracy (average F1 score 0.65) and the system is very useful for users to recall what has happened in their daily lives.",

Environments would become smart and proactive, enriching and enhancing the experience of participants thus supporting maximum leisure possibly even at the risk of alienation. New insights have revealed that these brave new world scenarios are no longer desirable and that people are more in for a balanced approach in which technology should serve people instead of driving them to the max.

abstract="Given that the population is aging, it is crucial to develop technologies which will not only help the elderly to age in place, but also live in place with independent and healthy lifestyle. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments can help the elderly and people with functional diversity by anticipating their needs in specific situations and acting proactively in order to properly assist them in performing their activities of daily living (ADLs). Since the users needs tend to be very diverse in regard to functioning and disability levels, it is crucial to have personalized services capable of providing tailored assistance to a user based on their unique preferences, requirements, and desires. This paper introduces the ontology named AATUM (Ambient Assistive Technology User Model), to be adopted by systems whose goal is to enhance user quality of life within ALL environments through service personalization. Its main feature is the use of The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to model the user's functioning and disability levels in a consistent and internationally comparable way. The use of the proposed ontology is illustrated through its application in two different case studies.",

abstract="Keeping a healthy and balanced diet has long been a critical issue for a person wanting to stay fit and energetic in her/his daily life. We can always turn to a dietitian (or a nutritionist) for professional diet suggestions if necessary. However, we cannot have a dietitian staying with us all the time, which renders daily nutrition control very challenging. Therefore, it is desirable for each individual to receive handy and informative diet suggestions whenever necessary. In this work, we propose a Context-aware Personal Diet Suggestion System (CPDSS) which tries to maximize an aggregated health utility function and provides useful diet suggestions according to some contextual information. In order to increase the practicality of the pro- posed system, we have integrated the CPDSS with an everyday appliance--a smart refrigerator--so that we can readily access the suggestions about one's diet, receive instant context-aware reminders while preparing foods, and keep long-term diet history to extract more useful pat- terns to caregivers to provide suggestions for health improvement.",

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) refers to ambient intelligent environments where health and personal care is monitored to help to ensure elder's health, safety, and well-being, detecting possible situations that should be watched over. To effectively reason about a current situation and determine its criticality, it should be compared to past patterns. Current systems that learn patterns do not take into account the context in which they occur and we believe adding contextual variables to the description of patterns could improve the reasoning about current situations. Moreover, it can help improve the notification process to dynamically select who and what should be notified, maintaining the privacy of the elder and avoiding spam. In this paper we detail our proposal for a system that adds context to behavior patterns in order to then create personalized messages to the different members of the network of care of an elder living alone.",

abstract="Dementia occurs much more frequently in the elders who exhibit impairments of memory, thought and reasoning. In this paper, we present a hybrid context-aware reminding framework intended to help elders with mild dementia improve their level of independence and quality of life. Based on the user study in three different pilot sites, the reminding services are identified and classified into four types according to the nature and urgency. The framework with a novel scheduling mechanism is designed which handles both synchronous time-based and asynchronous event-based reminding services. In order to facilitate the interaction between the caregivers and system, we also provide a simple software tool for caregivers to create and edit the reminding services.

Also the Web Server hosts the doctor's Web Application. The Web Application is based on web front-end technologies, providing the medical personnel with a variety of features and useful actions. These actions and capabilities are mainly relevant to the assignment of instructions to patients and the monitoring of their health progress. The Android Application has been implemented and validated for the Android-based mobile devices operating system and consists of a handy and user-friendly environment, equipped with the right tools so that the patient has the ability to update the system on the progress of his/her health by storing the appropriate measurements.

abstract="Many e-health services are available to users today, but they often suffer from lack of personalization. In this paper, we present a system to generate personalized health recommendations from various providers, based on classification of health related calendar events on the user's smartphone. Due to privacy constraints, such personal data often cannot be uploaded to external servers, hence the classification and personalization has to run on the client device. We use a server to train our model to classify calendar events using SVM and fastText, while the prediction is run on the client device using the trained model. The class labels from the classified calendar events, weighted in order of recency, are used to build a vector, which we treat as a representation of user interest while personalizing the recommendations. This vector is used to re-rank health related recommendations obtained from third party providers based on relevance. We describe the implementation details of our system and some tests on its accuracy and relevance to provide relevant health related recommendations. While we used the calendar app to classify events, our system can also be extended for other apps such as messaging.",

abstract="Context-aware systems in mobile and pervasive environments face many conflicting situations while collecting sensor data, processing sensor data to extract consistent and coherent high level context information, and disseminating that context information to assist in making decisions to adapt to the continuously evolving situations without diverting human attention. These conflicting situations pose stern challenges to the design and development of context-aware systems by making it extremely complicated and error-prone. Quality of Context parameters can be used to cope with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the conflicting situations that a context-aware system may face at different layers of its conceptual design and present the conflict resolving policies that are defined on the basis of the Quality of Context parameters. We also illustrate how these policies can be used in different conflicting situations to improve the performance and effectiveness of context-aware systems.",

We experiment with angular acceleration data in three limbs parts of human test target. Different life patterns of elderly are selected to test the motion monitoring system: walking and falling. Two methods are employed as diagnosis tool. The first is the energy expenditure method, while the second is the neural network method. The first tests the sensitivity of motion sensor, while the second filters out the noisy motion data for correct classification purpose. We discovered that the trained weights and bios from the neural network based on three limbs parts measurement data has allowed us to differentiate fall from regular walk motion with high accuracy.",

Participants completed a 10-item, Likert scale measure of task self-efficacy at enrollment and after four weeks. Overall the intervention groups had a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy compared to the control. Comparisons between the two treatment delivery methods showed a medium standardized effect size (SES) in both groups compared to controls, although it did not reach statistical significance for the Tele group (SES Tele 0.35 [-2.5-.95]; Trad 0.54 [0.06-1.14]).

abstract="Stress is recognized as a factor of predominant disease and in the future the costs for treatment will increase. The presented approach tries to detect stress in a very basic and easy to implement way, so that the cost for the device and effort to wear it remain low. The user should benefit from the fact that the system offers an easy interface reporting the status of his body in real time. In parallel, the system provides interfaces to pass the obtained data forward for further processing and (professional) analyses, in case the user agrees. The system is designed to be used in every day's activities and it is not restricted to laboratory use or environments. The implementation of the enhanced prototype shows that the detection of stress and the reporting can be managed using correlation plots and automatic pattern recognition even on a very light-weighted microcontroller platform.",

abstract="Pervasive computing environments need to exhibit highly adaptive behavior to meet the changing personal requirements and operational context of environment. Recently, task computing (TC) paradigm has gained acceptance as the choice computing model for pervasive computing environment. One of the key components of TC is a task model that provides an adequate high-level description of user-oriented tasks. This paper presents a novel context-sensitive task modeling approach capable of supporting complex, user-oriented task definitions, and proposes an algorithm to discover a task and a method to execute it. This work is motivated by the fact that whilst current TC systems allow users to interact with their ambient environments in terms of high level tasks, existing task definitions are still relatively simple, and do not include user-centric and environmental contextual information in the task definition. This paper elaborates the proposed task model through a smart home application example to illustrate steps in context-dependent task modeling, service provisioning and resource organization.",

On the other hand, the software and hardware technologies has reached a maturation point were the electronic assistants can acquire information from the user through camera images, as well as to communicate with the user by means of natural voice language. In this context, a model for the adoption of electronic intelligent assistants by the elderlies has been proposed in previous work. In the current work, it is assessed the possibility of using the current consumer assistants to implement the proposed model. Several assistants are analyzed (Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple), assessing their functionalities and how they could be used to assist the elderly in strengthening their social bonds with the family, friends and ex-co-workers groups.",

abstract="Pervasive computing applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of inhabitants of the environment, such as their locations, activities, vital signs, and environmental measures. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in ``aging-in-place'' scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.",

Systems that manage these environments need to manipulate the context for interacting in a suitable way with users. One big challenge for creating a smart environment is to deal with context dynamicity. Ideally, these computer-supported environments must detect relevant events to forecast future situations and to act proactively to mitigate or eliminate situations related to specific user's needs. This paper proposes a framework for providing extensible, reactive and proactive behavior in Smart Environment systems. The focus of the present work is related to a specific class of Smart Environments: an Ambient Assisted Living. In this sense we define a framework and illustrate practical aspects of the use of framework by describing a home-care scenario in which the system observes the behavior of the user, as the time goes by, and detects relevant situations and acts reactively and proactively for preserving user health condition.",

Part of this is as a reaction to what is happening in the world; ubiquitous technologies are proliferating and transforming how we live our lives. We are becoming more connected and more dependent on technology. The home, the cr{\`e}che, outdoors, public places and even the human body are now being experimented with as potential places to embed computational devices, even to the extent of invading previously private and taboo aspects of our lives.

abstract="In this paper a psychologist discusses the desirable relationship between the elderly and Artificial Objects based on some questions raised by an engineering researcher. Concretely, the paper discusses the differences between Objects, Machines, and Artificial Objects. Through this, it reveals the characteristic of Artificial Objects and presents the following four points that can be potentially problematic with respect to the relationship between such objects and the elderly. Moreover, these points should also be kept in mind by engineering researchers when developing Artificial Objects. 1) Artificial objects move autonomously, and therefore users can not take the role of initiator. That is, people must accommodate to artificial objects. 2) Artificial objects still only have a limited learning ability for creating relationships with their users, including the understanding of contexts and a shared history not unlike that between people. 3) Even with increased leaning ability as a result of increased efficacy and expanded operating capacity, which in turn leads to the creation of better relationships between artificial objects and persons, there are limitations to such relationships. 4) There is a need to point out the problem of initially focusing too heavily on the functions that artificial objects should have. Especially for the elderly, engineers should take time to consider the relationships of dependency that the objects they design will gradually foster over time.",

This paper describes a monitoring kit that provides alarms to the caregiver in case of dangerous situations or unusual events detected by the sensors. It is composed by a set of non-intrusive sensors installed within the house, and can be configured in order to best fit with the needs of each patient. The proposed system could have the potentiality to reduce the stress that usually affects the caregivers, due to the continuous effort required and the worry about the patients' safety. The improved system results from an existing solution that has been re-visited according to the feedbacks obtained from a pilot trial.",

abstract="Research on context management and activity recognition in smart environments is essential in the development of innovative well adapted services. This paper presents two main contributions. First, we present ContextAct@A4H, a new real-life dataset of daily living activities with rich context data (This research is supported by the Amiqual4Home Innovation Factory, http://amiqual4home.inria.frfunded by the ANR (ANR-11-EQPX-0002)). It is a high quality dataset collected in a smart apartment with a dense but non intrusive sensor infrastructure. Second, we present the experience of using temporal logic and model checking for activity recognition. Temporal logic allows specifying activities as complex events of object usage which can be described at different granularity. It also expresses temporal ordering between events thus palliating a limitation of ontology based activity recognition. The results on using the CADP toolbox for activity recognition in the real life collected data are very good.",

abstract="As the world population is growing older, more and more peoples are facing health issues. For elderly, leaving alone can be tough and risky, typically, a fall can have serious consequences for them. Consequently, smart homes are becoming more and more popular. Such sensors enriched environment can be exploited for health-care applications, in particular Anomaly Detection (AD). Currently, most AD solutions only focus on detecting anomalies in the user daily activities while omitting the ones from the environment itself. For instance the user may have forgotten the pan on the stove while he/she is phoning. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting anomaly occurring in the home environment during user activities: CAREDAS. We propose a combination between ontologies and Markov Logic Network to classify the situations to anomaly classes. Our system is implemented, tested and evaluated using real data obtained from the Hadaptic platform. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.",

abstract="The modern evolution of healthcare systems towards even more complex networks has highlighted the emerging need of a standardized and interoperable model for the management of health data. Several studies in the past years have underlined how the adoption of Semantic Web technologies can provide a valuable solution for both of the aforementioned needs. Semantic modelling of health-data can indeed provide a sound and sharable conceptualization of a patient's health condition and can leverage automatic generation of new knowledge related to the clinical contexts. In fact, thanks to reasoning processes these technologies can be used as part of decision-support systems in a variety of domains. In this paper two examples of ontologies are presented. Both models rely on a worldwide-known classification and are the basis for two decision-support tools related to the Ambient Assisted Living and Work Reintegration domains, which enable cooperation among different clinical and non-clinical stakeholders.",

abstract="Activity Recognition in Smart Environments presents a difficult learning problem. The focus of this paper is a 10-class activity recognition problem using motion sensor events over time involving multiple residents and non-scripted activities. This paper presents the results of using three different graph-based approaches to this problem, and compares them to a non-graph SVM approach. The graph-based approaches are generating feature vectors using frequent subgraphs for classification by an SVM, an SVM using a graph kernel and nearest neighbor approach using a graph comparison measure. None demonstrate significantly superior accuracy compared to the non-graph SVM, but all demonstrate strongly uncorrelated error both against the base SVM and each other. An ensemble is created using the non-graph SVM, Frequent Subgraph SVM, Graph Kernel SVM, and Nearest Neighbor. Error is shown to be highly uncorrelated between these four. This ensemble substantially outperforms all of the approaches alone. Results are shown for a 10-class problem arising from smart environments, and a 2-class one-vs-all version of the same problem.",

In this paper, we present a study that examines how users conceptualize applications involving automated capture and playback of home activities and reveals a breadth of home applications that people desire. We introduce CAMP, a system that enables end-user programming for smart home environments based on a magnetic poetry metaphor. We describe how CAMP's simple interface for creating applications supports users' natural conceptual models of capture applications. Finally, we present a preliminary evaluation of CAMP and assess its ability to support a breadth of desired home applications as well as the user's conceptual model.",

Such environments, which include smart homes, hospitals, campuses, etc., are oriented towards human comfort and safety. Detecting the presence of a human being in spaces within such environment forms a major challenge. Though there are sensors that can perform this task, they are not without limitations. Using information derived from either single or multiple sensors separately is not sufficient to distinguish human beings from other objects within the environment. Reliable detection of human presence can be achieved only by fusing information obtained from multiple sensors. In this paper, we describe an approach to human presence detection using a combination of PIR and ultrasonic sensors. Analysis is performed based on the received raw signals from the PIR as well as an analog ultrasonic sensor. A voting based approach has been used to classify signals obtained from human beings and non-human objects, thereby facilitating human presence detection. Results obtained from indoor experiments performed using this approach substantiate the viability of its use in real environments.",

Applications are progressively required to run on multiple computing platforms and accommodate the capabilities of different devices.

The current approach of designing separate user interfaces, one for each target use, is time consuming, error prone, and does not adequately addresses the challenges of cross-platform consistency, universal access and integration. To this end, this paper proposes a new integrative approach to multi-device user interface development for achieving device-independence by-design and further pursuing improved levels user experience for all through adaptive presentational models for various devices and contexts of use.

To reach this objective, the paper presents ways to classify the activity of walking, in order to propose a method to measure weight variation at the right time and in a good position.

To explore the usefulness of the typology, we present four example chatbot purposes for which the typology may support analysis of high-level chatbot interaction design.

It is based on three main components: (1) Measurement and analysis of the cognitive and physical capabilities of the user, (2) Measurement and validation of the flat and (3) Computation of areas with a higher risk to fall and advice to remove such issues, e.g. restructuring of the furniture. The great benefit of a mobile robot platform is that all needed sensors are mounted on the robot and it can follow the user to make measurements at different places in the home. This will reduce the cost and installation effort in the flat to a minimum. Another benefit is the continuous assessment which helps to restructure the flat in a continuous way. This helps to reduce the probability of a fall event and raise the feeling of safety. All measurements could also be used by other assessment tools to preserve the indoor mobility not only by preventing a fall event but also by reacting on changes in the mobility level over time.",

abstract="This paper presents the results of a feasibility study. The study addresses baseline investigations regarding possibilities and modes of cooperation, as well as regarding possible integrative (multimodal) mobility supplies (e.g. between public transport and health care facilities) based on open data. In result, existing digital data were specified and checked whether and how they can be used, together with existing open data of the mCloud and other sources, to create an effective steering- and prognosis base for the (digital) control of traffic flows of health care centres. Therefore, potentials were identified about how the data of health care centres may enrich a regional data basis and thereby enhance municipal traffic control systems. In result, existing possibilities and barriers of the preferably sustainable satisfaction of prevailing mobility demands of patients, employees and visitors were assessed with regards to feasibility in terms of mobility supply. Another focus was put on the development of sustainable mobility solutions, which help to reduce emissions and other negative effects of traffic. Besides results of empirical surveys, an architecture for a data- and mobility platform was compiled for implementation.",

This paper explores these applications and the portrayal of people with disabilities within the social robotics discourse. Our review of social robotics literature revealed that social robotics mainly portrays disabled people through a medical/body ability deficiency lens, namely identifying deficient abilities, and then proposing how a certain robot can fix them and give the individual ``normal'' functioning. However, within the Disabled People Rights Movement, the academic field of disability studies, and existing legal documents, a second narrative is evident which focuses less on `fixing' the person to the species-typical norm, and more on increasing the participation in society of that person the way they are. We submit that the second type of narrative and its way of defining problems and solutions needs more visibility within the social robotics discourse and in the vision of possible products.",

This paper proposes an approach with the aim of improving the accuracy and robustness of a location recognition approach based on RFID technology. A method was introduced for the optimal deployment of an RFID reader network, which aims to minimize the hardware cost whilst achieving high localization accuracy. A functional subarea mapping approach was proposed based on both a coarse-grained and a fine-grained method. Experimental results indicated that the coarse-grained mapping provided a higher overall accuracy of location detection. The average subarea location accuracy achieved based on coarse-grained and fine-grained data was 85.4{\%} and 68.7{\%}, respectively. Nevertheless it was found that the fine-grained mapping approach was capable of providing more information in relation to the details of the functional subareas. This implies that we need to balance the requirements between the size of the subareas and the location accuracy.",

In order to understand the impact of specific usage contexts, in which mobile services are applied, an ICT context was contrasted to a medical service context. Outcomes show that acceptance factors are neither static nor independent from the specific usage or service context in which a technology is applied.

We consider the term ``context'' in a broader meaning including presence and location of humans and objects, human behavior, human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction, activities of daily living, etc. We expect that the surrounding environment from which context is gathered is a ``smart environment'', i.e. a space (such as office, house, or public area) equipped with different sets of sensors, including audio and visual perception. Designing the underlying perceptual systems is a non-trivial task which involves interdisciplinary effort dealing with the integration of voice and image recognition technologies, situation modeling middleware, and context-aware interfaces into a robust and self-manageable software framework. To support fast development and tuning of dialog-based services, we introduce a simulation framework compliant with the proposed architecture. The framework is capable of gathering information from a broad set of sensors, of an event-based abstraction of such information, interaction with an integrated dialog system, and of a virtual representation of a smart environment in schematic 2D or realistic 3D projections. We elaborate on use-cases of architecture model referring the two projects where our system was successfully deployed.",

DANTE is able to interpret the position and orientation of any object that is tagged with a special marker. Offline, users navigate frame-by-frame through captured scenes to annotate onset/completion of object interactions. The main utility is supporting the development of large annotated datasets, which is essential for the development and evaluation of context-aware models to interpret and monitor occupant behaviour within smart environments. DANTE only records scenes during which `tagged' objects are interacted with therefore significantly reducing the amount of redundant footage recorded. The current study has extended the concepts of DANTE and has used it to support the annotation of additional sensor platforms. Results demonstrated both the capability of DANTE to support annotation of other platforms along with reducing the amount of time previously required to manually annotate such data by more than 45{\%}.",

Our fall detection systems aims to solve this problem by automatically detecting falls and notify healthcare services or the victim's caregivers so as to provide help. In this paper, development of a fall detection system based on Kinect sensor is introduced. Current fall detection algorithms were surveyed and we developed a novel posture recognition algorithm to improve the specificity of the system. Data obtained through trial testing with human subjects showed a 26.5{\%} increase in fall detection compared to control algorithms. With our novel detection algorithm, the system conducted in a simulated ward scenario can achieve up to 90{\%} fall detection rate.",

In this paper, details of an investigation considering the impact of everyday activities on heart rate are presented. ECG and accelerometer signals collected from wearable wireless sensors have been utilized to investigate the underlying relationships between physiological and activity-related profile information. The impact of activities on heart rate has been captured through analysis of the patterns of heart rate using the CUSUM algorithm. Subsequently, results have shown that a change in the pattern of heart rate is detected shortly after an activity commences. Further extensions of the research are also proposed, including integration of a range of ECG features and intelligent data analysis techniques, thereby facilitating the future development of context aware health monitoring mechanisms.",

abstract="Increasing care needs represent major challenges for today's care sectors. Developing assistive technologies such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems pose a potential approach to face these challenges by relieving care staff or facilitating everyday life, e.g., for people with disabilities. Thereby, acceptance is essential for a sustainable adoption of assistive technologies in real life. So far, research has focused on technology-related as well as demographic factors and persons' attitudes (e.g., technical self-efficacy) impacting technology acceptance. In contrast, individual attitudes towards the own situation - in particular individual attitudes towards care -- have not been considered as potential influencing factors on the acceptance of assistive technologies. In order to create an appropriate measuring instrument for attitudes towards care, two empirical studies were carried out: In an online survey study (n = 34) persons' attitudes towards the own care situation and their relationships to attitudes towards usage of assistive technologies were studied out of the perspective of people with disabilities. The exploratory confirmed instrument ``attitudes towards care'' was related with acceptance and perception of assistive technologies focusing on people of different ages with physical disabilities. Results of the second study (n = 64) verified these relationships focusing on elderly people in need of care. This suggests that attitudes towards care are acceptance-relevant for diverse groups of people. The results can be used to investigate relationships between individual perceptions of care and (assistive) technology acceptance in detail and to refine and adapt the attitude towards care instrument for diverse user groups.",

abstract="The acceptance of novel technology is one if not the most decisive component of the success of the technology rollout. Though, acceptance criteria differ not only across the diversity of users, but might also differ across the different usage context. This is especially valid for technologies in the health and beauty context, in which the balance between pro-using arguments and contra-using arguments is especially fragile. This paper focuses on the impact of the context towards the motivation to use an invasive technology. A survey was conducted in which 170 participants of a wide age range (17-89 years) took part. In the study, three different usage scenarios were presented (medical scenario, preventative healthcare scenario and beauty scenario). After an introduction into each scenario the participants had to evaluate usage motives and barriers. The results corroborated the impact of the situational context and the dependency of acceptance outcomes on the reasons for which technology might be used. Overall, acceptance was highest for medical technology and lowest for the beauty context. Considering the single reasons for or against the technology, we find that nature and weighing of perceived barriers and concerns are quite similar, independently of the context.",

To overcome this issue, we propose an ontology-based context fusion framework in this research that fuses the related and relevant context information collected about the patient's daily life activities for better understanding of patient's situation and behavior. The fused context information is logged using ontological representation in Life Log deployed on cloud server. On top of the Life Log, behavior analysis and prediction services are developed to analyze the behavior of the patient and provide better healthcare, wellness, and behavior prediction services.

Wearable sensors can provide such support but may constitute a source of stigma for the user if they are perceived as visible and therefore obtrusive. This paper presents an initial empirical investigation exploring the extent to which wearable sensors are perceived as visible. 23 Participants wore eye tracking glasses, which superimposed the location of their gaze onto video data of their panorama. Participants were led to believe that the research entailed a subjective evaluation of the eye tracking glasses. A researcher wore one of two wearable sensors during the evaluation enabling us to measure the extent to which participants fixated on the sensor during a one-on-one meeting. Results are presented on the general visibility and potential fixations on two wearable sensors, a wrist-work actigraph and a lifelogging camera, during normal conversation between two people. Further investigation is merited according to the results of this pilot study.",

abstract="With the advance of IT technologies, a new type of computing device will be introduced for smart environments in the near future. In this paper, we outline our on-going development of the robotic computer that naturally interacts with users, understands the current situation of users and environments, and proactively provides users with services. The proposed robotic computer consists of a control unit and an agent unit. The control unit, which is a remote processing server connected to the host server of the smart environment, provides memory (high-level information) and processing (computing resources) capabilities to the agent unit. The agent unit is a portable device which is wirelessly connected to the control unit, and interacts with users and physical objects. We describe the system architecture and the implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed robotic computer.",

abstract="Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory, and its associated Dempster rule of combination, has been widely used to determine belief based on uncertain evidence sources. Variations to the original Dempster rule of combination have appeared in the literature to support particular scenarios where unreliable results may result from the use of original DS theory. While theoretical explanations of the rule variations are explained, there is a lack of empirical comparisons of the DS theory and its variations against real data sets. In this work, we examine several variations to DS theory. Using two real-world sensor data sets, we compare the performance of DS theory and several of its variations in recognising situations. The empirical results shed insight on how to select these fusion rules based on the nature of sensor data, the relationship of this data over time to the higher level hypotheses and the choice of frame of discernment.",

This contribution presents an analysis of ambient intelligence scenarios, particularly in regard to AmI's impacts on and implications for individual privacy. The analysis draws on our review of more than 70 AmI projects, principally in Europe. It notes the visions as well as the specifics of typical AmI scenarios. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis, not least of which is that most AmI scenarios depict a rather too sunny view of our technological future. Finally, reference is made to the SWAMI project (Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence) which, inter alia, has constructed ''dark'' scenarios, as we term them, to show how things can go wrong in AmI and where safeguards are needed.",

abstract="In previous works overall activity and inactivity levels of users living in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) enabled flats were determined using standard home automation sensors. The flats are regular dwellings for long-term use by approximately 30 tenants located in Kaiserslautern, Germany. In this real-world AAL project it was shown that basic inactivity alarms based on linear thresholds can be triggered within 30 to 180 minutes after the occurrence of a potential emergency. However, inactivity alarms are somewhat coarse and do not make full use of additional information inherent in the raw sensor data: spatial and temporal information regarding the location of a tenant in their flat and the time spent in a room. Using that information, it can be determined in which room a tenant has resided for how long at a given time. Hence, in this paper a method for location tracking is proposed, forming a novel alarming criterion.",

We evaluate in two pilot scenarios. In the first, data-engineers bring together public and enterprise datasets about public safety. In the second, knowledge-engineers and domain-experts, build a view of health and social care providers for vulnerable populations.

The proposed architecture is shown simple and low cost, has low implementation complexity and high extension capability. The user profile data are stored on the user's mobile device for privacy. As the profile is defined by the user, it is expected that the interface adaptation occurs more accurately. A prototype is presented as a proof of concept.",

abstract="This article reports on the issue of arrangement of public services. We argue that public services offered together in one building are often combined without consideration of citizens' needs. It is not unusual for services to be arranged only according to organizational charts of public administration bodies or space availability. Thus we postulate a shift of perspective from administration-centered to user-centered approach that should be applied in the public administration in general and in public services in particular. To this end we propose a method for decision support on user-centered arrangements of public services. The method is a planning and evaluation tool based on feature modelling. It makes it possible to describe services from the user perspective and compare them in terms of their advantageous arrangement in a facility building. The method has been tested on a real case study and the results are presented and discussed.",

This study compares the openness to accept medical technology in Germany, Poland and Turkey. 300 respondents (19-85 years, 56{\%} women, 38{\%} chronically ill) participated in a survey, in which the pros and cons for using medical technologies were examined as well as the underlying acceptance motives and utilization barriers. The effects of different cultures, but also of age, gender and health status were analyzed regarding their impact on acceptance patterns. Results reveal both, culturally insensitive as well culturally sensitive acceptance, with strong effects of gender and exercising frequency.

The presented video monitoring system is to mitigate situations of this kind. If an emergency is detected, an automatic alarm will be raised. One of the main aspects of the developed assistance system is to be as unobtrusive as possible to achieve a high acceptance among the users. Moreover, the system needs to work very robustly in individual home environments.

abstract="Bed-related situation monitoring is a crucial task in geriatric healthcare. Due to shortage of qualified caregivers, automatic detection of the situation in a bedroom is desirable since risks may arise when an elder gets up from the bed alone. In addition, analyzing the total amount of care time of an elder is helpful when the social effect on the improvement of the elder's health needs to be evaluated. This paper presents a context-aware healthcare system which makes use of multi-modal and un-obtrusive sensing technology meanwhile taking human feeling into account. Specifically, we choose ambient sensors such as pressure straps and a laser scanner to monitor both the activity of the elder and his/her surroundings. Moreover, a context fusion is further proposed to infer the situation of the elder. Experimental results demonstrate the high promise of our proposed methods for bed-related situation awareness.",

abstract="Dementia is an escalating problem which is estimated to affect 35.6 million people worldwide. In an environment which is becoming increasingly dependent on technology, the interaction needs of people living with dementia is being ignored by interface designers. This paper aims to highlight the factors which should be considered when designing interfaces to be ``dementia-friendly''. The article draws on the limited previous research to suggest that interfaces need to consider two main factors: personalisation (which includes both accessibility and usability) and user acceptance (including the experience produced by the interfaces and barriers to technology adoption).",

abstract="Medical Technology is one of the rising branches of technology development within the last decades. Especially device miniaturization is enormously progressing what makes implantable technology to a promising approach for the future. Especially in times of the demographic change implantable medical technology could play its part in the delivery of healthcare services, supporting an independent and mobile aging. From a technical point of view, implants are far-developed and will enter the market in the next years. From a human factors' point of view, there is a considerable lack of acceptance-related knowledge and understanding of perceived benefits and barriers across a diverse population. Using a qualitative approach, this study gains insights into public perceptions of implantable medical technology, the level of information revealing misconceptions and basic fears. It thus explores cognitive and affective factors that form the acceptance of implantable medical technology. Results allow the identification of information and technical communication deficits in order to derive a sensitive information and communication policy.",

The achievement of this purpose is possible by means of various technologies and systems (such as, for instance, home environment sensors, personal sensors and clinical devices). This article describes the design and early development of a software tool, that allows to control an AAL System, completely based on an ontological approach. From this innovative point of view, an ontological formalization is used to describe a domain and to implement an automatic reason. This approach provides a dynamic model that can change its state and expand accordingly to rules that are also a part of the model. Such a description is continually updated with information provided by the AAL System database that reports the significant events recorded by the sensors. Then, exploiting the potential of an OWL-DL reasoner, decisions about the feedbacks that the System have to activate, are inferred.",

abstract="Alzheimer's disease can severely impair the independent lifestyle of a person. Dem@Care is an European research project that conducted a study for timely diagnosis of Alzheimers disease by collecting everyday motion data from couples (or dyads), with one of the person in the couple having AD. Their results suggest that AD can be detected using everyday motion data from accelerometers. They did evaluation based on leave-one-person-out cross-validation. However, this evaluation can introduce bias in the classification results because one of the person from the dyad is present in the training set while the other is being tested. In this paper, we revisit the Dem@Care study and propose a new evaluation method that performs leave one-dyad-out cross-validation to remove the dataset selection bias. We then introduce new domain specific features based on dynamic and static intervals of motions that significantly improves the classification results. We further show increase in performance by combining the proposed features with new time, frequency domain and baseline features used in the Dem@Care study.",

abstract="In this paper, we describe a human posture classification and a falling detector module suitable for smart homes and assisted living solutions. The system uses a neural network that processes the human joints produced by a skeleton tracker using the depth streams of an RGB-D sensor. The neural network is able to recognize standing, sitting and lying postures. Using only the depth maps from the sensor, the system can work in poor light conditions and guarantees the privacy of the person. The neural network is trained with a dataset produced with the Kinect tracker, but it is also tested with a different human tracker (NiTE). In particular, the aim of this work is to analyse the behaviour of the neural network even when the position of the extracted joints is not reliable and the provided skeleton is confused. Real-time tests have been carried out covering the whole operative range of the sensor (up to 3.5 m). Experimental results have shown an overall accuracy of 98.3{\%} using the NiTE tracker for the falling tests, with the worst accuracy of 97.5{\%}.",

With the growing healthcare and wellbeing context aware applications, modeling security policies become an important issue in the design of future access control models. This requires rich semantics using ontology modeling for the management of services provided to dependant people. However, current access control models remain unsuitable due to lack of completeness, flexibility and adaptability to the user capability and behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptable access control model (UBC-ACM) and its related architecture (UBC-ACA) in which the security policy is based on the user's behavior and capability to grant a service using any assistive device within intelligent environment. The design of our model is an ontology-learning and evolving security policy for predicting the future actions of dependent people. This is reached by analyzing historical data, contextual data, and user behavior according to the access rules that are used in the inference engine to provide the right service according to the needs of users.",

abstract="Lifestyle and risk factors affect the development of diseases, cognitive decline and loss of autonomy during ageing. In the Italian Smart Health 2.0 project, we developed the SmartAging program offering innovative ICT solutions, grounded upon the Italian Telecom platform (``Nuvola Italian Home Doctor''), to contrast cognitive decline and support ``active'' ageing. Specifically, the SmartAging program includes tools for daily telemonitoring at subjects' home of: (i) eating behaviour, (ii) physical exercise, (iii) tobacco consumption, (iv) cultural, social and relational activities, (v) cognitive functions, (vi) weight, temperature, and blood pressure. Furthermore, a Point of Care device and a Self-Assessment Health Station (i.e. health medical equipment), in proximity to the subjects' home, allowed periodic measures of blood biomarkers and physiological indices. To demonstrate the feasibility of this program, we performed a clinical proof of concept study for 16 weeks on 10 elderly subjects (5 being oncological long-term survivors). All subjects expressed a need for education and assistance concerning a healthy lifestyle. Most of them expressed a preference for ICT-based home programs to improve the lifestyle over institutional programs. All expressed satisfaction with the SmartAging program in terms of simplicity, clarity, adequacy and reported a positive impact on their quality of life. These results suggest that the SmartAging program fulfills all the requirements to be considered an innovative technological approach for the lifestyle education and telemonitoring of seniors, to prevent dementing disorders. Some concepts of the SmartAging program have been further developing in the H2020-MSCA-ITN-ETN BBDiag project.",

abstract="Medical researchers are constantly looking for new methods for early detection and treatment of incurable diseases. Cancer can severely hinder the lives of patients if they are not constantly attended to. Cancer patients can be assisted with the aid of constant monitoring by a support group and a continual sense of self-awareness through monitoring, which can be enabled through pervasive technologies. As human life expectancy rises, incidents of cancer also increase, which most often affects the elderly. Cancer patients need continuous follow-up because of the state of their disease and the intensity of treatment. Patients have often restricted mobility, thus it is helpful to provide them access to their health status without the need to travel. There has been much effort towards wireless and internet based health care services, but they are not widely accepted due to the lack of reliability and usability. In this paper, we present a software called Wellness Monitor (WM). The purpose of WM is to utilize the portability and ubiquity of small handheld devices such as PDAs, cell phones, and wrist watches to ensure secured data availability, customized representation, and privacy of the data collected through small wearable sensors. WM explores how the social and psychological contexts that encompass the patients could be enhanced by utilizing the same technology, an aspect which is mostly unexplored.

abstract="Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces is a key component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote socialization in shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. In order to understand socializations in these shared spaces, surveillance systems must be developed to quantify the number and type of interactions in an environment. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using multiple cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an automatic behavioral mapping surveillance system designed for monitoring interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. Specific emphasis is given to the system designed to monitor the number, length and type of interactions of older adults in the community.",

abstract="Today integrated travel planning takes account of different transport modes, the current state of the transport system and to some extent the preferences of the user. Thus those systems are able to plan a travel as well as give advice during the travel. This chapter shows how to enhance the calculation model of an integrated travel planner to allow not only taking account the usage of vehicles but also the rest of infrastructures like station, including elevators, stairways, crossings, etc. Thus, it allows the creation of a travel planner that enables users using public transport in an intermodal personalized way, particularly those who are mentally or physically impaired. The testing area is in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in particular the area of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) transport authority.",

abstract="Nowadays, the human detection and response system brings convenience to people's daily life, and it also makes many applications of cyber-physical systems (CPS) to be possible. The traditional human detection and response systems always depend on some special devices, so that the prices of such systems are quite expensive. Considering that the widely-used smart phones are embedded many sensors, they provide a new way to construct a low-cost motion detection and response system. In this paper, a new architecture of the motion detection and response system is proposed based on smart phones, and the methods for detecting the human motion and responding accordingly are also given. Comparing with the traditional systems, the newly-proposed motion detection system is server-free and does not require any special devices. Moreover, the location-aware problem is also considered while designing the response module in the system.",

This people require effective treatment plans with clear goals, including pharmacological treatment, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and assessment tests, all of them according to the recommendations specified in Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) and centred on the patient. Moreover, these plans need to be adapted in a sensitive and responsive way to both the natural disease evolution and unexpected circumstances. This work presents an approach to automatically generate (from formal CPGs) and adaptively execute daily living care plans in the frame of a planning-based distributed architecture that allows for its application on AmI environments. This approach is based on temporal hierarchical planning and scheduling techniques, which allow for the context-awareness of the whole process.",

An evaluation was undertaken to discover if there were any `human errors' in completing the paper ADL and also looked for similarities/differences through using the digital ADL. We also analyzed the variability of the decisions made by all subjects. Results illustrate that 22 participants agreed that the digital ADL is better, if not the same as a paper based ADL. Further positives include the added benefit of the digital ADL being easy to use and also that the final calculation is done automatically.",

abstract="The aging process typically requires personalized care services for each individual. In this context, a collaborative elderly care ecosystem can support the provision of integrated services that may combine contributions from multiple providers. Through composition of services a personalized solution, tailored to the individual customer, respecting her/his requests, preferences, lifestyle, and constraints, can be achieved. An additional issue the ecosystem must deal with is the problem of evolution, as individual's care needs are not static over time. Consequently, the care services need to evolve accordingly to keep the elderly's requirements satisfied. This process of services' adaptation is challenging since many services can be dependent on each other, and there are various constraints that need to be observed before adaptating and enacting new services. In this paper, we exploit socio-technical aspects of service adaptation in the context of elderly care ecosystems. Starting with a service personalization method previously proposed, we introduce various cases of evolution of elderly care services in response to new requirements. The method considers customer's inputs and suggests evolution plans based on the MAPE-K methodology. An application example is then introduced to illustrate the approach.",

abstract="The multi-sensor fusion can provide more accurate and reliable information compared to information from each sensor separately taken. Moreover, the data from multiple heterogeneous sensors present in the medical surveillance systems have different degrees of uncertainty. Among multi-sensor data fusion techniques, Bayesian methods and evidence theories such as Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), are commonly used to handle the degree of uncertainty in the fusion processes. Based on a graphic representation of the DST called evidential networks, we propose a structure of heterogeneous multi-sensor fusion for falls detection. The proposed Evidential Network (EN) can handle the uncertainty present in a mobile and a fixed sensor-based remote monitoring systems (fall detection) by fusing them and therefore increasing the fall detection sensitivity compared to the a separated alone system.",

abstract="Behavior change indicates continuous decline in physical, cognitive and emotional status of elderly people. Early detection of behavior change is major enabler for service providers to adapt their services and improve the quality of life of elderly people. Nowadays, existing psychogeriatric scales and questionnaires are insufficient to observe all possible changes at a daily basis. Therefore, we propose a technological approach for behavior change detection, that employs unobtrusive ambient technologies to follow up elderly people over long periods. In fact, we study significant behavior change indicators (e.g., sleep impairments, visits and go out) and investigate statistical techniques that distinguish transient and continuous changes in monitored behavior. Furthermore, we present a preliminary validation of our approach through results based on correlations between our technological observations and medical observations of two-year nursing home deployment.",

The term ``Ambient Intelligence'' refers to this technology and emphasizes the incorporation of local intelligence to computing components. Ambient Intelligence is a huge field that goes from the acquisition of data from the environment, to fusioning the gathered information and data, to extracting situation characteristics, and to finally selecting and providing adequate information and services based on the extracted context.

On the other hand, nowadays there are a lot of electronic devices that allow people to perform everyday activities in a fast and easy way. Considering these premises, the automated control of electronic devices through mobile devices has emerged as a new challenge, whose main goal is to improve the quality of life of people. In this work, we present HomeR, a system that allows people, including people with disabilities, to manage smart home appliances through a mobile application. This system uses the Arduino and Raspberry Pi technologies to provide a low-cost solution that can be used by people independently of their status and abilities. HomeR was evaluated in terms of its implementation cost and accessibility. The results show that HomeR can be implemented in real environments with a low investment compared to already available solutions in Ecuador.",

Players, who ``work'' in the village, need to trade-off the time spent on administrative tasks (which enable them to earn extra income) against the time spent ensuring the welfare of the residents. The scenario of the game is complex enough to support the investigation of the influence of various factors, such as system accuracy, type of error made by the system, and risk associated with events, on players' trust in the monitoring system.

This paper presents results of a user study (N=12) with elderly people (62 - 70 years) to evaluate different modalities for attracting attention. Results show that actions which involve sound generate the fastest reaction times and are better perceived by participants. Surprisingly attempting to attract attention by establishing eye-contact resulted in worse participants' perception. We interpret these results as that robot gazing behaviour is better suited for situations in which the user's focus of visual attention is already on the robot.",

abstract="This paper introduces the Adopted-Pet (AP) protocol, an automatic (i.e. requiring no human interaction) secure pairing protocol, adequate for the pairing between a passive RFID tag and a reader. Most pairing protocols rely for their security on a certain advantage that the legitimate devices have over any malicious users. Such advantages include proximity (employing near-field communication) or secret keys that are either produced with the assistance of, or verified by, the legitimate user. The advantage exploited by our novel AP protocol is the amount of uninterrupted time spent by the two devices in the proximity (although not requiring near-field communication) of each-other. We discuss several implementation configurations, all based on pseudo-random bit generators, employing short-length LFSRs, and requiring no more than 2000 transistors. This makes the protocol ideally suited for low-cost passive RFID tags. For each configuration we show that the AP protocol is highly secure against occasional malicious entities.",

abstract="The phenomenon of an aging society has derived problems such as shortage of medical resources, rising healthcare costs and reduction of quality in healthcare services. Pervasive healthcare aims to alleviate these problems, but many issues remain to be resolved. This paper presents a system called CARA (Context Aware Real-time Assistant) whose design goals are to address these issues in a pervasive long-term healthcare solution. CARA aims to provide efficient healthcare services by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. This system can continuously measure physiological signals, and either store the data on the server or stream the data to a remote location in real-time. A design goal of ubiquitous access has prompted the design of the system as a rich internet application. The only tool required is a web browser with the commonly-available Adobe Flash plug-in installed. Thus the system enables access and analysis on any internet-connected PC or appropriate smart device, independent of geographic location. The remote monitoring and data review applications of CARA are presented at as the main implementation examples. The results of experiments using the system are presented.",

With an audio-visual attention control system, the robot automatically directs attention to a speaker by fusion of visual and auditory features. We conducted a user study involving experiential interaction with the robot, which oriented its display in the direction of the user's voice, and also tracked the user's face once it is in view of the robot's camera. A questionnaire was given to gather the opinions of the participants regarding the usability of the robot for the elderly, and their responses indicate a positive attitude, acceptance, and trust towards the attention-directed robot. By comparing the responses of subjects with different levels of video-conferencing experience, we found that subjects who video-conference more frequently tend to be more accepting of the robot. Furthermore, they indicated an acceptable price of the robot as less than the price of a tablet, and most of them expressed the desire to buy the robot in the near future.",

In this paper, we model behavior patterns as usual activity start times. We introduce a Frequent Pattern Mining algorithm to estimate probable start times and their variations due to context conditions using only one single scan of the activity data stream. Experimentation using the Aruba CASAS and the ContextAct@A4H datasets and comparison with a Gaussian Mixture Model show our proposition provides adequate results for smart home environments domains with a lower computational time complexity.

Chronic diseases generally do not come with a cure, which require long-term supervision, monitoring, and various treatments that necessitate coordination among medical professionals. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) may help improve such process and be able to facilitate diverse clinical decision-making processes. In an attempt to achieve improved and evidence based care, we propose to make the connection between patients and clinicians using relevant standards. In the approach, patients collect relevant medical data periodically using personalized mobile healthcare system (PMHS) and share the data with clinical institutions to be compliant with the meaningful use of medical records. The collected medical data and measurement results are analyzed and the analysis result may be used to come up with personalized recommendations for preventing healthy people to become chronic disease patient. The ontology focuses on organizing measurement results semantically. For semantic use of the collected medical records, we have used Prot{\'e}g{\'e}-OWL for building ontology and used SPARQL query to retrieve meaningful information from the patient-provided medical data.",

abstract="Increasing availability of sensor-based location traces for individuals, combined with the goal of better understanding user context, has resulted in a recent emphasis on algorithms for automatically extracting users' significant places from location data. Place-finding can be characterized by two sub-problems, (1) finding significant locations, and (2) assigning semantic labels to those locations (the problem of ``moving from location to place'') [8]. Existing algorithms focus on the first sub-problem and on finding city-level locations. We use a principled approach in adapting Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to provide a first solution for finding significant places within the home, based on the first set of long-term, precise location data collected from several homes. We also present a novel metric for quantifying the similarity between places, which has the potential to assign semantic labels to places by comparing them to a library of known places. We discuss several implications of these new techniques for the design of Ubicomp systems.",

IMS offers a group of common services which can be reused in different applications, and enable the running of the same application over any device, anywhere and anytime. We propose a conceptual implementation of AAL services through generic IMS services (service enablers), We also show the benefits they can offer in order to support a healthy and independent life on elderly people.",

abstract="Recently, Fuzzy Logic has been proposed as the most suitable approach for profitably tackling uncertainty and vagueness in clinical guidelines, and providing a new mobile generation of Decision Support Systems. This paper presents an intuitive XML-based language, named Fuzzy Decision Support Language, for both configuring a fuzzy inference system and encoding fuzzy medical knowledge to be embedded into a mobile DSS. Such a language enables the encoding of: i) fuzzy medical knowledge, in terms of groups of positive evidence rules and fuzzy ELSE rules assembling all the negative evidence for a specific situation; ii) input and output data, respectively elaborated or produced by the fuzzy DSS, in order to provide meaningful and semantically well-defined advices. As a proof of concept, the proposed language has been applied to encode, into a mobile DSS, the medical knowledge required to remotely detect suspicious situations of sleep apnea or heart failure in patients affected by cardiovascular diseases.",

abstract="The ``Daily Care Journal'' is a platform that aims at allowing a care taker to stay at home as long as possible. This should be achieved by providing means to build and coordinate care networks between professional and informal care givers, including the care taker. It allows the informal care to document their measures and observations. Additionally it provides care related information that might strengthen the informal care. Synchronized with a professional care information system it allows both, the professional and informal care givers, to exchange care related information with each other and to coordinate their activities. One key technology is the usage of a tablet pc that allows the care taker to document and to actively build and take part of his care network. The ``Daily Care Journal'' has been developed and evaluated together with a professional care provider.",

It profoundly influences how we look, feel, think, and act. If we want a computer to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have primitive instincts. In this paper, we will review the recent work in this area, the building blocks for the instinctive operating system, and potential applications. The paper proposes a 'bottom-up' approach that is focused on human basic instincts: forage, vigilance, reproduction, intuition and learning. They are the machine codes in human operating systems, where high-level programs, such as social functions can override the low-level instinct. However, instinctive computing has been always a default operation. Instinctive computing is the foundation of Ambient Intelligence as well as Empathic Computing. It is an essential part of Human Computing.",

abstract="The number of elderly people, who are unable to live independently and need assistance due to cognitive impairment, will rise rapidly in the aging society. To assist the independent living of these individuals and decrease the caregiver burden have become an important public health concern in the future. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive function and dementia. The symptoms of MCI include difficulty remembering recent events or recently acquired information, depression and anxiety. MCI also increases the fall risk and affects patients' social function and behavior. Sufficient physical activities can improve health of brain and reduce the risk of MCI. Since the context-aware computing technologies for assisting living have gained great popularity. We proposed a context-based activity prompting system to improve quality of life for MCI patients. The proposed system utilizes a smart phone as a sensor device to transmit sensing data to cloud server for activity recognition and activity level estimation, and uses context-based technique to provide activity prompting message to MCI patients. The activity prompting service supplies the activities self-management for MCI patients and helps them living independently. The system also provides real time fall detection mechanism to shorten the rescue time when accident happened. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed system achieves high accuracy on activity recognition and activity level estimation.",

abstract="Behavior recognition through ambient assisted living solutions for elderly people represents an ambitious challenge for actimetry. Numerous and versatile solutions have been deployed. However, a commercial adoption is still pending, due to scalability and acceptability constraints. Most research in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) appears to have a heavy design, where precise features are first selected, and hardware architecture is designed accordingly. Although it may provide interesting results, such approach leads to a lack of scalability. This is why we experimented a lighter approach for a real deployment. The complexity is shifted from hardware to software, and we aim to make meaningful information emerge from simple and generic sensor data, in order to recognize abnormal and dangerous situations. In this paper, we will describe how to retrieve consistent information, so that residents' behaviors may be observed. This work might serve as a proof of concept that a light and generic approach fits in large scale deployments, with acceptable cost and scalability.",

pages="439--453",
abstract="Post-war neighborhoods all over Europe are facing various kinds of challenges in order to adapt them for use in the future. The predominant factor in many concepts of neighborhood refurbishment is the energy demand of the buildings. In connection, many research projects focus on the reduction of CO2 emissions, omitting the fact that this specific value does not have any immediate benefit for the residents themselves, neither on the psychological nor on the economic level. The sole positive effects can be found on the macroeconomic level, which rarely is calculated and most likely cannot be communicated as a benefit to the residents in a comprehensible fashion. This approach may lead to considerable resistance among the residents against ambitious redevelopment plans. The methodological approach presented in this paper reflects the establishment of a vision for a neighborhood-development strategy. Its core is an iterative process using the tools of questionnaires, workshops and focus-group discussions, which involves the owners of the buildings, the local energy provider, policy makers, representation of the residents and research experts. The methodological framework was developed based on the reference neighborhood Itzling, which is situated in the city of Salzburg/Austria. It is an urban area with mostly social housing erected between 1966 and 1976, which houses approximately 2500 inhabitants. The singular priorities of this neighborhood's refurbishment plans were harmonized in the form of a questionnaire and multiple workshops. As a result of this process, five key areas of action (energy, living space, open space, social and mobility) were identified. The developed iterative process is multipliable and transferrable to comparable urban areas that share a set of similarities. It is the basis for future decisions and gives orientation to the building owners, the energy provider and policy makers. Besides the methodology, the outcomes of this process are a poster, a folder and a detailed catalog of measures. The poster and the folder visualize the neighborhood development strategy. A set of characters, icons and photos including easily comprehensible comics was developed. These design features are important in order to create a recognition value and to stimulate acceptance among the inhabitants of the neighborhood. Moreover, the low-threshold approach of the design facilitates future communication with the concerned public. The described methodology of the neighborhood-development strategy guarantees the inclusion of all stakeholders and supports a prioritization of future measures that can lead to a more energy-efficient and livable development of neighborhoods in need of adaptation.",

A prototype system enabling the participants to observe automated features of an AAL system as well as to perform basic interaction and communication tasks was installed. Periodic evaluation cycles that were accompanying the project which were based on a customized mix of methods and concepts frequently discussed and applied in the context of AAL research. The main concepts used are the technology acceptance model (TAM), contextual design and the analysis of social networks. The project is still up and running, but first results could already be achieved which show a different access to technology between men and women.",

abstract="Pervasive computing is allowing healthcare to move from care by professionals in hospital to self-care, mobile care, and at-home care. The pervasive healthcare system, CARA(Context Aware Real-time Assistant), is designed to provide personalized healthcare services for chronic patients in a timely and appropriate manner by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. This paper presents a fuzzy-logic based context model and a related context-aware reasoning middleware that provides a personalized, flexible and extensible reasoning framework for CARA. It provides context-aware data fusion and representation as well as inference mechanisms that support remote patient monitoring and caregiver notification. Noteworthy about the work is the use of fuzzy-logic to deal with the imperfections of the data, and the use of both structure and hierarchy to control the application of rules in the context reasoning system.",

abstract="By their very nature, Intelligent Environments (IE's) are infused with complexity, unreliability and uncertainty due to a combination of sensor noise and the human element. The quantity, type and availability of data to model these applications can be a major issue. Each situation is contextually different and constantly changing. The dynamic nature of the implementations present a challenging problem when attempting to model or learn a model of the environment. Training data to construct the model must be within the same feature space and have the same distribution as the target task data, however this is often highly costly and time consuming. There can even be occurrences were a complete lack of labelled target data occurs. It is within these situations that our study is focussed. In this paper we propose a framework to dynamically model IE's through the use of data sets from differing feature spaces and domains. The framework is constructed using a novel Fuzzy Transfer Learning (FuzzyTL) process.",

abstract="Context-aware applications rely on implicit forms of input, such as sensor-derived data, in order to reduce the need for explicit input from users. They are especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing environments, in which user attention is at a premium. To support the development of context-aware applications, techniques for modelling context information are required. These must address a unique combination of requirements, including the ability to model information supplied by both sensors and people, to represent imperfect information, and to capture context histories. As the field of context-aware computing is relatively new, mature solutions for context modelling do not exist, and researchers rely on information modelling solutions developed for other purposes. In our research, we have been using a variant of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to model context. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences and outline some research challenges in this area.",

The important issue in deployment is the noninvasiveness. That is, the user should not feel inconvenience. Therefore, our system has been developed by making use of FSR sensors and an optional small body-activity sensor. In particular, FSR sensor is a typical noninvasive sensor since it has a shape of film. In order to make a light-weight monitoring system, we use as small number of sensors as possible. And we adopt rule-based ADL inferring algorithms to avoid inconvenience in collecting training data for supervised learning. For the purpose of improving the accuracy of occupation/usage detection, we make FSR sensors into FSR array sensors. We evaluate the proposed system in laboratory and real home environment.",

Especially, for the at-home monitoring, the demand of which is increasing, not only close observation, but also accurate behavior recognition of daily living activity, as well as motor function evaluation, are necessary. In this study, such a system was established by developing a cost-effective, safe and easy to use mobile robot. With such a robotic monitoring system, the in-hospital time for most MIPs and the burden to therapists can be significantly decreased. In order to realize the robotic monitoring system, we proposed several algorithms to solve the difficulties arising from the mobile sensing for moving MIPs, and recognize several frequent daily living activities, including impaired walking. Concretely, algorithms to use both color images and depth images was proposed to improve the accuracy of MIPs measurement, and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was implemented to deal with the uncertainty on time sequence data and relate the state transitions over time for daily living activity recognition. Experiments have demonstrated promising results on joint trajectory measurement, and recognition of daily living activities.",

abstract="Using service robots at home is becoming more and more popular in order to help people in their life routine. Such robots are required to do various tasks, from user notification to devices manipulation. However, in such complex environments, robots sometimes fail to achieve one task. Failing is problematic as it is unpleasant for the user and may cause critical situations. Therefore, understanding and preventing failures is a challenging need. In this paper, we propose LEAF, an experience based approach to prevent task failure. LEAF relies on both semantic context knowledge through ontology and user validation, allowing LEAF to have an accurate understanding of failures. It then uses this new knowledge to adapt a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) in order to prevent selecting tasks that have a high risk of failure in the plan. LEAF was tested in the Hadaptic platform and evaluated using a randomly generated dataset.",

abstract="In this research we examine the influence of technical expertise on future medical technology. Technical expertise is assumed to positively influence the acceptance of modern technologies, and there is evidence within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector for this. While no one would seriously dispute this basic impact of technical expertise on technology acceptance, it is far from clear what the main drivers of technical expertise are. In order to understand the complex nature of expertise on the one hand and its impact on the acceptance of other technology domains on the other, an empirical approach was undertaken. 100 participants (19-75 years) participated in a survey, in which the acceptance of a medical mobile device was explored. Outcomes show (1) that technical expertise is a highly complex construct entailing different facets (knowledge, motivational, emotional and pragmatic components), which are influenced by age and gender of respondents (2) technical expertise in the ICT domain decisively modulates acceptance of medical technology. Interestingly, a low technical expertise does not only reduce the acceptance of the pro-using arguments, but is specifically related to a high confirmation of contrausing arguments.",

abstract="We have developed an approach for whole-house gross movement and room transition detection through sensing at only one point in the home. We consider this system to be one member of an important new class of human activity monitoring approaches based on what we call infrastructure mediated sensing, or ``home bus snooping.'' Our solution leverages the existing ductwork infrastructure of central heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems found in many homes. Disruptions in airflow, caused by human inter-room movement, result in static pressure changes in the HVAC air handler unit. This is particularly apparent for room-to-room transitions and door open/close events involving full or partial blockage of doorways and thresholds. We detect and record this pressure variation from sensors mounted on the air filter and classify where certain movement events are occurring in the house, such as an adult walking through a particular doorway or the opening and closing of a particular door. In contrast to more complex distributed sensing approaches for motion detection in the home, our method requires the installation of only a single sensing unit (i.e., an instrumented air filter) connected to an embedded or personal computer that performs the classification function. Preliminary results show we can classify unique transition events with up to 75-80{\%} accuracy.",

Depth sensor-based HAR recognizes human activities using features from depth human silhouettes via classifiers such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Conditional Random Fields Model etc. In this paper, we propose a new HAR system via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of deep learning algorithms. We extract joint angles from multiple body joints changing in time and create a spatiotemporal feature matrix (i.e., multiple body joint angles in time). With these derived features, we train and test our CNN for HAR. In order to evaluate our system, we have compared the performance of our CNN-based HAR against the HMM- and Deep Belief Network (DBN)-based HAR using a database of Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Our test results show that the proposed CNN-based HAR is able to recognize twelve human activities reliably and it outperforms the HMM- and DBN-based systems. We have achieved the average recognition accuracy of 98.59{\%} for the activities. The results are 6.1{\%} more accurate than that of the HMM-based HAR and 1.05{\%} more accurate than that of the DBN-based HAR.",

It is deeply grounded on voice interaction and represents a Spoken Language System (SLS) meant to be a sort of intelligent assistant with which the users can vocally interact. The paper dwells on an experimental assessment of the system. Linear regression analysis have been carried out in order to assess the influence of system performance---in terms of dialogue efficiency metrics and dialogue quality metrics---on the perceived satisfaction of users. Results show that longer dialogues are preferred in order to positively influence the users satisfaction, suggesting the importance for people to have time for getting confident with new ICT solutions. Moreover, from the experimental analysis, it clearly emerges how system intervention should be reduced, suggesting how a good balance between user and system turns represents an important aspect for a fluid interaction. The same can be speculated for dialogues with no met requests that also tended to be associated with lower satisfaction scores. These last results support the importance for a vocal assistant to be effective in its purpose in order to be perceived as useful and satisfying.",

abstract="Those suffering from mild dementia exhibit impairments of memory, thought and reasoning. It has been recognised that deployment of technological solutions to address such impairments may have a major positive impact on the quality of life and can be used to help perform daily life activities hence maintaining a level of independence. In this paper we present an overview of our current investigations into how technology can be used to improve the quality of life of the ageing person with mild dementia. Specifically, we detail the methodology adopted for our work, outline results attained from a series of workshops to identify user needs and finally present how these user needs have been mapped onto the design of home based assistive technologies.",

abstract="In recent years, activity recognition has attracted extensive attention and been applied in many areas including smart home, healthcare, energy saving, etc. A number of approaches for activity recognition have been proposed. However, the dispersion of values of run sensors imposes negative effect on activity recognition. In this paper, an approach based on value revision is proposed to recognize the activities of a resident. First, the time and the total duration that each sensor is run are calculated as sensor attributes in an activity record. Second, the start time, end time and duration of an activity record are extracted from a set of activity records as activity attributes. Third, the information gains of attributes are calculated to filter attributes which have low the information gains. Fourth, values of attributes of tested activity records are replaced with the most similar values of attributes of activity records of training dataset. Finally, classifiers are exploited to recognize daily activities. This paper validates the recognition of daily activities in two datasets by comparing the proposed approach and a previous approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach favourably outperforms previous approach.",

Given an RDF dataset of primitive observations, our aim is to identify, link and classify meaningful contexts that signify the presence of complex activities, coupling background knowledge pertinent to generic contextual dependencies among activities. To this end, we use the Situation concept of the DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL) ontology to formally capture the context of high-level activities. Moreover, we use context similarity measures to handle the intrinsic characteristics of pervasive environments in real-world conditions, such as missing information, temporal inaccuracies or activities that can be performed in several ways. We illustrate the performance of the proposed framework through its deployment in a hospital for monitoring activities of Alzheimer's disease patients.",

TRiCmini+ can be separated into the ``brain (a tablet)'' and the ``body (the robotic vehicle)''. With this structure, the robot control software is an App which can be downloaded, maintained and updated easily through the Internet. TRiCmini+ is integrated with social network services such as Google Talk and Facebook, to provide a wide range of communication and information sharing easily and conveniently. The effectiveness of using TRiCmini+ in communication is evaluated.

Clustering by an autonomous mobile robot opens the possibility for monitoring older adults from the most appropriate positions, respecting their privacies, and adapting to various changes. Since the data that the robot observes is a data stream and communication network can be unreliable, the clustering method in this case should be onboard. Motivated by the rapid increase of older adults in number and the severe outcomes of their falls, we adopt Kinect equipped robots and focus on gait skeleton analysis for fall risk discovery. Our key contributions are new between-skeleton distance measures for risk discovery and two series of experiments with our onboard clustering. The experiments revealed several key findings for the method and the application as well as interesting outcomes such as clusters which consist of unexpected risky postures.",

There were additional questions about how useful and easy to use they thought their robot would be. The dependent variables were attitudinal and intentional acceptance. The analysis of the responses of 117 older adults (aged 65-86) and 60 younger adults (aged 18-25) indicated that individuals thought of robots foremost as performance-directed machines, less so as social devices, and least as unproductive entities.

abstract="The residential sector accounts for approximately 27 and 17{\%} of the world energy consumption and its CO2 emission, respectively. Thus, developing measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in this sector, which is highly associated with the rapidly increasing proportion of world's urban population, is crucial to ensuring the sustainable development of the urban environment. However, the majority of the existing expertise on energy sustainability revolves around improving the thermal quality of the building envelop with lesser focus on the social and behavioural aspects of energy consumption. Given the importance of factors pertaining to the latter aspects, which are found to be responsible for 4--30{\%} of the variation in residential energy consumption, this paper aims to address and explore for the first time the impact of the UK residents' life-cycle evolution on their energy usage. To attain this, an official database encompassing around 5000 households observed over the course of 10 years was analysed with the help of specific statistical tests and procedures (e.g. logistic regression). First, logistic regression was employed to determine the socio-economic factors influencing households' evolution from one state to another; consequently, future evolutionary models covering a 10-year window, were predicted. This was followed by analysing the effect of the predicted evolutionary models on the households' gas and electricity usage patterns using point-biserial correlation. Finally, the findings suggest that households' evolution have a significant effect on their energy consumption patterns. However, the magnitude and the direction of this effect is weak and mostly positive, respectively.",

abstract="In this paper, we present an ontology-based approach in designing knowledge model for context recognition (CR) systems. The main focus in this paper is on the use of an ontology to facilitate the generation of user-based queries to the CR system. By leveraging from the ontology, users need not know about sensor details and the structure of the ontology in expressing queries related to events of interest. To validate the approach and demonstrate the flexibility of the ontology for query generation, the ontology has been integrated in two separate application domains. The first domain considers a health care system implemented for the GiraffPlus project where the query generation process is automated to request information about activities of daily living. The second application uses the same ontology for an air quality monitoring application in the home. Since these two systems are independently developed for different purposes, the ease of applying the ontology upon them can be considered as a credit for its generality.",

The system can also be deployed in ambulances to equip them with health monitoring technologies. The system is designed to be used by elderly, diabetics, muscular and neurological patients who are likely to fall, in addition to heart patients who are probable to get heart attacks causing falls. This project aims to provide users and their families with a sense of mental and physical security in their houses. It will also help them pass through the abstraction of money, since they will not need costly home care nursing services, and they will enjoy relief without having an observer, hence providing a significant socioeconomic impact. The system has three main features: (1) Sensing data gathered from the accelerometer and Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes embedded in the Shimmer sensing device; (2) Real time monitoring and alerting system; and (3) Medical logging consists of time, position, strength, and location of the fall. The real-time classification of the fall detection has been achieved with an accuracy of 90{\%} using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Moreover, the KNN hardware implementation requires 48{\%} of Look-Up Tables (LUTs) and 22{\%} of Flip-Flops (FFs) available on the Zedboard while consuming 582 Mw.",

abstract="The presented approach solves the problem of organizing a well-structured dialogue between a smartwatch wearer and a health assistance app running on the smartwatch. Especially for emergency situations, when the app has concluded the presence of several threatening health or security hazards. Such situations require an effective, joint handling of all acute health and security hazards in one combined dialogue. Otherwise, the domain specific knowledge for concluding present hazards has been isolated deliberately into separate units for efficient maintenance and comprehensibility. It is represented in a declarative way by finite state machines. A multitude of such finite state machines will be executed simultaneously in the app for monitoring all relevant potential health and/or security hazards. Furthermore, the tactical knowledge for dialogue handling of concluded hazards is represented independently from the domain specific knowledge by ``critical dialogue sections'', CDSs. A CDS has an internal activity structure for controlling the dialogue with the smartwatch wearer in order the handle the concluded hazard. During the execution of a CDS, the smartwatch I/O and communication devices are exclusively attached to the CDS. Effective handling of such concluded hazards does typically include to establish a speech connection with distant family members or a home emergency call center. This can be achieved via the integrated cellular phone of the smartwatch. The selection of the situationally most appropriate hazard for handling is done via a central scheduler utilizing a blackboard. Our application framework relieves the software developer from dealing with the details and obstacles of effective dialogue implementation and allows to focus on the domain specific knowledge and handling logic of the assistance app.",

A coordinator agent proposes a new planning model, where the complex processes are modeled as external services. The agent acts as coordinators of Web services that implement the four stages of the case-based planning cycle. One of the main aims of the pervasive systems is to be able to adapt themselves in execution time to the changes in the number of resources available, the mobility of the users, variability in the needs of the users and failures of the system.

abstract="We describe stroke patients' activity patterns and trends based on motion data acquired during their stay in an ambulatory day-care centre. Our aim was to explore and quantify intensity and development in the patients' activity patterns as these may change during the rehabilitation process. We analyse motion data recordings from wearable inertial measurement units of eleven patients up to eleven days, totally 102 recording days. Using logic rules, we extract activity primitives, including affected arm move, sit, stand, walking, etc. from selected channels of the continuous median-filtered sensor data. Using relative duration of the activity primitives, we examine patient activity patterns regarding independence in mobility, distribution of walking over the days and trends in using the affected body side. Due to the heterogeneity of patients' behaviour, we focused on analysing patient-specific activity patterns. Our exploration showed that the rule-based activity primitive analysis is beneficial to understand individual patient activity.",

In this paper, we propose a framework that can support impromptu service discovery and context-aware service access with mobile devices in heterogeneous assistive environments. Different from the existing approaches, the framework requires no specialized hardware or software installation in mobile client devices, it can automatically generate personalized user interfaces based on context such as user preference and device capability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we prototyped a set of assistive services in public spaces like shopping malls, leveraging the OSGi-based platform accessible from any WLAN enabled mobile devices.",

Different methods are employed to understand the adoption of AmI appliances by users. However, these are often small-scale methods that are focused on specific subgroups. Large scale quantitative studies to understand the adoption of AmI appliances are scarce. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to examine how the Dutch people (n = 1221) perceive AmI appliances for domestic settings. Findings show that intention to adopt AmI appliances was low and that respondents had a negative to neutral attitude towards AmI appliances. On the basis of structural equation analysis, results suggest that adoption of AmI appliances could be explained by outcome expectancies of AmI appliances. The potential implications of the findings are discussed.",

abstract="Data Stream Management (DSM) addresses the continuous processing of sensor data. DSM requires the combination of stream operators, which may run on different distributed devices, into stream processes. Due to the recent advantages in sensor technologies and wireless communication, the amount of information generated by DSM will increase significantly. In order to efficiently deal with this streaming information, Digital Library (DL) systems have to merge with DSM systems. Especially in healthcare, the continuous monitoring of patients at home (telemonitoring) will generate a significant amount of information stored in an e-health digital library (electronic patient record). In order to stream-enable DL systems, we present an integrated data stream management and Digital Library infrastructure in this work. A vital requirement for healthcare applications is however that this infrastructure provides a high degree of reliability. In this paper, we present novel approaches to reliable DSM within a DL infrastructure. In particular, we propose information filtering operators, a declarative query engine called MXQuery, and efficient operator checkpointing to maintain high result quality of DSM. Furthermore, we present a demonstrator implementation of the integrated DSM and DL infrastructure, called OSIRIS-SE. OSIRIS-SE supports flexible and efficient failure handling to ensures complete and consistent continuous data stream processing and execution of DL processes even in the case of multiple failures.",

The offered user interfaces for these ICT solutions often do not take the special needs, preferences and the physical and mental capabilities of older adults into account. The project AALuis focuses on solutions to increase accessibility, adaptability and usability of user interfaces in the AAL domain. The paper describes the functionality of the AALuis layer and the different steps involved stakeholders have to cover to benefit from the user interface generation framework. A detailed comparison between the traditional user interface design and the AALuis approach lists similarities and identifies differences in the user interface generation process.",

abstract="Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be taken as one of the principal test beds for the integration of Systems, Humans and Cybernetics. Multi-agent based Ambient Intelligence solutions have proliferated in the last few years in order to cope with the intrinsically distributed and complex interaction based nature of the problem. Different multi-agent platforms have been used in this regard, being JADE one of the standard solutions adopted due the variety of services it provides and to its FIPA compliance. Nevertheless, JADE was designed as a general Multi-agent platform and not for the particular demands of AmI systems. Consequently, its behavior in this realm is not as optimal as it could be. In this paper, we analyze some of the problems JADE presents for its application to AmI, especially in terms of communications, and describe some of the extensions we have developed in order to solve them. The resulting system exhibits enhanced communication capabilities, promotes the division of tasks into decoupled components and makes component reutilization easy. This platform constitutes an environment with tools for the development and deployment of AmI applications.",

abstract="Maintaining user privacy is a well-known challenge and obstacle to the acceptance of pervasive computing. Privacy has been researched from various perspectives by social science, legislative, and technological communities resulting in an information-centric approach that regulates of the collection and use of personal information. However, through the actuation of devices and objects in the user's physical environment, pervasive computing also introduces other significant challenges to a user's physical privacy. Our research introduces an environment-centric approach to modeling user privacy and regulating intrusions to physical privacy. We introduce four principles to guide the construction of physical privacy policies and demonstrate how existing information privacy models can be extended to address these aspects of physical privacy.",

Therefore our system provides a cooking advisor, which is able to recognize the available food and respecting those presents the user a list of recipes, which fit his available ingredients and also his nutritional needs. If he wishes, he has also the possibility to set other filter parameters. Additionally the cooked menus are logged by the system and may be subject to further analyses. For determining the available ingredients our system uses RFID technology and also provides the user some community-like features for submitting new receipts or new ingredients.",

Understanding individual arguments and to reach a high usage rate of these vehicles in the public and a broad acceptance, the identification of possible pro-using motives as well as perceived drawbacks is essential, which would allow a sensitive and individually-tailored communication and information policy. Using an exploratory approach, a questionnaire study was carried out in which participants were requested to indicate the level of acceptance and the intention to use electric cars. The questionnaire items were taken from several focus groups, which had been carried out prior to the questionnaire study. Outcomes show that the traditional car is perceived still as much more comfortable, and receives a high trustfulness in comparison to electric cars. In addition, user diversity in terms of age and gender was found to considerably the perceived benefits and barriers. Female users but also aged persons show a higher level of acceptance, which might be due to their higher environmental consciousness in contrast to male persons and younger participants. Interestingly, the self-reported level of domain knowledge (significantly higher in men) did not show a large influence on the level of acceptance.",

Twenty one antennas were placed under mats and five residents wore slippers into which Radio Frequency IDentification(RFID) tags were inserted. We collected location data for thirty months and looked for long term tendencies in their activities. We found that the information concerning their whereabouts may indicate their waning health conditions and may reflect caregivers' treatment. We also found a seasonal effect on residents' mobilities, a decline in summer. The result shows that location data may be exploited as a valuable source to recognize residents' slowly changing conditions.",

abstract="Ambient agents react on humans on the basis of partial information obtained by sensoring. Appropriate types of reactions depend on in how far an ambient agent is able to interpret the available information (which is often incomplete, and hence multi-interpretable) in order to create a more complete internal image of the environment, including humans. This interpretation process, which often has multiple possible outcomes, can make use of an explicitly represented model of causal and dynamic relations. Given such a model representation, the agent needs a reasoning method to interpret the partial information available by sensoring, by generating one or more possible interpretations. This paper presents a generic model-based default reasoning method that can be exploited to this end. The method allows the use of software tools to determine the different default extensions that form the possible interpretations.",

Constructive induction has been used to improve learning accuracy through transforming the primitive representation of data into a new one where regularities are more apparent.

Meanwhile, the central component of an interactive system, the dialogue manager, has been developed according to a unified dialogue modelling method, which combines the conventional recursive transition network based generalized dialogue models and the classic agent-based dialogue theory, and supported by a formal language based development toolkit. In order to evaluate the minutely developed multimodal interactive system, the touch and speech input modalities of the current system were evaluated by an elaborated experimental study with altogether 31 elderly. The overall positive results on the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of both modalities confirm our proposed guidelines, approaches and frameworks on interactive system development. Despite the slightly different results, there is no significant evidence for one preferred modality. Thus, further study of their combination is considered necessary.",

The literature suggests the adoption of wearable devices, relying on acceleration information to model the activities of interest and distance metrics for the comparison of such models with the run-time data. Most current solutions do not explicitly model the uncertainty associated with the recognition, but rely on crisp thresholds and comparisons which introduce brittleness and inaccuracy in the system. We propose a framework for the recognition of simple activities in which recognition uncertainty is modelled using possibility distributions. We show that reasoning about this explicitly modelled uncertainty leads to a system with enhanced recognition accuracy and precision.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a noninvasive sensor system for discriminating mobility pattern of a resident on the bed without inconvenience. The proposed system consists of a thin and wide film style of piezoelectric force senor, a signal processing board, and data collecting program. There are four different types of motion that were simulated by non-patient volunteers. About 10,000 experimental motions of subjects were performed. Sensor data by human motions were collected and preprocessed by a moving average filter, transformed by FFT, and classified by the k-NN algorithm with k = 1. The experiment yielded the overall discrimination rate of 89.4 {\%}. The proposed system will contribute to differentiating mobility pattern on a bed and distinguishing the physical characteristics of a person.",

abstract="In order to be accepted by users, one of the most important requirement for any assisted living technology is unobtrusiveness. This is particularly true when this technology is intended for continuous monitoring of vital signs, since traditional approaches require the subject to be tethered to measurement devices. The radar sensing is a very promising technology, enabling the measurement of vital signs at a distance, and thus meeting both requirements of unobtrusiveness and accuracy. In particular, impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar has attracted considerable attention in recent years thanks to many properties that make it useful for assisted living purposes. The aim of this paper is to investigate such radar technology for vital signs monitoring in assisted living scenarios. An algorithmic framework for the detection of respiration and heart rates during various activities of daily living is presented, including a method for compensation of movements of both the monitored subject and a second person present in the same environment (e.g., family member, caregiver, etc.). Experiments are carried out in various conditions that can be frequently encountered in assisted living scenarios. The reported results show that vital signs can be detected also while carrying out ADLs, with accuracy varying according to the level of movements and kind of involved body's parts and postures.",

abstract="In the presented system to person fall detection a body-worn accelerometer is used to indicate a potential fall and a ceiling-mounted depth sensor is utilized to authenticate fall alert. In order to expand the observation area the depth sensor has been mounted on a pan-tilt motorized head. If the person acceleration is above a preset threshold the system uses a lying pose detector as well as examines a dynamic feature to authenticate the fall. Thus, more costly fall authentication is not executed frame-by-frame, but instead we fetch from a circular buffer a sequence of depth maps acquired prior to the fall and then process them to confirm fall alert. We show that promising results in terms of sensitivity and specificity can be obtained on publicly available UR Fall Detection dataset.",

It will also raise an alarm when an anomalous behaviour is detected and will send a report to their relatives. Several methodologies have been proposed and implemented for carrying out the remote monitoring of the ADLS with every method having its own advantages and disadvantages.

Cases of dementia have also risen as the population gets older. Family members often live far apart and it is not unusual for them to be scattered in more than one country or continent. Memory loss associated with ageing (and amplified in cases of dementia) as well as a general feeling of isolation caused by distance can often lead elderly people to depression. We believe that, if used properly, technology could provide elders with powerful memory aids and social interaction tools that could improve their quality of life.

abstract="When it comes to user interaction elderly and people with special needs have special requirements, that evolve over time. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) envisions ubiquitous, intuitive human-machine interaction running on heterogeneous devices (tablets, televisions, smart-phones, etc.) and by means of multiple modalities (graphics, voice, gesture recognition, etc.). This vision often represents a strong technological challenge for any developer of AAL services. In order to relieve the developer from the burden of repeatedly adapting the interfaces, the universAAL platform [6] offers a framework for user interaction that separates the content, that is exchanged between the user and the application, and its actual representation. The main drawback of this solution is that it delegates all the responsibility of the representation of the content to the platform, which, in turn, must be able to adapt to all kinds of showable messages. This paper explains how a so-called UI Handler has been designed and implemented to render messages in universAAL, as well as the results of its technical and usability evaluations.",

abstract="Sleep problems can have a major impact on cognitive function, particularly in older adults who are also more likely to have a clinically diagnosed cognitive impairment. While several approved methods for sleep disturbance exist, most are not suitable for use within the abovementioned population. Often the reason for this is due to the symptoms associated with cognitive impairment or for the invasiveness of some sleep profiling methods. Developed from current sleep actigraphy techniques, this paper presents a non-contact alternative method for sleep profiling that is deemed to be more suitable for long term monitoring in the older population than current clinically approved techniques. This first evaluation has been conducted with a young control group in order to validate the approach. The results have demonstrated that based on the approach a random forest classifier using features calculated from optimally placed static accelerometers can produce a sleep/wake classification accuracy of 92{\%}.",

abstract="The emergency management offers a collection of methods, strategies and frameworks how to efficiently solve particular emergency situation for saving human lives with minimum spending time. Fast and faultless decision making is inevitable in these situations. This requires huge amount of theoretical and practical experience which can be gained during studying of particular courses, study programmes, or where we are directly confronted with a reality. Non-professionals have a problem to decide about the best sequence of steps which has to be applied if a particular emergency event occurs. The main aim of this text is to present the SWRL-based prototype for decision making if the first aid is necessary.",

abstract="An average human spends about one third of his life sleeping so quality of sleep is essential for the human being to maintain good physical and emotional health. Sleep disorders may introduce severe physical effects, e.g. cognitive impairments and mental health complications. So being able to measure and evaluate sleep behavior is important for health practitioners and the users themselves. In this paper, we present the implementation of the Sleep Lifestyle Reasoner part of AAL platform which allows detection of minor or major deviations in the sleeping patterns in MCI and COPD patients indicating changes in their health status. The output of the reasoner is fed to the My Sleep Web Application that provides recommendations to improve sleep hygiene and coaches the users into a healthy sleeping behavior, based on their personal rhythms and problems. It also supports the informal caregiver by providing insights on the sleeping behavior of the patient.",

abstract="Dynamically adaptive systems (DASs) are intended to monitor the execution environment and then dynamically adapt their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. The uncertainty of the execution environment is a major motivation for dynamic adaptation; it is impossible to know at development time all of the possible combinations of environmental conditions that will be encountered. To date, the work performed in requirements engineering for a DAS includes requirements monitoring and reasoning about the correctness of adaptations, where the DAS requirements are assumed to exist. This paper introduces a goal-based modeling approach to develop the requirements for a DAS, while explicitly factoring uncertainty into the process and resulting requirements. We introduce a variation of threat modeling to identify sources of uncertainty and demonstrate how the RELAX specification language can be used to specify more flexible requirements within a goal model to handle the uncertainty.",

abstract="Activity Recognition (AR) from smartphone sensors has become a hot topic in the mobile computing domain since it can provide services directly to the user (health monitoring, fitness, context-awareness) as well as for third party applications and social network (performance sharing, profiling). Most of the research effort has been focused on direct recognition from accelerometer sensors and few studies have integrated the audio channel in their model despite the fact that it is a sensor that is always available on all kinds of smartphones. In this study, we show that audio features bring an important performance improvement over an accelerometer based approach. Moreover, the study demonstrates the interest of considering the smartphone location for on-line context-aware AR and the prediction power of audio features for this task. Finally, another contribution of the study is the collected corpus that is made available to the community for AR recognition from audio and accelerometer sensors.",

abstract="We present a system for automatic annotation of daily experience from multisensory streams on smartphones. Using smartphones as platform facilitates collection of naturalistic daily activity, which is difficult to collect with multiple on-body sensors or array of sensors affixed to indoor locations. However, recognizing daily activities in unconstrained settings is more challenging than in controlled environments: 1) multiples heterogeneous sensors equipped in smartphones are noisier, asynchronous, vary in sampling rates and can have missing data; 2) unconstrained daily activities are continuous, can occur concurrently, and have fuzzy onset and offset boundaries; 3) ground-truth labels obtained from the user's self-report can be erroneous and accurate only in a coarse time scale. To handle these problems, we present in this paper a flexible framework for incorporating heterogeneous sensory modalities combined with state-of-the-art classifiers for sequence labeling. We evaluate the system with real-life data containing 11721 minutes of multisensory recordings, and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system for practical lifelogging applications.",

In this paper, we propose to employ an ontological representation for all the content both processed and produced by a DSS in answering requests. This semantic representation supports the DSS in the whole decisionmaking process, and it is capable of encoding (i) the request, (ii) the data relevant for it, and (iii) the conclusions/suggestions/decisions produced by the DSS. The advantages of using an ontology-based representation of the main data structure of a DSS are many: (i) it enables the integration of heterogeneous sources of data available in the web, and to be processed by the DSS, (ii) it allows to track, and to expose in a structured form to additional services (e.g., explanation or case reuse services), all the content processed and produced by the DSS for each request, and (iii) it enables to exploit logical reasoning for some of the inference steps of the DSS decision-making process.

abstract="Movement-based and exertion interfaces assume that their users move. Users have to perform exercises, they have to dance, they have to golf or football, or they want to train particular bodily skills. Many examples of those interfaces exist, sometimes asking for subtle interaction between user and interface and sometimes asking for `brute force' exertion interaction between user and interface. In these interfaces it is often the case that the interface mediates between players of a game. Obviously, one of the players may be a virtual human. We provide a `state of the art survey' of such interfaces and in particular look at intelligent exertion interfaces, interfaces that know about their users and even try to anticipate what their users prepare to do. That is, we embed this interface research in ambient intelligence and entertainment computing research, and the interfaces we consider are not only mediating, but they also `add' intelligence to the game. Other issues that will be discussed are `flow' and `engagement' for exertion interfaces. Intelligent exertion interfaces, being able to know and learn about their users, should also be able to provide means to keep their users engaged and in the flow of the game and entertainment experience. Unlike the situation with traditional desktop game research where we can observe lots of research activity trying to define, interpret and evaluate issues such as `flow' and `immersion', in movement-based interfaces these concepts need to be reconsidered and new ways of evaluation have to be defined.",

Its use with small scale sensors allows to collect and analyse vital data in real-time, triggering appropriate reactions in case of eminent danger. This includes real-time notifications to practitioners. In cases in which the physician is unable to divide his attention among all his patients, the system is able to drive his attention to one patient only and, when it is necessary, to another one, according to their medical state. This concept represents a breakthrough in terms of the physician's time and task management, being possible to apply it two major scenarios: patient recovery in a hospital environment or elderly living alone in a domestic environment.

abstract="This study assesses the accuracy of heart rate detection using custom fit intelligent garments with integrated textile electrodes. Two single lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) where recorded from 5 subjects using wet Ag/AgCl (WE) and textile electrodes (TE). During recording the subjects were asked to perform several tasks. Offline, the ECGs recorded from the WE were examined and the number of R wave peaks for each subject where counted by a human observer. This count served as the gold standard. A computer program was used to detect R peaks from both the WE and TE. Sensitivity of each system was determined by comparing computer program based heart rates from WE and TE to the gold standard. The system with TE obtained a mean sensitivity of 76.47{\%}. This was significantly lower than with WE (mean: 98.19{\%}). Results indicated that the custom skin layers did not perform accurately whilst performing tasks involving movement of the trunk and limbs.",

abstract="Our ultimate goal is to develop autonomous mobile home healthcare robots which closely monitor and evaluate the patients' motor function, and their at-home training therapy process, providing automatically calling for medical personnel in emergency situations. In our previous study, we developed basic algorithms for tracking, measuring, and behavior recognition of human subjects by a mobile robot, thus, demonstrated the feasibility of the idea of bio-monitoring home healthcare mobile robots. In this study, in order to realize effective bio-monitoring robots, we investigated 1) color based particle filter subject tracking with proposed depth likelihood integration to control the weights of particles; 2) control schemes for acquiring stable image sources for further human motion analysis, especially, the algorithms for reducing the camera vibration due to the acceleration and deceleration of the robot; 3) human activity recognition using contour data of the tracked human subjects extracted from depth images. Results showed that, depending on depth data can be quite useful as an observation by simplifying state space in 2D rather than 3D state space, and, a fuzzy control algorithm could decrease the vibration due to the acceleration and deceleration. Finally, the human activity recognition could be achieved with a high correct rate, by using geometric parameters extracted from contour data.",

abstract="Internet as place of everyday life, as well as a vast repository of information, becomes an integral part of the society essential for understanding complex phenomena and social issues. Social researchers cannot remain anchored to traditional research practices and conceptual categories, but instead must cope with the exponential growth of new data, much of which is user-generated and freely available online. In this manner, Web-mediated research is already transforming the way in which researchers practice traditional research methods transposed on the Web. But the steady growth of interest in these new analytical frontiers has not been properly accompanied by a solid reflection on the implications that the new data available and the analysis of such data can generate. It is necessary to undertake a critical discussion of the quality of this new data and the processes involved: data collection, organization, analysis, and treatment of ethical issues. Over the next years, this domain will raise the need of to much efforts in social research including the use of new methodological approaches. Along this track, the current chapter aims to problematize future challenges for social research, with a particular emphasis on the advent of big-new data.",

abstract="Social interaction is crucial for psychological wellbeing. However, for the elderly, desiring to live independently in their homes for as long as possible, getting the emotional care needed can become challenging. Robots as social companions may help. To design companions, we argue to focus on the hybrid nature of robots in between being a ``thing'' and a ``human'' thus utilizing the unique ``capabilities'' of a robot. We discuss six psychological superpowers of robots rooted in their ``thingness'' rather than ``humanness.'' Robots are void of competitiveness, have endless patience, can be unconditionally subordinated, have the ability to contain themselves, do not take things personally and can assume responsibility. These qualities all relate to everyday companionship, but may be difficult to actually realize for fellow humans. By exploiting these superpowers, robot companions can become meaningful -- not as a substitute for other humans, but as a novel, complementary form of social interaction.",

It is also the main obstacle to independent living for frail and elderly people. A reliable fall detector can reduce the fear of falling and provide the user with the reassurance to maintain an independent lifestyle since the reliable and effective fall detection mechanism will provide urgent medical support and dramatically reduce the cost of medical care. In this work, we propose a fall-detecting system based on a wearable sensor and a real-time fall detection algorithm. We use a waist- mounted tri-axial accelerometer to capture movement data of the human body, and propose a fall detection method that uses the area under a signal magnitude curve to distinguish between falls and daily activities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed scheme with high reliability and sensitivity on fall detection. The system is not only cost effective but also portable that fulfills the requirements of fall detection.",

abstract="Activity recognition performance is significantly dependent on the accuracy of the underlying activity model. Therefore, it is essential to examine and develop an activity model that can capture and represent the complex nature of human activities precisely. To address this issue, we introduce a new activity modeling technique, which utilizes simple yet often ignored activity semantics. Activity semantics are highly evidential knowledge that can identify an activity more accurately in ambiguous situations. We classify semantics into three types and apply them to generic activity framework, which is a refined hierarchical composition structure of the traditional activity theory. We compare the introduced activity model with the traditional model and the hierarchical models in terms of attainable recognition certainty. The comparison study shows superior performance of our semantic model using activities of daily living scenario.",

Developing robust mobility (or physical activity) monitoring systems relies on the automated algorithm that classifies GPS track points into events (such as stops where activities are conducted, and routes taken) accurately. This paper describes the method that automatically extracts community mobility measures from GPS track data. The method uses temporal DBSCAN in classifying track points, and temporal filtering in removing noises (any misclassified track points). The result shows that the proposed method classifies track points with 88{\%} accuracy. The percent of misclassified track points decreased significantly with our method (1.9{\%}) over trip/stop detection based on attribute threshold values (10.58{\%}).",

abstract="Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) consists of a large number of distributed sensor nodes. Wireless sensor networks are offering the next evolution in biometrics and healthcare monitoring applications. The present paper proposes a congestion control protocol based on the learning automata which prevents the congestion by controlling the source rate. Furthermore, a new active queue management mechanism is developed. The main objective of the proposed active queue management mechanism is to control and manage the entry of each packet to sensor nodes based on learning automata. The proposed system is able to discriminate different physiological signals and assign them different priorities. Thus, it would be possible to provide better quality of service for transmitting highly important vital signs. The simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol improves system throughput and reduces delay and packet dropping.",

The knowledge extracted by this analysis is used to create a model of normal electricity consumption behavior for each particular household. Initially, the household's electricity consumption data are partitioned into a number of clusters with similar daily electricity consumption profiles. The centroids of the generated clusters can be considered as representative signatures of a household's electricity consumption behavior. The proposed approach is evaluated by conducting a number of experiments on electricity consumption data of ten selected households. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is suitable for data organizing and understanding, and can be applied for modeling electricity consumption behavior on a household level.",

The developed system utilizes background domain knowledge about the user activities and the environment in combination with probabilistic reasoning methods in order to build best possible explanation of the observed stream of sensor events. The main advantage over traditional methods, e.g. dynamic Bayesian models, lies in the ability to deploy the solution in different environments without needing to undergo a training phase. To demonstrate this, tests with recorded data sets from two ambient intelligence labs have been conducted. The results show that even using basic semantic modeling of how the user behaves and how his/her behavior is reflected in the environment, it is possible to draw conclusions about the certainty and the frequencies with which certain activities are performed.",

Although powerful, when using BN we have to deal with the construction of the BN structure which happens to be a complex task because of the customized service offered by the DIY-AIDE system. To overcome this challenge, we developed the AAL-based Bayesian Network Construction Algorithm (AAL-BNCA). Through a case study, we show the operation mode of our framework and the performance of AAL-BNCA in diagnosing a system fault in a given assistance scenario.",

However, recognizing relevant human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data mining approaches. In this paper, we present a comparison study for HAR using features selection methods to reduce the training and classification time while maintaining significant performance. In fact, due to the limited resources of Smartphones, reducing the feature set helps reducing computation costs, especially for real-time continuous online applications. We validated our approach on a publicly available dataset to classify six different activities. Results show that Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm works well with Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine and significantly improves model building time without decreasing recognition performance.",

abstract="One of the most common electronic devices available in homes around the world is the TV. Its high utilization rate in domestic environments opens a series of possibilities to meet the most varied needs of its viewers. In this context, projects developed for specific audiences can take advantage of the opportunities offered by TV. +TV4E is a solution designed for the elderly, which aims to provide their inclusion by displaying informative contents on topics of their interest. Applications such as this are very relevant because they directly affect a considerable portion of the world's population. However, many of the features available in applications such as the +TV4E are inaccessible to people with physical disabilities since the main features available must be accessed through conventional remotes. New forms of interaction, based on the principles of Assistive Technology (AT), aim to enable people with physical disabilities to perform daily tasks in a more autonomous way. An example of an AT-based initiative is the IOM (Mouse-Eye Interface) project, which focuses on developing a device that functions as an alternative form of computer interaction, designed for people with motor disabilities in the upper limbs. In this context, this paper introduces IOM4TV, a software prototype that allows its users to control the +TV4E application through the IOM device. The article presents the proposed architecture, highlighting the main steps involved during the development of the solution. The paper also highlights the results obtained with the first round of prototype testing using two evaluation tools: SAM and AttrakDiff.",

There are many challenges to the application of DM in production operations, such as the incapacity of a supervisor at a work site to effectively implement the manufacturing-line model developed using a DM, in a planning operation. Therefore, we propose a system that makes it possible to redesign work plans and support improvement activity by simply inputting values in accustomed standardized work tables, namely, process capacity tables, standardized work tables, and standardized work combination tables, of three types of workers, instead of inputting a large quantity of complicated parameters. Less examination time is desirable at production sites, and we added a tool that enabled the graphical display of execution processes and results. Moreover, we added a system that made it possible to alter Microsoft Excel database inputs, such as the number or arrangement of DM processing machines.

abstract="Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology can provide users lacking voluntary muscle control with an augmentative communication channel, based on the interpretation of her/his brain activity. Such technologies, combined with AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) systems, can potentially have a great impact on daily living, extending the scope of the ageing at home paradigm also to individuals affected by severe motor impairments, for whom interacting with the environment is troublesome. In this paper, a low cost BCI development platform is presented; it consists of a customized EEG acquisition unit and a Matlab-based signal processing environment. An application example using SSVEP paradigm is discussed.",

abstract="In this paper, a localization system of mobile nodes in a ZigBee Home Automation (ZHA) network has been developed. We used the ZigBee wireless protocol for networking due to its low cost, low power consumption, and acceptable data rate for most of smart home control systems, compared to other existing alternatives like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or ZWave. Between the numerous localization techniques, we used the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which can be obtained without the inclusion of additional hardware to the ZigBee nodes. Our system was implemented with three different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which results are compared and analysed; with a series of data treatments to avoid communications errors between the nodes and RSSI values fluctuations.",

abstract="Technology acceptance has become a key concept for the successful rollout of technical devices. Though the concept is intensively studied for nearly 20 years now, still, many open questions remain. This especially applies to technology acceptance of older users, which are known to be very sensitive to suboptimal interfaces and show considerable reservations towards the usage of new technology. Mobile small screen technology increasingly penetrates health care and medical applications. This study investigates impacts of aging, technology expertise and domain knowledge on user interaction using the example of diabetes. For this purpose user effectiveness and efficiency have been measured on a simulated small screen device and related to user characteristics, showing that age and technology expertise have a big impact on usability of the device. Furthermore, impacts of user characteristics and success during the trial on acceptance of the device were surveyed and analyzed.",

abstract="Activity Recognition (AR) is a subset of pervasive computing that attempts to identify physical actions performed by a user. Previous sensor-based AR systems involve computation and energy overheads incurred by the use of heterogeneous and large number of sensors, however it is possible to arrive at an optimized system where the design involves optimization of energy consumption through number of sensors, computation through minimal set of features and cost through a nominal hardware platform ideally making it a multidimensional optimization. The above mentioned modelling was reflected in the construction of this optimized system as the design employs a single accelerometer and extracts only 7 time-domain features resulting in ease of computation to classify the activities, thus encouraging it to be inherently deployable on an embedded platform. The system was trained and tested on the accelerometer data acquired from three publicly available datasets. The performance of four chosen machine learning based classification models from an initial set of eight was evaluated, analysed and ranked on the grounds of efficiency and computation. The model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero (USD 5) and the average time for feature computation and the maximum time taken to classify an instance of an activity was found to be 0.015 s and 1.094 s respectively, thus validating the viability of the system on an embedded platform and making it affordable to the population in the low-income groups.",

abstract="Human Activity Recognition has been primarily investigated as a machine learning classification task forcing it to handle with two main limitations. First, it must assume that the testing data has an equal distribution with the training sample. However, the inherent structure of an activity recognition systems is fertile in distribution changes over time, for instance, a specific person can perform physical activities differently from others, and even sensors are prone to misfunction. Secondly, to model the pattern of activities carried out by each user, a significant amount of data is needed. This is impractical especially in the actual era of Big Data with effortless access to public repositories. In order to deal with these problems, this paper investigates the use of Transfer Learning, specifically Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, within human activity recognition systems. The yielded experiment results reveal a useful transfer of knowledge and more importantly the convenience of transfer learning within human activity recognition. Apart from the delineated experiments, our work also contributes to the field of transfer learning in general through an exhaustive survey on transfer learning for human activity recognition based on wearables.",

To demonstrate the system, we developed a wireless sensor network composed of Raspberry Pi boards with microphones as nodes. The audio classification system results to an accuracy of 83.79{\%} using a parallel network for the Urban8k dataset, extracting constant-Q transform (CQT) features as system inputs.

abstract="Three different instruction formats were examined respecting their usefulness for the navigation through hierarchical menus in mobile phones. 56 middle-aged adults had to solve four mobile phone tasks twice consecutively. Before completing the first trial, they were supported by instruction formats which contained different spatial knowledge types [28]. The first form was a procedural step-by-step instruction delivering landmark and route knowledge. The second instruction consisted of a visualized menu tree, in which the menu path to be taken was marked. By this, mainly survey knowledge but also route information was provided. The third instruction format also used the visualized menu tree. However, in addition to the menu path which had to be taken, also functions' labels were given, conveying landmark, route and survey knowledge. Further, a condition was examined in which no help was given. Dependent variables were navigation effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the step-by-step condition, the instruction type most often used in technical leaflets, had the smallest effect, especially for users with low spatial visualization abilities. With instruction forms which use diagrammatic visualizations and provide survey knowledge, navigation performance considerably improved.",

Given this information, our algorithm can track multiple people across the floor even in the presence of large sensor error. The algorithm we develop is evaluated for a variety of different movement patterns that include turning and path crossing. The error in correct path detection is shown to be very small even in the most complex movement scenario.

abstract="Patient satisfaction is an important metric for the evaluation of telemedicine applications to be able to provide patient-centred care. This paper analyses trends in patient satisfaction reporting of telemedicine applications, specifically comparing three telemedicine classes (store-and-forward, realtime consultation, telecare) and the two study stages of pilot and routine delivery. We also discuss the methods used to acquire satisfaction. This paper aims to challenge current approaches and provide recommendations on improving satisfaction evaluation of new telemedicine applications towards provision of patient-centred care. Literature searches were conducted for selected telemedicine studies which report measures of satisfaction from sources of Web of Knowledge and PubMed. Evaluations of patient satisfaction were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis reports that patient satisfaction evaluation is insufficient. However, an increased trend has been detected, which was most evident in the major growth area of telecare. Evaluations are not as actively performed in the routine delivery stage as the pilot stage. Our qualitative analysis found that measuring methods used are usually unsophisticated, poorly described, and often fails to allow patients to communicate their experience in a useful manner. Great attention must be paid to address overall deficiencies in the important area of patient satisfaction evaluation. Satisfaction evaluations are necessarily telemedicine class-specific with an emphasis on telecare applications. There is an obvious need to adopt standard methodologies for measuring satisfaction and ways of incorporating this into economic evaluation, to ensure comparability of data and applications, and not least to compel researchers to adopt an agreement on the dimensions of satisfaction to be evaluated.",

Recent studies have shown that the deployment of technological reminder based solutions, have to a certain extent, been capable of alleviating some of the issues associated with memory loss. Nevertheless, technical and usability challenges are still major hindering factors to large scale uptake. This work presents the details of the evaluation of a mobile phone based video reminding system with 4 persons suffering from mild dementia. We gathered 101 days worth of usability data during an evaluation period of 5 weeks along with a qualitative collection of pre and post evaluation questionnaires. The results from our evaluation have shown that out of 216 reminders delivered during the evaluation period only 18 of them were not acknowledged by the persons with dementia. Upon examining the post-evaluations, it was found that the carers played a significant role in terms of the success of the solution and that an initial settling in period of on average 14 days was required before users felt comfortable using the technology.",

But all these techniques have not an important rate in reducing the electrical energy consumption. So we note that an intelligent lighting which varies with the users need remains important source of economy of the energy. The intelligent lighting is obtained by using ambient intelligence (AmI). Multi agent System (MAS) have become the important paradigm to develop an ambient system because they have important characteristics like autonomy, proactivity and mobility to respond better to the main characteristic of ambient intelligence like the adaptability to the context.

abstract="Decreasing the energy consumption is an important goal for environmental sustainability. This paper describes MAID (Motion-based Ambient Interactive Display), an interactive public ambient display system, driven to motivate behavior changes regarding domestic energy consumption, through a persuasive game interface based on gesture recognition technology. The developed prototype guides players through the different rooms of a house, where they have to find out what is wrong and practice the correct actions to save energy, using similar gestures to the ones they would use in the real world to achieve the same goals. The system provides feedback regarding the consequences of each action. The paper also describes and presents the results of a user evaluation study performed during an open day event, attended by 6000 high school students, at our University Campus.",

abstract="This research aims to achieve the resident-centered community design by utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), and to create a trigger to regain rich relationship within a community by visualizing media spots which is defined as places where residents communicate much more than the other areas. In order to improve the media spot estimation method proposed by the previous research, we extracted and analyzed location information under various conditions. As a result, we could confirm that a portion of the highest density of location information corresponds to a resident's home place, and found that a home place can be accurately derived irrespective of the scattering in accuracy. Also, the analysis on how the distribution of location information varies depending on time zone suggests that it is necessary to use location information which is minutely divided in time or aggregated every day of the week.",

abstract="The topic of human robot interaction (HRI) is an important part of human computer interaction (HCI). Robots are more and more used in a social context, and in this paper we try to formulate a research agenda concerning ethical issues around social HRI in order to be prepared for future scenarios where robots may be a naturally integrated part of human society. We outline different paradigms to describe the role of social robots in communication processes with humans, and connect HRI with the topic of persuasive technology in health care, to critically reflect the potential benefits of using social robots as persuasive agents. The ability of a robotic system to conform to the demands (behaviors, understanding, roles, and tasks) that arise from the place the robot is designed to perform, affect the user and his/er sense of place attachment. Places are constantly changing, and so do interactions, thus robotic systems should continually adjust to change by modifying their behavior accordingly.",

In this work, an occlusion robust method is presented based on two features: human centroid height relative to the ground and body velocity. Indeed, the first feature is an efficient solution to detect falls as the vast majority of falls ends on the ground or near the ground. However, this method can fail if the end of the fall is completely occluded behind furniture. Fortunately, these cases can be managed by using the 3D person velocity computed just before the occlusion.",

abstract="With the emerging advancements in computer vision and pattern recognition, methods for human activity recognition have become increasingly accessible. In this paper, we present a robust approach for human activity recognition which uses the open source library OpenPose to extract anatomical key points from RGB images. We further use these key points to extract robust motion features considering their movements in consecutive frames'. Then, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory cells (LSTM) is used to recognize the activities associated with these features. To make the approach person-independent, different subjects from different camera angles are used. The proposed method shows promising performance, with the best result reaching an overall accuracy of 92.4{\%} on a publicly available activity data set, which outperforms the conventional approaches (i.e. support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests) which achieve maximum accuracy of 78.5{\%}. The proposed activity recognition system can contribute in prominent research fields such as image processing and computer vision with practical applications such as caregiving for older people to help them live more independently.",

In this system, we cope with not only the user's physical location but also all the situations of pervasive devices and requirements of associated users, in ``both'' sides of watching and watched sites. Moreover, social relationships between observers and a watched person are used to give an adequate privacy level to the services. To do this, we propose a pervasive watching over system ``uEyes''. In uEyes we introduce three distinguished features for the watching, they are (S1) Device awareness, (S2) User awareness and (S3) Social awareness. To realize these features, an autonomous decision making ability and cooperative behavior are employed to each element in the system. Based on these advanced features, a live video streaming system is autonomously constructed according to the device status and the user's situation, on both sides in runtime. As a result, the gentle watching-over service can be effectively provided.",

abstract="Automated activity recognition systems that use probabilistic models require labeled data sets in training phase for learning the model parameters. The parameters are different for every person and every environment. Therefore, for every person or environment, training is needed to be performed from scratch. Obtaining labeled data requires much effort therefore poses challenges on the large scale deployment of activity recognition systems. Active learning can be a solution to this problem. It is a machine learning technique that allows the algorithm to choose the most informative data points to be annotated. Because the algorithm selects the most informative data points, the amount of the labeled data needed for training the model is reduced. In this study, we propose using active learning methods for activity recognition. We use three different informativeness measures for selecting the most informative data points and evaluate their performances using three real world data sets recorded in a home setting. We show through experiments that the required number of data points is reduced by 80{\%} in House A, 73{\%} in House B, and 66{\%} in House C with active learning.",

In order to address the complexity, the used infrastructure must be interoperable and independent of underlying platform and must consider sensor observations in a uniform manner. This paper focuses on adapting a RESTful architecture for OGC's SWE services. This is done in order to overcome the limitations of SWE. The major limitations are associated with the architecture design and data format and this paper addresses these issues by implementing the different SWE services using RESTful architecture. The reason for this proposal is the fact that sensor nodes can be observed as RESFful resources and they are made attainable through SWE services and can be queried over SWE services. Another reasonable fact behind this proposal is that JSON data format which is lightweight can be used instead of XML in order to exchange messages; which can be a better extension for SWE. The performance analysis shows the advantage of using JSON notation instead of XML in terms of file size reduction.",

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a promising and fast growing area of technologies and services to assist people with special needs (e.g. elderly or disabled) in managing more independently their everyday life. AAL is founded on increasing needs for welfare technologies, as well as on significant effort from many scientific disciplines, the society, and the industry. The research has so far been primarily concentrated on elicitation of the functional aspects and on providing the technical solutions for the AAL systems and services. The problem of eliciting non-functional requirements and quality characteristics that are specific and critical for AAL, however, has been addressed to a much lesser extent. Failing to ensure the necessary system and service quality regarding critical characteristics may represent a significant obstacle to the wider acceptance of AAL in the society. There is hence a need to increase awareness of quality of AAL systems and services by providing the necessary supplement to the established state of the art. This paper reports on the process and the results from elicitation of AAL specific quality characteristics. The approach is based on established reference architectures and roadmapping material, as well as the ISO/IEC 9126 software product quality standard. The paper demonstrates how to do the elicitation in practice, and proposes the set of quality characteristics that are most important in the AAL context.",

abstract="Individual effort toward wellness is the most important factor to prevent and manage health risks. Though physiological sensing devices and self-care applications support that, sensing devices of most existing mobile healthcare systems are very expensive and the service only provides basic notification about a patient's condition. In this paper we propose a mobile self-care system using voice and facial images. The system consists of a health monitoring module and a symptom checking module. In the system emotion, age and gender information are acquired automatically by using distributed computing-based server-side multimodal emotion, age, and gender recognition system using voice and facial images. The user is then able to use their own voice and face effectively for wellness self-management.",

abstract="Aiming at the problem of a mobile robot searching human in home environments, a gird model is built and a path planning method based on a modified genetic algorithm and an improved A* algorithm is proposed. First, the grid map is divided into several unit regions using Boustrophedon cellular decomposition. Then, a unit region planning method based on a genetic algorithm is applied to generate a region transition sequence, and an effective strategy to search every region is adjusted according to the robot's sensors. Meanwhile, the optimal path between two points is generated by an improved A* algorithm, so that the path is much shorter and the number of turns is greatly reduced. Finally, the simulation results verify that this method can provide an optimized path in known home environments effectively, based on that the robot can find human in the shortest possible time.",

In this paper, we present an accompaniment system for calming the symptoms of patients with dementia with mental instability who repeat stereotypical behaviors and utterances.

The cadence begins on a chord that resonates with a patient's emotions and finishes on a chord that calms his symptoms. Because the use of this system is simple, even musical novices can use it to calm dementia patients' continuous stereotypical utterances.",

abstract="Modern portable devices (e.g. wearables) provide technical support to record physical activity, which can assist various purposes, ranging from geolocation, step count, body temperature and biomedical parameters among others. These technological advances, the increase of literacy in health and also in informatics placed the smartphone and its massive use in the center of a new paradigm of monitoring physical activity. When combining these functionalities with the ability to communicate with remote entities, then it is possible to expand the use of smartphones, not only to monitoring physical activity but also to promote widespread adherence to physical activity programs. This paper presents the conceptual framework of a global health community program centered on a mobile application and a dedicated backoffice web application to perform physical activity prescription and supervision based on dashboards. The MOVIDA platform is comprised of 4 main modules, targeting different groups of the population. This platform enables exercise prescription, monitoring of user's performance and adherence in metabolic diseases patients by MOVIDA.cronos, to specify and follow a cardiac rehabilitation program by MOVIDA.eros, to track and quantify indoor movements by MOVIDA.domus, and also access to a stratified training circuit, for maintaining or improve fitness level by MOVIDA.polis. In addition, this work reports the project main challenges from the conceptual phase of the technological platform to its development and implementation. This work can be useful for those who are starting a project with the same type of characteristics: multicentric, interdisciplinary and involving several partners in the community.",

abstract="This paper presents a human daily activity classification approach based on the sensory data collected from a single tri-axial accelerometer worn on waist belt. The classification algorithm was realized to distinguish 6 different activities including standing, jumping, sitting-down, walking, running and falling through three major steps: wavelet transformation, Principle Component Analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction and followed by implementing a radial basis function (RBF) kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Two trials were conducted to evaluate different aspects of the classification scheme. In the first trial, the classifier was trained and evaluated by using a dataset of 420 samples collected from seven subjects by using a k-fold cross-validation method. The parameters $\sigma$ and c of the RBF kernel were optimized through automatic searching in terms of yielding the highest recognition accuracy and robustness. In the second trial, the generation capability of the classifier was also validated by using the dataset collected from six new subjects. The average classification rates of 95{\%} and 93{\%} are obtained in trials 1 and 2, respectively. The results in trial 2 show the system is also good at classifying activity signals of new subjects. It can be concluded that the collective effects of the usage of single accelerometer sensing, the setting of the accelerometer placement and efficient classifier would make this wearable sensing system more realistic and more comfortable to be implemented for long-term human activity monitoring and classification in ambulatory environment, therefore, more acceptable by users.",

abstract="Assessing facial dynamics in patients with major neurocognitive disorders and specifically with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown to be highly challenging. Classically such assessment is performed by clinical staff, evaluating verbal and non-verbal language of AD-patients, since they have lost a substantial amount of their cognitive capacity, and hence communication ability. In addition, patients need to communicate important messages, such as discomfort or pain. Automated methods would support the current healthcare system by allowing for telemedicine, i.e., lesser costly and logistically inconvenient examination. In this work we compare methods for assessing facial dynamics such as talking, singing, neutral and smiling in AD-patients, captured during music mnemotherapy sessions. Specifically, we compare 3D ConvNets, Very Deep Neural Network based Two-Stream ConvNets, as well as Improved Dense Trajectories. We have adapted these methods from prominent action recognition methods and our promising results suggest that the methods generalize well to the context of facial dynamics. The Two-Stream ConvNets in combination with ResNet-152 obtains the best performance on our dataset, capturing well even minor facial dynamics and has thus sparked high interest in the medical community.",

abstract="New computer vision solutions dedicated for blind and partially sighted people have been recently introduced as a result of significant progress in computer science. Also the growing computation power of mobile and portable devices together with development of information systems allow to adopt and apply new and robust solutions that are able to work in nearly in a real-time and share and use information spread over IP network. Many of currently developed solutions are dedicated to support the user, giving the information about divert obstacles located in the environment. However many of them are using simple detectors (commonly ultrasonic echo-location) for obstacles tracking without its classification and recognition. Therefore the solution presented in this paper engages the stereo camera and image processing algorithms to facilitate its user with object detection and recognition mechanisms. The inference engine combined together with ontology based problem modeling allows to handle the risk, predict possible user's moves and provide the user with appropriate set of tips that will eliminate or reduce the discovered risk.",

abstract="This paper proposes a way in which cognitive models can be exploited in practical applications in the context of Ambient Intelligence. A computational model is introduced in which a cognitive model that addresses some aspects of human functioning is taken as a point of departure. From this cognitive model relationships between cognitive states and behavioural aspects affected by these states are determined. Moreover, representation relations for cognitive states are derived, relating them to external events such as stimuli that can be monitored. Furthermore, by automatic verification of the representation relations on monitoring information the occurrence of cognitive states affecting the human behaviour is determined. In this way the computational model is able to analyse causes of behaviour.",

abstract="Remote medical monitoring services for elderly people is necessary, especially for societies where the population of elderly people are rapidly increasing and healthcare costs are increasing due to lack of human resources. Wearable health-monitoring systems (WHMSs) can provide real-time medical condition monitoring using multiple biosensors attached to the human body. In this paper, virtual multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is proposed as a suitable technique for biosensor networks as it enables higher throughput capacity and less energy consumption than conventional schemes. The performance analysis of the proposed system shows that the lifetime of the virtual MIMO-based system outperforms existing systems.",

HL7, an ANSI-accredited developing organization, developed the most widely-used messaging standard in healthcare information systems.

In this paper, a description logic-based ontology in Web Ontology Language for HL7-RIM is proposed. This proposed ontology is used to instantiate medical records written in HL7, and also has been used to reason a sample medical rule.

And it is often acquired by sensitive mattress or chair without any constraints and limitations, but it contains many noise because of the impact of body and acquired equipment, those questions make heart rate detection difficult from the original BCG. In the paper, we propose an adaptive method which is used to extract heartbeat intervals (RR), and the method acquire automatically input parameters of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm, and then decompose BCG signal using EEMD algorithm, and select adaptively decomposition component of BCG signal, whose periodicity is in accordance with the cardiac cycle completely as the target signal. Furthermore we detect the peak points and calculate the heartbeat intervals series using the target signal. In the result, the proposed method is tested using the BCG datasets from 18 subjects, including 8 females and 10 males (age 20--72). Finally, the heart rate from BCG will be compared with ECG, and the results are satisfactory and have a high accuracy.",

In this article, we present a new study to adapt the grasping and the usage of an object designed by the user. Our method uses vision object recognition (CBIR) and an ontology for robotic manipulation. This recognition is implemented as a Web Service.

In this paper, force coefficient is investigated during the locomotion control using HMB. The force coefficient refers to the distribution ratio of permanent magnetic force and electromagnetic force in HMB.

abstract="Sensor-based human activity recognition aims to automatically identify human activities from a series of sensor observations, which is a crucial task for supporting wide range applications. Typically, given sufficient training examples for all activities (or activity classes), supervised learning techniques have been applied to build a classification model using sufficient training samples for differentiating various activities. However, it is often impractical to manually label large amounts of training data for each individual activities. As such, semi-supervised learning techniques sound promising alternatives as they have been designed to utilize a small training set L, enhanced by a large unlabeled set U. However, we observe that directly applying semi-supervised learning techniques may not produce accurate classification. In this paper, we have designed a novel dynamic temporalextension technique to extend L into a bigger training set, and then build a final semi-supervised learning model for more accurate classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed technique outperforms existing 7 state-of-the-art supervised learning and semi-supervised learning techniques.",

As a result, the model potentially becomes complex and costs much computing resources in mobile phone. This paper recognize people's physical activities when they place the mobile phone in the pockets near the pelvic region. Experiment results show that the accuracy could reach 97.7{\%}.

In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection scheme based on time series analysis that will allow the computer to determine whether a stream of real-time sensor data contains any abnormal heartbeats. If anomaly exists, that time series segment will be transmitted via the network to a physician so that he/she can further diagnose the problem and take appropriate actions. When tested against the heartbeat data readings stored at the MIT database, our ECG anomaly scheme is shown to have better performance than another scheme that has been recently proposed.

It describes the design, development and integration of the framework architecture as well as a Baxter robot based demonstration platform. Three key elements of the proposed framework (rehabilitation module, workspace and rehabilitation scenarios) have been described in detail. In the rehabilitation sessions, the users and the robot are asked to work together to place cubes so as to form a predefined shape. The robot and the user hold the same object in order to move it to a particular destination according to a rehabilitation scenario. If the robot detects a force from the user directed in the wrong direction during the navigation then it resists and corrects the movement in order to assist the user towards the right direction. The assistive support scenarios were designed to evaluate the achieved enhancement of precision, efficiency and dexterity of arm movements. The proposed rehabilitation framework provides a modular, automated and open-source platform for researchers and practitioners in neuromuscular rehabilitation applications.",

abstract="This paper deals with the problem of personal localization and guidance in indoor environments. The authors analyze different technologies which can be applied to this task. The goal is to provide users with the most accurate and reliable technology depending on users' profile. Indoor location technologies are analyzed and compared from different point of views. Relevant parameters which drive the overall system performance are highlighted. In particular, the indoor technologies studied are Bluetooth, WiFi, RFID, UWB and ultrasounds. With the aim to cover outdoor environments authors analyze technologies such as WiMAX and GPS. Finally, the indoor location system will be integrated with a GPS based outdoor localization system to provide global coverage. Based on this goal, integration issues are described and analyzed. All these investigations are within the framework of the project ELISA- Intelligent Location Environment for Assisted Services- www.elisapse.es.",

abstract="Falls are becoming a major public health problem, which is intensified by the aging of the population. Falls are one of the main causes of death among the elderly and in population groups that develop risk activities. In this sense, technologies can provide solutions to improve this situation. In this work we have analyzed different repositories of movements and falls designed to test decision algorithms in automatic fall detection systems. The objectives of the study are: firstly, to clarify what are the characteristics of the most significant accelerometry signals to identify a fall and secondly, to analyze the possibility of extrapolating the learning achieved with a certain database when tested with another one. As a novelty with respect to other works in the literature, the statistical significance of the results has been systematically evaluated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA).",

abstract="With the rapid development of wearable sensor technology, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on sensor data has attracted more and more attentions. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with perfect performance in speech recognition has a good effect on HAR. However, almost all these techniques train multiple Hidden Markov Models for different classes of activity. For a given activity sequence with multiple activities, the activity corresponding to the HMM with the maximum generating probability is selected as the recognition result, which is not suitable for continuous HAR with multiple activities. For this problem, we propose an improved Hidden Markov activity recognition algorithm where discriminative model and generative model are utilized. The discriminative model SVM is used to produce the observation sequence of HMM, and the generative model HMM is used to generate the final result. Compared with the traditional Hidden Markov HAR model, our proposal has good performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 score.",

abstract="Accurate localization of people in indoor and domestic environments is one of the key requirements for ambient assisted living (AAL) systems. This chapter describes how the received signal strength (RSS) measurements collected by a network of static radio transceivers can be used to localize people without requiring them to wear or carry any radio device. We describe a technique named radio tomographic imaging (RTI), which produces real-time images of the change in the radio propagation field of the monitored area caused by the presence of people. People's locations are inferred from the estimated RTI images. We show results from a long-term deployment in a typical single floor, one bedroom apartment. In order to deal with the dynamic nature of the domestic environment, we introduce methods to make the RTI system self-calibrating. Experimental results show that the average localization error of the system is 0.23 m. Moreover, the system is capable of adapting to the changes in the indoor environment, achieving high localization accuracy over an extended period of time.",

Geomanagement application acts as a valuable support to explore real estate and potential client information in each showing appointment, to share information among realtors and to help new and old realtors in developing teamwork skills while they are in movement. Clients also value the great contribution of Geomanagement regarding the collaboration between realtors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Geomanagement by generating value in, an uncommon scenario, as is a real state broker agency. We show that the implementation of Geomanagement increases both collaboration among realtors, and strategic control of managers and heads. Strengthening the link between collaboration and management control systems supported by Geomanagement, turned out to be crucial in business strategy follow-up and monitoring.",

abstract="Growing world population and rapid urbanization have increased the demand for mobility. The need for development of transportation technologies and infrastructural systems aimed at satisfying this increased demand is now non-negligible. As the number of private cars has increased after Industrial Revolution in spite of the unsufficient infrastructural capacity, the traffic problems are being confronted nowadays. As a solution to these problems, new roads are being built based on the ``predict and provide'' method which is part of today's traditional approach to transportation. However, it was found that new roads revive the stagnant demand, which even further complicate the traffic problem. In this context, it is believed that any solution focusing only on increasing the capacity and mobility in order to address the transportation problems will not be neither economical nor permanent. With this understanding in mind, traditional transportation approaches are replaced with sustainable transportation approaches with a trend initiated especially by the developed countries. The purpose of the sustainable transportation approach is to make investments into systems which place importance on accessibility; develop healthy, safe, equalitarian, comfortable and environmentally-friendly vehicle and infrastructure technologies; integrate transportation modes; which properly manage infrastructural capacity, passenger demands and operational supply; and relocate freight transportation to logistics centers. This study presents the historical development of sustainable transportation approaches and explores its principles in terms of environment, society and economy with award-winning exemplary projects, and offers recommendations for solutions to current problems of transportation in Turkey.",

Nowadays, it is at the core of the cultural debate centered on sustainable development, around which research is connecting the concepts of city livability, resource-efficient mobility, sustainable urban society. The problem of urban congestion amplifies the issue of suburban disintegration, with the needs, uses and purposes of the city and of its inhabitants being more and more neglected. With reference to a sustainable territory transformation, the challenge of the research is double: on one hand, it aims at elaborating hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the possible scenarios of urban alternative mobility---ought to become more efficient; on the other hand, it seeks to integrate mobility systems with the project of territorial interchanges, grouping the population together into poles, linked by environmentally-friendly collective transports. The scenarios offered within the open field of urban phenomenology intend to create ideal social and environmental conditions, to optimize the way urban spaces are used and to create a mobility system able to guarantee an accessible and safe urban environment.",

abstract="Neuropsychological tests are performance-based tasks to evaluate cognitive functions, but often they are particularly long and boring during their execution; these issues can interfere with performance provided by patients or healthy participants. In this paper, we present our gamified and virtually enhanced version of a specific neuropsychological test: The Baking Tray Task (BTT), aimed to assess unilateral spatial neglect (USN), a visuospatial processing disorder. This enhanced BTT version has been developed through STELT (Smart Technologies to Enhance Learning and Teaching) software, a platform which allows implementation of augmented reality systems based on RFID/NFC technology. These materials permit to link together smart technologies and physical materials, uniting the manipulative approach and digitalized technologies.",

abstract="Mental stress is a physiological state that directly correlates to the quality of life of individuals.Zanetti, Matteo Generally speaking, but especially true for disabled or elderly subjects, the assessment of such condition represents a very strong indicator correlated to the difficulties, and, in some case, to the frustration that derives from the execution of a task that results troublesome to be accomplished.Faes, Luca This article describes a novel procedure for the assessment of the mental stress level through the use of low invasive wireless wearable devices. The information contained in electrocardiogram, respiratory signal, blood volume pulse, and electroencephalogram was extracted to set up an estimator for the cognitive workload level.De Cecco, Mariolino A random forest classifier was implemented to assess the level of mental stress starting from a pool of 3481Fornaser, Alberto features computed from the aforementioned physiological quantities. The proposed system was applied in a scenario in which two different mental states were elicited in the subject under investigation: first, a baseline resting condition was induced by the presentation of a relaxing video;Valente, Martina then a stressful cognitive state was provoked by the administration of a mental arithmetic task.Guandalini, Giovanni The random forestGiovanni, Giandomenico classifier shows an accuracy of 97.5{\%} in discerning between these two mental states.",
