Nowadays, new media sources advertise large number of activities and for all age categories. These medias, however, are not adapted to the aging population. The paper presents a context-aware in-person social activity recommendation system for aging people named QueFaire. QueFaire interprets natural language descriptions of activities in social media and proposes suitable activities to aging people using fuzzy logic engine, taking in consideration user-profile and contextual information. Moreover, QueFaire provides support to help reach the location of a social activity.",

However, most of the current city and urban developments are based on vertical ICT solutions leading to an unsustainable sea of systems and market islands. In this work we discuss how the recent vision of the Future Internet (FI), and its particular components, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Services (IoS), can become building blocks to progress towards a unified urban-scale ICT platform transforming a Smart City into an open innovation platform. Moreover, we present some results of generic implementations based on the ITU-Ts Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) model. The referenced platform model fulfills basic principles of open, federated and trusted platforms (FOTs) at two different levels: the infrastructure level (IoT to support the complexity of heterogeneous sensors deployed in urban spaces), and at the service level (IoS as a suit of open and standardized enablers to facilitate the composition of interoperable smart city services). We also discuss the need of infrastructures at the European level for a realistic large-scale experimentally-driven research, and present main principles of the unique-in-the-world experimental test facility under development within the SmartSantander EU project.",

If you cant understand it, you cant control it. If you cant control it, you cant improve it (H. James Harrington). Therefore, if we want to understand what the smart cities initiative is all about we have to start measuring its brand new definition. After that well be able to monitor and control the performance of cities in terms of smartness, and this will lead to the possibility of improvement. In this research we present a set of indicators that specifically serve to measure the newly agreed and acknowledged international definition on smart cities. This set of indicators will be now tested to measure the smartness of the city of Girona, a small-medium sized city in Spain. At the completion of this pilot well be able to design an index summarizing the set (or subsets) of indicators, as a future steps of this research. A summarizing index will help to get an overview and to understand the overall performance of a city in terms of smartness. Then, targeted actions should be undertaken according to the results revealed by the specific indicators so that the overall smartness can be improved.",

Design of complex systems comprising of different IoT devices involves meeting of security requirements for the whole system. Creating a general security framework for such interconnected systems is a challenging task and currently we do not have standard mechanisms for securing such systems. The first step towards developing such a framework would be to build a classification mechanism which can identify the security capabilities or parameters of the different entities comprising an IoT system. In this paper we describe one such mechanism which can take user input to classify the different components of a complex system and thereby determine their capability to support security mechanisms of different degrees. This in turn would enable designers to decide what kind of security protocols they need to adopt to achieve end-to-end security for the whole system.",

Typically, interaction in the context of IoT means interfaces which allow people to either monitor or configure IoT devices. Some examples include mobile applications and embedded touchscreens for control of various functions (e.g., heating, lights, and energy efficiency) in environments such as homes and offices. In some cases, humans are an explicit part of the scenario, such as in those cases where people are monitored (e.g., children and elderly) by IoT devices. Interaction in such applications is still quite straightforward, mainly consisting of traditional graphical interfaces, which often leads to clumsy co-existence of human and IoT devices. Thus, there is a need to investigate what kinds of interaction techniques could provide IoT to be more human oriented, what is the role of automation and interaction, and how human originated data can be used in IoT.",

In the 1940s industrial control systems were making their presence felt in industry. In 1978 the X10 protocol was patented and allowed remote control of electrical appliances.

We did a set of interviews and a questionnaire-based survey with a sample of makers in various maker communities. We used this data to extract requirements for an application store, using the common app store metaphor as a starting point. The app store concept was developed as a proof of concept implementation, and evaluated through feasibility evaluation and focus group evaluation methods. Our findings show that although the app store metaphor is familiar and easy to grasp, there are some fundamental challenges when adapting the metaphor: (1) The difficulty of supporting the diversity in the software and hardware vendor market, (2) The tension between context awareness and the need for pre-configuration and pre-packaging, and (3) usability challenges related to the number of devices and apps.",

Smart home, which provides comfortable living environment to users with advanced technologies, is an important application field in IoT. With a large number of people who live remotely from family members, smart homes should provide not only convenient and comfortable services in a single house, but also mutual communication services to enhance interaction between family members. Unlike usual communication methods such as phone call, email, and chatting tools with human intentions, we propose a remote mutual situation-aware model between smart homes to let users contact with other family members in an unintended way. A prototype system has been implemented by detecting entrance and exit behaviors in smart homes. Through a feasibility confirmation evaluation of the system, the system worked well and could correctly reflect the entrance and exit behaviors in a remote smart home.",

Specifically, we give an overview of important related studies to illustrate how a variety of learning functions can be successfully incorporated into the smart home environment. We then present our approaches towards the issues of life-long learning and non-supervised learning, which are considered essential aspects of a smart home system. The two learning schemes are shown to be satisfactory in facilitating independent living over different time scales and with less human intervention.

According to the WHO (World Health Organization), in 2030 COPD will be the third leading cause of death, and the first cause of sanitary costs in Europe, due to the profiles of the expenses in health sector and the long time expenses by age groups and their important associate morbidity. New medical applications based on remote monitoring can help treat those chronic diseases but significantly will increase the volume of health information to manage, including data from medical and biological sensors, being then necessary to process this huge volume of data using techniques from Big Data.

We found that Smart City research was hosted in Architecture and Social Sciences journals in the first place, but since 2007--2008 the interest in this issue boomed among Engineering and Computer Science scholars. Whilst there is a growing number of publications describing many ICT-enabled solutions for enhancing the competitiveness, sustainability and livability of cities, only few studies have addressed the organizational issues implied in such innovations so far. On the other side, our graph describing the interdisciplinary links within the 118 analysed publications shows that management studies occupy a strategic position within the interdisciplinary network of Smart City research.

		"abstract": "SMART homes are soon going to be the reality with all the necessary technology available and changing lifestyle demanding it. Today, internet is being used for range of applications from banking needs to entertainment to day planners to appliance control. With internet capabilities and superior processing power of VLSI technology coupled with availability of wide range of sensors, it is no more a dream to have a SMART Home. This paper discussed the hardware and software technologies which can be used to realize the SMART Home. SMART Home hardware is defined as a Platform SoC identifying the specific differentiators which makes it a preferred candidate for such applications. Proposed PSoC is required to support many interfaces, standards to cater to wider functions of a Home to name a few Entertainments, healthcare, appliance control, environmental control, etc. User-friendly GUI, low power, and faster response will be the major differentiators of such platform SoCs. This paper attempts to identify the functional requirements of a basic Platform SOC and gives insight into PSoC architecture for SMART Home solution.",

		"abstract": "The smart cities initiative does not consist of filling our cities with tech gadgets, cameras and sensors for the purpose of monitoring and controlling both citizens and urban environment. The smart cities movement is not a marketplace for companies and businesses to sell their ICT products and services to governments. The smart cities objective is not to target the use of urban technology as an end in itself but as a tool towards more citizen-centric cities. Therefore, smart cities are not a big brother watching citizens but an inclusive and participatory arena for local governments and all interested stakeholders (including citizens) to co-create communities that can offer development opportunities to everyone and quality of live, no matter social group, age, or gender. This is the true objective of smart cities, which sometimes gets lost, forgotten or becomes shadowed by an excess of technology. But, how to achieve such a challenging objective? Fortunately, just recently, a definition on smart cities has been agreed by international standardization bodies which, so far, are the ones paving the way regarding concepts, terminology and general understanding of the smart cities movement. This novel definition builds on the sustainability concept, promotes urban development in good harmony with resilience, and uses technology only as a way for cities to measure their smartness and improve their performance. The author, aware of the big step forward that this internationally acknowledged definition is, takes the opportunity that this new piece of formally structured knowledge offers to elaborate a first-of-a-kind framework to conceptualize, model and simulate sustainability, and its practical implementation while promoting urban development and resilience to achieve higher performance levels of urban smartness.",

Elderly care is one of important applications in IoT, to grasp the situations around the elder people and then corresponding information can be sent to the care-givers to support the elder people. Abnormal activity detection is a particularly important task in the field, since the services should be immediately provided in such cases. Otherwise the elder people may be in danger. The existing approaches to this problem use some basic living patterns of the elder people, e.g. mobility per day, to detect abnormal activities. However, the detail abnormal activities in various specific situations cannot be detected, e.g., whether there is some abnormal activity when the elder people go to toilet, sleeps or eats something. To solve the above problem, in the paper, we propose a situation-aware abnormality detection system based on SVDD for the elder people. An experiment has been performed focusing on feasibility of the method and accuracy of the system to detect situations and abnormities from real sensors.",

Moreover, the potential of analytics methods for discovering activity recognition in such environment has been investigated. CASE easily allows to implement Smart Home applications exploiting a distributed multi-agent system and the cloud technology. The work is mainly focused on activity recognition albeit CASE architecture permits an easy integration of other kinds of smart home applications such as home automation and energy optimization. The CASE effectiveness is shown through the design of a case study consisting of a daily activity recognition of an elder person in its home environment.",

This paper intends to provide an economic solution to monitor the personal safety of the elderly in smart home according to the location movement status, and then check the safety with a set of light living pattern rules. It is assumed to be unsafe if the elderly remains at a space beyond the period defined in the rules. The family members, neighbor or doctor will be informed consequently if the elderly is recognized to be unsafe by the system. A prototype has been developed and the approaches were approved to be sufficient to check the scenarios. The pattern rules with trial duration were ignored and all the rules were customable and could be trained all the time.",

The scenario envisaged was the use of a medical stent implemented into the body, which monitors automatically the health status and which is able to remotely communicate with the doctor. Participants were asked to evaluate the pros and cons of the usage of this technology, their acceptance motives and potential utilization barriers. In order to understand the complex nature of acceptance, personal variables (age, technical expertise, health status), individuals cognitive concepts toward ageing as well as perceived usefulness were related. Outcomes show that trust, believe in the reliability of technology, privacy and security as well as intimacy facets are essential for acceptance and should be considered in order to proactively design a successful rollout of smart home technologies.",

In this paper, the PLC-utilized remote power metering and monitoring and control of power usages of respective power supplies have been implemented for the system. In addition, In-home headcount monitoring algorithm is proposed in an attempt to achieve efficient power usage management. It is expected that the proposed foundation technology will eventually become a foundation technology for the Internet of Things (IoT).

We argue here that current IoT infrastructure, testbeds and related software technologies should be used in such a context, capturing real-world human mobility and social networking interactions, for use in evaluating and fine-tuning realistic mobility models and designing human-centric applications. We discuss a system for producing traces for a new generation of human-centric applications, utilizing technologies such as Bluetooth and focusing on human interactions. We describe the architecture for this system and the respective implementation details presenting two distinct deployments; one in an office environment and another in an exhibition/conference event with 103 active participants combined, thus covering two popular scenarios for human centric applications.

However, very little research has been conducted on functions desired by prospective users, and how users will eventually use the fridge. A simulation of a smart fridge was developed and tested within a controlled laboratory between-subjects experiment with 105 participants. Four different assistance functions were tested. It was found that generally a smart fridge is evaluated as moderately useful, easy to use and people would tend to buy it, if it was already available. Emotional responses differed between the assistance functions. Displaying information on durability of products, as well as giving feedback on nutrition health and economics are the most appreciated applications. Structurally, overall usefulness ratings of the device are the strongest predictors for the intention to use a smart fridge, but the emotional response to the product was also an important explanatory variable. Results are not influenced by technical competence, gender, or sense of presence in the simulation. Regression models confirmed that the simulation-based results explained 20% more variance in product acceptance than written scenarios. An outlook is given on future questions to be answered using the simulation.",

For this purpose, and as part of Integrated Project Netcarity, far-field microphones and cameras have been installed inside an apartment and used to collect a corpus of ADLs, acted by multiple subjects. The resulting data streams are processed to generate perception-based acoustic features, as well as human location coordinates that are employed as visual features. The extracted features are then presented to Gaussian mixture models for their classification into a set of predefined ADLs. Our experimental results show that both acoustic and visual features are useful in ADL classification, but performance of the latter deteriorates when subject tracking becomes inaccurate. Furthermore, joint audio-visual classification by simple concatenative feature fusion significantly outperforms both unimodal classifiers.",

In this paper, it is presented the Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) of a healthcare AmI system to treat older people motor impairment problems by using specific devices to control the patients movements. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is being widely exploited. AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. One of the main differences of our system is that it provides therapist with support to design new therapies, to adapt them to each specific person and to control their execution instead of using a fixed set of exercises.",

This application domain, intersecting several areas of a smart city, from sustainable mobility to health and education, is at the same time very relevant from a societal perspective and very challenging from an ICT perspective, since it requires a combination of socio-psychological theories and practices and of advanced ICT techniques and tools. In this paper we illustrate the problem, analyzing on-going initiatives, lessons learnt and potential role of ICT solutions, and propose a solution, the CLIMB Platform, that will be experimented within the city of Trento.",

The purpose of this study is to show that problems with smart home technology can be partially ascribed to differences in perception of the stakeholders involved. The perceptual worlds of caregivers, care receivers, and designers vary due to differences in background and experiences. To decrease the perceptual differences between the stakeholders, we propose an analysis of the expected and experienced effects of smart home technology for each group. For designers the effects will involve effective goals, caregivers are mainly interested in effects on workload and quality of care, while care receivers are influenced by usability effects. Making each stakeholder aware of the experienced and expected effects of the other stakeholders may broaden their perspectives and may lead to more successful implementations of smart home technology, and technology in general.",

While this makes their data available on the Internet, it still remains a strictly devicecentric approach. However, one is usually interested in the phenomena observed by one or more devices and not in the sensors themselves. To bridge this gap, we introduce and evaluate the concept of Service-Level Semantic Entities (SLSE). They support the automatic semantic annotation of real-world objects based on networked sensor devices. SLSE continuously collect observations of sensors attached to some objects, and aggregates them to descriptions of the objects themselves. It then makes this augmented object data available as (semantic) linked data. This removes several layers of indirection in the semantic data, and allows to directly access properties of real-world objects.",

In this context, student works are analyzed under a theoretical framework. The second objective is to introduce the field of interior design as one of the forthcoming parties in smart technology implications. Interior design is a multi-faceted profession in which creative and technical solutions are applied to achieve a built interior environment. These solutions involve functionality, enhancement of the quality of life and the culture of the occupants and aesthetics. Interior design includes a scope of services to protect and enhance the health, life safety and welfare of the public. The paper analyzes and discusses nine design projects of the Topics Studio at the Interior Design Program, College of Architecture, University of Texas at San Antonio. In the 2012 Spring Semester, interior design students have applied an intense research pairing healthcare design strategies and smart technologies to two self-directed design thesis projects: A residence for Alzheimers Disease patient, and a healthcare clinic for medical professionals who treat patients including Alzheimers Disease. Projects are designed through the research and hypothetical application of remote control technologies, automation technologies, monitoring technologies, prompting / reminding technologies and prediction technologies. Physical and cognitive impairments, ADL limitations of older adults and patients, difficulties faced by family members and caregivers and clinical interventions in community health are considered not only from the interior design standpoint but also through technological advances. Results of this paper discuss how advanced technology is used as a design element by interior design students and merged with patient, caregiver and physician needs triad of healthcare projects. Perspectives on the studio experience are emphasized for future integrated design and practices of smart technology and interior design.",

This paper first conducts a survey of existing smart systems and techniques in detecting fall motion in human movement, including the emergence of new natural user interface (NUI) devices and systems in the consumer market. Secondly, the paper categorizes smart technologies for fall motion detection into three main technological groups: acoustic and ambient sensor-based, kinematic sensor-based, and lastly the computer vision and NUI. An insightful discussion of each categorys advantages and disadvantages is provided.

We then discuss our initial efforts to design and evaluate (using a Wizard-of-Oz methodology) a system which can make use of the existing programmable and wirelessly-networked, technology within the home, to provide a rich messaging service to older people as they conduct their everyday activities. Our research has the long-term aim of providing just-in-time, appropriate cues via multimodal displays to aid safer ageing-in-pace for the older population.",

These technologies are meant to support health and independence within the context of limited resources. Although there have been studies about the development of new devices and systems, there has been less research examining the impact of surveillance technologies that monitor those residing and working in care facilities. This paper reports the findings from a qualitative study of a residential care facility that instituted video surveillance. The findings revealed how surveillance was used as a care management tool -- to provide access to real-time data, to preserve the safety of older people and to monitor the working practices of formal carers. However, there may also be some unintended consequences of the implementation of video surveillance in residential care.",

There are a number of issues (e.g., underutilisation of local resources and dependence on cloud based data) that need to be addressed to exploit the benefits of utilising local data. We present a novel data dissemination model, called the Organic Data Dissemination (ODD) model to utilise the omni-present data around us, where devices deployed with the ODD model are able to operate even without the existence of networking infrastructure. The realisation of the ODD model requires innovations in many different area including the areas of opportunistic communications, naming of information, direct peer-to-peer communications and reinforcement learning. This paper focuses on highlighting the usage of the ODD model in real application scenarios and the details of the architectural components.",

This approach, however, suffers from applicability and scalability issues associated with sensor density and variations in performing user activities. In an effort to alleviate these challenges, the current study proposes a goal oriented top-down approach to assistive living which offers a paradigm shift from a sensor centric view to a goal oriented view. The basic concept of the approach is that if a users goal can be identified, then assistance can be provided proactively through pre-defined or dynamically constructed activity related instructions. The paper first introduces the system architecture for the proposed approach. It then describes an ontological goal model to serve as the basis for such an approach. The utility of the approach is illustrated in a use scenario focused on assisting a user with their activities of daily living.",

Urban barriers represent dangers for the blind users. The dynamism of smart cities promotes a constant change of these dangers and therefore a potentially dangerous territory for these users. Previous work demonstrated that redundant solutions in smart environments complemented by human computation could provide a reliable and trustful data source for a new generation of blind navigation systems. We propose and discuss a modular architecture, which interacts with environmental sensors to gather information and process the acquired data with advanced algorithms empowered by human computation.

However, as many of the elders choose solitary life alone and because of the isolation, the emergency service model has faced two main challenges: first, how to discover the fall accident; and next, how to communicate the emergency service center. In this research, we propose an intelligent homecare emergency service system based on two intelligent technologies: artificial neural network and intelligent software agent. The fall detector that based on tri-axes accelerometer and back-propagation neural network classifier is implemented to detect the fall events automatically. On the other hand, an intelligent agent-based homecare emergency service system is developed to communicate the emergency service center and hospitals for requesting help. In the meantime, the basic and important health information related to the elder will be sent together with that request. Thus, the emergency service center can base on the elders information to dispatch an available ambulance that takes the necessary medicines and equipment to the elders house.",

Also the Internet of Things (IoT) is a networking technology by using the smart objects and attracts high attention. Furthermore, a smart home which consists of these technologies is expected to be spread widely. In the smart home, it is important to get the information of location/position accurately in order to provide services based on the information of person or object. One of the most popular methods for estimating the position of person or object, the Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) method is used for many systems. RSSI method uses a behavior that strength of a signal from beacon node is inversely proportional to distance. However, the location of the wireless nodes which receive a signal has to fix and be discovered in advance. Therefore if the nodes are moved from an original position, the person or object cannot be detected accurately. Accordingly, we propose a method that estimating the positions of moved nodes and updating the position information by adding node for the RSSI positioning method. Currently, we have performed preliminary implementation of the system. In the future we will finish the implementation of the methods designed in the paper and evaluate the methods in details.",

A common symptom of old age is cognitive impairment, which can in some cases lead to the inability of self-navigation. Numerous indoor navigation systems have proposed to solve such problems. However, previous developers have only to a minor extent included elderly in the design process, despite the user groups complex needs. The solution presented in this paper is based on using recognizable aids and abstractions to ensure that the new proposed system is something elderly users can relate to and feel comfortable with. Other solutions often require wearable modules, or constant interaction, whereas this system does not require any of the two. In addition to our solution we present five implications when designing an indoor navigation system for elderly people.",

The aim of the new approach in healthcare is not only to monitor and improve health of individuals, but also to increase their independence, mobility, safety and social contact through increased communication, inclusion and participation using available technologies. A large number of new medical devices for health monitoring, home care, wellness promotion, gerontotechnology, etc. have to be designed, tested and adopted to meet the special needs and demands of different population groups. These new devices for telemonitoring and telediagnostics create large amount of health related information, in most cases from sensors organized into body sensor networks. The information has to be processed, transmitted from the point of care to the healthcare system in a safe way and after managing the information in an appropriate and intelligent manner, decisions related to the persons health are to be made.

This paper presents the findings from a ten week training course were participants were trained in the use of Facebook and EasiSocial, a newly introduced web application which displays Facebook in a manner which is more suitable for older people. An evaluation study was undertaken of both applications in an effort to gain insight into the reasons why older people (50--80 years old) do not use social media. Findings demonstrated that EasiSocial was statistically easier to learn and easier to use than Facebook and therefore potentially helpful to increase the adoption of Social Media technologies.",

In this paper a classification of uncertainties centered on a meal notion is first proposed. Two of these uncertainties are developed in a smart home and homecare context. Meal preparation probability is evaluated by a simulation based on Na\"ive Bayesian Networks. To determine if a person is at risk of malnutrition or undernutrition, and to supervise prepared meal quality and quantity in terms of nutrients, the use of RFID tags is discussed, bringing many open issues for which additional sensors are proposed.

To ground our design, we used design thinking as a guideline process. We evaluated the prototype using qualitative analysis of interview data. The findings show that the prototype motivated people grouping food and increased their awareness of the availability of food items in the fridge, the prototype also encouraged people in using food before expiration date. This paper offers three main contributions. Firstly, we identified three major problems that lead to domestic food waste. Secondly, we proposed a new design to address the problems. Thirdly, we applied design thinking as a design method to solve problems that related to domestic food waste.",

These ICTs are in the form of smart systems, which are physical objects that are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, enabling them not only to intercommunicate with one another, but also to exchange information with people and react to their environment. This paper is on a low-cost technology customised to the South African environment to support ambient assisted living. The technology takes advantage of South Africas digitalisation programme to provide broadband access in the support of AAL. Digital television as a gateway to internet access, wireless mesh networks for communication, motes for machine to machine communication and smart phones are the technologies supported in this architecture. A survey of AAL technologies was conducted and features of these systems that would be useful in defining our architecture identified. These features contribute to the development of an architecture for AAL. This research feeds into extending the body of knowledge on AAL technologies.",

Reflective assistance is concerned with the construction of flexible smart systems that control the eldercare environment, adapting the ambient to the needs of individuals. New technology transforms a living space to a helpful residence assistant that observes inhabitants and offers aid or calls for it in the case of need. To achieve this goal, systems must be capable of monitoring the behavior of the elderly people and of responding to dynamic changes in their performance or physical and psychological situation.

Smart homes provide the appropriate environment for keeping them independent and, therefore, enhancing their quality of life. One of the most important requirements of these systems is that they have to provide a pervasive environment without disrupting elderly peoples daily activities. The present paper introduces a CBR agent used within a commercial Smart Home system, designed for detecting domestic accidents that may lead to serious complications if the elderly resident is not attended quickly. The approach is based on cases composed of event sequences. Each event sequence represents the different locations visited by the resident during his/her daily activities. Using this approach, the system can decide whether the current sequence represent an unsafe scenario or not. It does so by comparing the current sequence with previously stored sequences. Several experiments have been conducted with different CBR agent configurations in order to test this approach. Results from these experiments show that the proposed approach is able to detect unsafe scenarios.",

Nevertheless, some challenges still remain: the lack of recommendations about which kind of information should be represented inside a dataset has resulted in the implementation of a variety of different non-standardized formalisms. On the other hand, this information is usually not sufficient to fully characterize the dataset. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a series of recommendations in the form of a dataset model with a well-defined semantic definition, for supporting those who are responsible for the creation, documentation and management of datasets. In addition, in order to better characterize datasets from a statistical point-of-view, we describe eight statistical analyses which should be included as additional measures within the dataset itself. We have validated our concepts through retrospectively analyzing a well-known dataset.",

The ontology will be our foundation for user modeling of patients in the telehealth domain, and hence it is one of the initial steps toward our vision. Compared to other ontologies within the domain, ours has explicit focus on: 1) personality traits of the patient, which is vital for fulfillment of our vision in term of adaptability, and 2) use of international standards to describe diseases, functioning and physiological measurement -- ICD, ICF and SNOMED respectively -- to promote interoperability with external systems. Besides being the foundation for user modeling, the ontology is a component in the Patient@home infrastructure, where it will ease the integration of applications to the platform, and facilitate semantic interoperability between the applications.",

This agent framework enables the customizability of agents in SHLAS.

These features of the framework provide Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) with ubiquitous access to sophisticated human computer interaction schemes for diverse uses. The proliferation of Smart TVs as central information hubs in elderly assisted living environments, along with the need for simple gesture control schemes for these demographics, provides one application of this framework.

First, in addition to established home security requirements, smart home adoption requires to solve brand-new security vulnerabilities deriving from the automated facets of smart homes. Thereafter, pervasive computing and ambient intelligence allow to collect a lot of information, to analyze it to derive new facts, and make them explicit. Finally, systems that are usually safe and dependable can fail when their behavior is becoming controlled as the result of complex interactions between many intertwined information systems. Unfortunately, application developers in smart home environments are usually neither security experts, nor familiar with ethical and legal requirements related to privacy. Security patterns can help to anticipate, overcome, and document systematically these difficult issues in building pervasive information systems in smart homes for cognitively impaired people. In this paper, we illustrate how security patterns can be extended and applied to Smart Home to foster autonomy of elderly or cognitively impaired people, then, we sketch the structure of the catalog which will be populated with a few patterns.",

We discuss four themes that emerged: an ambiguity in understanding the virtual boundaries created by wireless networks, the home network control paradox, a new home network access paradox, and the relationship between increased responsibilities and the possibilities of wireless networking.",

The approach permits both bottom up and top down methods of reasoning about data. The tradeoffs between granularity of ground truth acquisition and its impact on the detection rate are presented. It is suggested that the acquisition of ground truth should become a seamless operation incorporated transparently into the workflow of operations in these facilities. It is expected that with automation of collection, the increasing corpus of ground truth will lead to steady improvements in the detection rate and therefore the quality of automated monitoring and care provisioning. The methodology and models are substantiated with real data from two assisted living facilities, one in Singapore and the other in France. Although the results are preliminary they are quite promising.",

In this paper, we present a fully implemented architecture for domotic applications which uses the concept of a service as its fundamental abstraction. The architecture distinguishes between a pervasive layer where devices and their basic internetworking live, and a composition layer where services can be dynamically composed as a reaction to user desires or home events. Next to the architecture, we also illustrate a visualization and simulation environment to test home coordination scenarios. From the technical point of view, the implementation uses UPnP as the basic device connection protocol and techniques from Artificial Intelligence planning for composing services at runtime.",

This paper studies on the ontology base and the reasoning that are main parts of ADL pattern monitoring. The ontology base supports the semantic discovery for location, device, environments domains in smart homes. The reasoning system discovers the activity for a person and the appropriate service for a present situation. On detection of significant changes of context, the reasoning is triggered.

Furthermore, there is recognition of the fundamental importance of research with older users, and of understanding the interaction between individual and environment or technology in its broadest sense. This chapter reports on a component of a multi-disciplinary research project that was concerned with the introduction and use of a wide range of AT* in existing (older) housing occupied by older people. The main aims of the research were, in conjunction with ten housing partners, to investigate the feasibility and cost of introducing AT in relation, on the one hand, to user needs and, on the other, to the age, type and standard of property. However, the extent to which AT can narrow the gap between the home environment and individual capacity, depends upon the willingness of older people to use AT. If AT is to be introduced on any significant scale to support care in the community of older people, it must be easy and effective to use, and be positively welcomed by older people themselves. A key element in the research was therefore to explore with older people their use and experience of a range of AT.",

		"abstract": "The need to secure software application in todays hostile computer environment cannot be overlooked. The increase in attacks aimed at software directly in the last decade and the demand for more secure software applications has drawn the attention of the software industry into looking for better ways in which software can be developed more securely. To achieve this, it has been suggested that security needs to be integrated into every phase of software development lifecycle (SDLC). In line with this view, security tools are now used during SDLC to integrate security into software applications. Here, we propose a neural network based security tool for analyzing software design for security flaws. Our findings show that the trained neural network was able to match possible attack patterns to design scenarios presented to it. With the information on the attack pattern identified, developers can make informed decision in mitigating risks in their designs.",

The HCEE is placed within the economic flows of a bi-regional SAM for Italian economy which provides the data set for a CGE model where the hypothesis of involuntary unemployment is also considered. Two policy scenarios are then simulated to evaluate the impact of the policy reform in HCEE on total output and unemployment. Under the first scenario the Regional Government reduces the expenditure in integrated home care assistance (ADI) in order to directly increase the demand of private residential health care (ARA) services; under the second scenario the Regional Government transfers the resources saved by reducing ADI to the Households in order to stimulate their demand of ARA.",

This dynamicity requires a loose coupling between services and sensors/actuators.

Ideally, the current activity should be determined using the vector of all sensor readings; however, this results in an exponentially large space of observations. The current fix to this problem is to assume conditional independence between individual sensors, given an activity, and factorizing the emission distribution in a naive way. In several cases, this leads to accuracy loss. We present an intermediate solution, viz., determining a mapping between each activity and conjunctions over a relevant subset of dependent sensors. The approach discovers features that are conjunctions of sensors and maps them to activities. This does away the assumption of naive factorization while not ruling out the possibility of the vector of all the sensor readings being relevant to activities. We demonstrate through experimental evaluation that our approach prunes potentially irrelevant subsets of sensor readings and results in significant accuracy improvements.",

		"abstract": "An algorithm for decoding commands spoken in an intelligent environment through iterative vocabulary reduction is presented. Current research in the field of speech recognition focuses primarily on the optimization of algorithms for single pass decoding using large vocabularies. While this is ideal for processing conversational speech, alternative methods should be explored for different domains of speech, specifically commands issued verbally in an intelligent environment. Such commands have both an explicitly defined structure and a vocabulary limited to valid task descriptions. We propose that a multiple pass context-driven decoding scheme utilizing dictionary pruning yields improved accuracy; this occurs when one deals with command structure and a reduced vocabulary. Each iteration incorporates the hypothesis of the previous into its decoding scheme by removing unlikely words from the current language model. We have applied this decoding method to a comprehensive set of spoken commands through the use of Sphinx-4, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). When decoding via HMM, multiple previous states are used to determine the current state, thus utilizing context to aid in intelligent recognition. Our results show that within a fixed domain, multiple pass decoding yields recognition accuracy. Further research must be conducted to optimize practical context driven decoding and to apply the method to larger domains, primarily those of intelligent environments.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptive failure detection and recovery mechanism, namely, the Rotating Roll-Call-based Protocol (RRCP), for home environments. Failures of software components are detected efficiently with a roll-call-based algorithm in which the roll-caller is elected periodically. Adaptive techniques and reliable UDP are adopted to maintain home network stability. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is robust even under elevated failure rates.",

In order for prompts to be effective, they have to compensate the deficits of its users by exploiting their remaining strengths. To contribute solving the issue, we present, in this paper, basic guidelines that are useful for increasing prompt efficiency in smart homes.

Though most of the activity recognition systems use supervised learning techniques for building such models there is a shift towards the unsupervised learning paradigm as the process of annotating and labeling the data is prone to errors. This paper proposes an Event Pattern Activity Modeling Framework (EPAM) to identify the occupant activity pattern from the sensor data by using an unsupervised machine learning approach and further analysis is done with a knowledge driven approach. In the context of smart environments, an activity is considered as a sequence of events that are generated continuously from the sensor data. The segmentation algorithm proposed in EPAM is used to identify appropriate event patterns for an activity that are then grouped together using a pattern clustering algorithm that presents a hierarchy of activities. The set of activities of the occupant, observed in a smart environment is not always sequential but is highly interleaved and discontinuous. The proposed algorithm accommodates this valid factor by an innovative use of the Jaro Winkler similarity measure. The hierarchy of activity generated by the pattern clustering approach is used for activity modeling. Ontology based activity modeling is preferred over other modeling techniques because of its unified modeling, representation and semantically clear reasoning. The experimental results show that the proposed EPAM framework of segmentation, pattern clustering and ontological modeling is efficient and more effective than the existing approach of activity modeling.",

In $backslashmathcalR$transformation, 2D directional projection maps are computed through Radon transform, and then 1D feature profiles, that are translation and scaling invariant, are computed through $backslashmathcalR$transform. Then, we apply Principle Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis to extract prominent activity features. Finally, Hidden Markov Models are used to train and recognize daily home activities. Our results show the mean recognition rate of 96.55% over ten typical home activities whereas the same system utilizing binary silhouettes achieves only 85.75%.

One of the main conclusions from this analysis is that seeing the many different kinds of work that go into making homecare work is a good basis for designing alternative solutions.",

		"abstract": "An increasingly popular technique of monitoring activities within a smart environment involves the use of sensor technologies. With such an approach complex constructs of data are generated which subsequently require the use of activity recognition techniques to infer the underlying activity. The assignment of sensor data to one from a possible set of predefined activities can essentially be considered as a classification task. In this study, we propose the application of a cluster-based classifier ensemble method to the activity recognition problem, as an alternative to single classification models. Experimental evaluation has been conducted on publicly available sensor data collected over a period of 26 days from a single person apartment. Two types of sensor data representation have been considered, namely numeric and binary. The results show that the ensemble method performs with accuracies of 94.2% and 97.5% for numeric and binary data, respectively. These results outperformed a range of single classifiers.",

		"abstract": "Typically, when analysing patterns of activity in a smart home environment, the daily patterns of activity are either ignored completely or summarised into a high-level hour-of-day feature that is then combined with sensor activities. However, when summarising the temporal nature of an activity into a coarse feature such as this, not only is information lost after discretisation, but also the strength of the periodicity of the action is ignored. We propose to model the temporal nature of activities using circular statistics, and in particular by performing Bayesian inference with Wrapped Normal $$backslashmathcal (WN)$$and $$backslashmathcal WN$$Mixture $$backslashmathcal (WNM)$$models. We firstly demonstrate the accuracy of inference on toy data using both Gibbs sampling and Expectation Propagation (EP), and then show the results of the inference on publicly available smart-home data. Such models can be useful for analysis or prediction in their own right, or can be readily combined with larger models incorporating multiple modalities of sensor activity.",

This paper proposes kernel fusion method, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to improve the accuracy of performed activities. Although, SVM is a powerful statistical technique, but still suffer from the expected level of accuracy due to complex feature space. Designing a new kernel function is difficult task, while common available kernel functions are not adequate for the activity recognition domain to achieve high accuracy. We introduce a method, to train the different SVMs independently over the standard kernel functions and fuse the individual results on the decision level to increase the confidence of each activity class. The proposed approach has been evaluated on ten different kinds of activities from CASAS smart home (Tulum 2009) real world dataset. We compare our SVM kernel fusion approach with the standard kernel functions and get overall accuracy of 91.41 %.",

In this context, telemedical services for communication between doctors and patients come into fore. However, it is unclear in how far users accept these new care concepts. Crucial for the success of telemedical services is the choice of the medium and its perceived appropriateness in different using situations. In this paper, an exploratory approach was undertaken to examine the users acceptance of four electronic communication media (telephone, videophone, videoconference, interactive wall) in three different usage situations (additional service, urgency situation, exclusively telemedical consultation). 200 participants volunteered to take part. Findings show that the acceptance strongly depends on the specific situation and the type of communication media. User diversity, in contrast, did not show a major role for the acceptance of telemedical consultation.",

These tendencies make more concrete the issue regarding elderly people: the more they grow old, the more they are likely to need medical, social and personal care services. Nursing home care services are probably the most important example in terms of social costs, not only because they are extremely expensive from an economic point of view, but also because they determine a forced relocation of elderly people. To be compelled to live in a new place, completely depending on other peoples assistance, has unquestionably a deep psychological impact (Hormuth, 1990): probably more difficult to assess than the economic expenditures, but definitely not less significant. Elderly people undoubtedly prefer living independently in a familiar domestic and residential setting. Anyway, a new series of problems arises, due to the shortage of residential infrastructures and facilities and the lack of home service workers compared to the large number of people who need assistance. As for domestic settings, in addition, the psychological impact of a long term home care assistance is still far from well understood: assistance provided by other people can generate a stronger negative influence upon final users, in that they may perceive a loss of control in their living space, and they may look at home service caregivers as privacy intruders. This condition may represent a menace to self-esteem and to the integrity of personal identity.",

Starting from a conventional TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) based technique using uniaxial acceleration sensors we show how to minimize installation cost by reducing the number of sensor entities via tri-axial sensor technology. We describe the main challenges of wave propagation in solids, namely dispersion and multipath propagation and discuss their implications on robustness and accuracy of localization results.

		"abstract": "Activity modelling plays a critical role in activity recognition and assistance in smart home based assisted living. Ontology-based activity modelling is able to leverage domain knowledge and heuristics to create Activities of Daily Living (ADL) models with rich semantics. However, they suffer from incompleteness, inflexibility, and lack of adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning and evolving activity models. The approach uses predefined seed ADL ontologies to identify activities from sensor activation streams. We develop algorithms that analyze logs of activity data to discover new activities as well as the conditions for evolving the seed ADL ontologies. We illustrate our approach through a scenario that shows how ADL models can be evolved to accommodate new ADL activities and preferences of individual smart homes inhabitants.",

A super aged society occurs when, one third of the population is 65+ years and one fifth is 85+ years.

The goal is to reposition the Portable Health Clinic as a health information and affordable disability prevention system. In this paper, we show how the healthcare worker can supplement her competence on medical risk factors with sensor technology and share her knowledge with elderly patients within the community. We suggest that the remote telemedicine call center should be used to support distant screening and surveillance programs and provide early intervention to diseases. We investigate 18,278 Portable Health Clinic Electronic Health Records between 2012 and 2013 to see what are the most important risk factors for ill health in Bangladesh.

Our experiments on the MATCH corpus show clearly that we need age-specific adaptation in order to recognize older users speech reliably. Language models need to cover typical interaction patterns of older people, and acoustic models need to accommodate older voices. Further research is needed into intelligent adaptation techniques that will allow existing large, robust systems to be adapted with relatively small amounts of in-domain, age appropriate data. In addition, older users need to be supported with adequate strategies for handling speech recognition errors.",

		"abstract": "In the 21st century, there has been an increase in the ageing population and people with disabilities in the majority of the world. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates suggest that the world total will be more than one billion people aged 60 or over by the year 2025 (Marshall et al., 2004). Thus, ageing population has been a growing concern in Turkey as in other countries. Especially in Turkey, where most Turks live in high-rise apartments, it is important to design housing universally. Turkish culture is based on a close relationship between the older people and their families. Today, rather than preferring specialised institutions, most of the older people want to live in their own houses, where they lived when they were younger. There is a crucial need for alternative daily living environments based on universal design that provides a higher level of accessibility, usability and adaptability for all users regardless of their size, age or ability. This study aims for a cultural understanding of the views of the Turkish older people on designing their homes for ageing in place. It is based on data from empirical research on universal design. The cultural differences between Turkey and places like the US, the UK and Europe, where most of the research in this area has been done, could provide fascinating insights.",

The series of workshops on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS 2004-2006) emerged from this awareness. One of the primary outcomes of this endeavor was a principled understanding that the agent environment should be considered as a primary design abstraction, equally important as the agents. A special issue in JAAMAS 2007 contributed a set of influential papers that define the role of agent environments, describe their engineering, and outline challenges in the field that have been the drivers for numerous follow up research efforts. The goal of this paper is to wrap up what has been achieved in the past 10 years and identify challenges for future research on agent environments. Instead of taking a broad perspective, we focus on three particularly relevant topics of modern software intensive systems: large scale, openness, and humans in the loop. For each topic, we reflect on the challenges outlined 10 years ago, present an example application that highlights the current trends, and from that outline challenges for the future. We conclude with a roadmap on how the different challenges could be tackled.",

		"abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the elderly, can be distressing to both the elderly and their carers, and often contribute to institutionalisation when the disruptive night behaviour of the older person exerts its toll on the carer. The main way of determining Sleep Activity Pattern (SAP) and aberrant changes in the normal sleep/wake cycle is through verbal reports of the patient and his/her carer, information that can be subjective, incomplete and unreliable. An emerging modality for SAP monitoring is actigraphy, involving the use of wearable sensors commonly based on accelerometers. To bring actigraphy to the next level in order to reap its benefit for the elderly population at large, one must consider its deployment in realistic settings such as nursing homes and in the homes of the subjects. In this paper we provide a brief account of the trial deployment of our SAP monitoring system in a nursing home, where data was collected from fifteen elderly residents for a period of two weeks each. Besides providing an objective basis for obtaining sleep related information from patients who are often unable to remember clearly how well they have slept, our system benefits staff and doctors by providing more accurate information as a supplement to the sleep diary, and hopefully even eliminate the need for the latter.

Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. Advances in ubiquitous computing and wireless sensor networking have opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems. In-home pervasive networks may assist residents by providing memory enhancement, remote control of home appliances, medical data lookup and emergency communication. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents Home Healthcare Network (H2N), a complete system integrating the abundance of existing sensor nodes and other devices with pervasive, wireless networks. Our approach focuses on improving social aspects of elderly care besides the conventional care-giving functionalities. Finally, we talk about the importance of preserving privacy of such a system and propose a primitive solution for the inclusion of privacy awareness in the system. Although H2N is basically designed to function as a healthcare aide for the elderly people, with little customization it can be used to accommodate other user groups as well.",

However, even smart home services that are technologically feasible and acceptable are not taken off as end-users cannot find them in todays fragmented marketplace with an overload of information. Basically there is a demand and supply mismatch. We argue that a matchmaking or brokering platform is required that helps end-users to search for smart living services and on the other hand support (service) providers promoting their products. In this paper, we propose a conceptual design for such a platform based on two series of exploratory interviews with stakeholders in the domain.",

The microphones are installed along the path from bedroom to lavatory. An activity sound database containing 105 designed scenarios is simulated and transcript in terms of 21 acoustic events such as footfall, fall down, and calling for help to form the acoustic event database. 21 Hidden Markov models (HMM) corresponding to acoustic events are trained by the acoustic event database. A keyword spotting recognition technology is adopted to recognize acoustic events and its ordered sequences for modeling activities. Acoustic features are computed by 39-dimensional mel-scaled frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with their first and second derivatives. The preliminary results show the average recognition rate of acoustic events is 91% for inside testing and 72% for outside testing respectively. The proposed approach shows an encouraging potential on the demand of modeling the regular living patterns of every variety.",

		"abstract": "Advances in networking and small sensors (motes, RFID tags, etc) have made it possible to monitor and provide medical assistance to people in need at their homes. Recently, WISP tags, one advanced technology of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, have been used to monitor indoor activity, vital signs, sleep quality, and health status remotely. These types of systems take collaborative decision based on the data collected from all the WISP tags of the system. Any missing tag data within the environment may introduce critical error in the systems decision and this eventually may jeopardize systems decision reliability. In order to maintain systems reliability, a monitoring protocol needs to be executed frequently and it should be made efficient in terms of execution time. This paper studies the problem of monitoring a large set of WISP tags and identifying the missing ones. In this paper, based on probabilistic methods, we propose a monitoring protocol for WISP based Smart Healthcare Monitoring Systems. The goal of this protocol is to improve the security and reliability of a smart healthcare monitoring system by detecting missing tags and reporting back only the data of the existing tags.",

The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of potential incentives for using AAL technologies. The data was coded using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). In total 13 incentives could be identified, which were grouped into six categories: (1) social incentives, (2) health and safety incentives, (3) activity incentives, (4) novel sensory incentives, (5) status incentives and (6) self-reactive incentives. Within these categories social connectedness and health and safety were the most important incentives.

The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.",

Cognitive decline is one of the most taxing health problems in terms of both its relation to elders overall functioning and the cost of care. The needs of elders with cognitive decline -- for invisible, intuitive support and assessment -- invite a reconsideration of the assumptions behind and specifications for ubiquitous computing solutions. This paper describes findings and implications of ethnographic research conducted with cognitively impaired individuals and their informal care networks in 45 households in 5 U.S. regions. Key themes regarding needs and barriers to successful aging are addressed through a set of design principles which apply across the stages of cognitive decline. To convey stage-specific findings and associated challenges for ubiquitous computing, case studies of four representative households and example concept solutions are presented. The design principles and technology challenges outlined in this paper may generalize to other contexts for ubiquitous computing.",

For the first time, the CSI phase difference over two antennas is identified as the salient feature to reliably segment the fall and fall-like activities, both phase and amplitude information of CSI is then exploited to accurately separate the fall from other fall-like activities. Experimental results in two indoor scenarios demonstrate that Anti-Fall consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall, with 10% higher detection rate and 10% less false alarm rate on average.",

One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost off-the-shelf technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial observations from the field taken during the USEFIL AAL platforms integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

While smart homes used to equal home automation, evolving ICT technologies now enable truly adaptive and intelligent services that are integrated in several industries. Sector-specific service platforms are emerging that provide basic intelligence for services. However, smart living services should not be constrained to a specific industry sector, and hence the service platforms should be easily accessible for service providers regardless of their industry. In addition, smart living services should not be constrained to residents within the home, but should take advantage of outdoors position information to open up a range of novel service concepts. Establishing such a vision of smart living involves various technological and organizational challenges. This paper gives an overview of the current service platforms for smart homes and positioning information. Based on this overview, we propose a research agenda for enabling smart living services. The two major issues are how to achieve collective action between players from multiple sectors in order to set up a common service platform, and how to design business models that allow adding GNSS-based positioning information to the service platform.",

This study explores the acceptance of home-integrated ICT (hands-free equipment, camera, positioning system). In different domestic spaces (living room, bedroom, bathroom) acceptance for integrated technology was assessed, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods. Results show that users acceptance differs considerably depending on the room type (acceptance is the highest in the living and the lowest in the bathroom). Moreover, the most disliked technology for home monitoring are camera-based systems, followed by the positioning system and the microphone. Also, there was a significant interacting effect of room type and technology: While none of these technologies is accepted for the bathroom, the living room is less sensitive to their presence with the microphone as the most accepted technology. User diversity does not play a major role hinting at generic acceptance patterns regarding ICT integrated in home environments.",

Moreover, this smart household control system is automatic, unsupervised and entirely adaptive to the users needs and wishes. It provides optimum home conditions to ensure the inhabitant wellness in accordance with the monitoring of his/her physiological and behavioral variables.",

The pathologic persistence (called also perseveration) in tasks of daily life is a marker of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease, and its non-invasive detection can lead to early diagnosis, if it triggers a battery of diagnostic tests based on imaging, clinical neurology and cognitive tests to confirm the suspicion of neuronal degeneration. Finally, the tele-monitoring of daily activity, called actimetric monitoring, allows the detection of abnormal repetitive tasks, and contributes also to the content of a custom folder of health data, which can provide a therapeutic education adapted to the person followed at home.",

The effect of using such technology promotes a level of independence in addition to improving social awareness and interactions [1]. As trends in life expectancy increase, the number of age related impairments and chronic disease within the elderly population will also rise. While for some of these conditions there is no cure, with the help of assistive technology, diseases such as Alzheimers for example may be effectively managed. Assistive technology within this domain can be used to support activities such as medication reminders, picture dialing phones and clocks to support day/night orientation. This paper presents an overview of the challenges associated with those suffering from chronic disease, in particular Alzheimers disease and defines the methodology of how current advances in mobile phone technology and their associated services may be used to alleviate some of the issues experienced by chronic disease patients.",

The impact of ageing on the heath system is therefore unprecedented. Primary and preventive care is important to ensure older adults to receive immediate healthcare so that their health problems can be handled and alleviated in a timely manner, thus reducing the risk of development into serious illnesses. However, degradation of mobility in elderly becomes a hurdle to the access of healthcare services. In the paper, we present an outreach community healthcare model via a mobile clinic, which provides health assessment, interventions and health education to community-dwelling elderly. A key highlight of the mobile healthcare model is the adoption of healthcare information system (HIS) to streamline the operations and to enable smooth service delivery even with tight human resource. The role of information technology, the resulting benefits and outcomes are discussed in the paper. The HIS-leveraged mobile healthcare model is highly praised by the community and serves as an exemplar for establishing mobile clinics for various healthcare services.",

In this paper, we propose to evaluate the performance of upper extremity reaching tasks with in a kinematic perspective by assessing the smoothness of motion trajectories with the entropy of shape model, including curvature and torsion. The simulation result confirms that approximate entropy of shape model is consistent with the change of the smoothness in motion trajectory while it is capable of classifying six levels of the ability to perform upper extremity reaching tasks with higher accuracy.",

This paper introduces the work in progress in constructing a stable and efficient Broadband Multiple Modes Residential Gateway (BMMRG) which supports multiple access interfaces, multiple services, IPv6, security, QoS and remotely web management. It is mainly based on an IXP425 network processor and a Linux kernel. We first present the hardware and software architectures of BMMRG, and then we introduce their in-detailed implementations. In the meantime, an intelligent home system is proposed based on BMMRG and household appliances equipped with wireless and ZigBee adapters. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of BMMRG is verified through testing.",

One of the key issues relating to this challenge is in providing solutions which can be managed by non-technically orientated healthcare professionals. Within the current work efforts have been made to develop and evaluate new tools with the ability to specify, in a non-technical manner, how the technology within the home environment should be monitored and under which conditions an alarm should be raised.

The acceptance of the systems, however, depends on how users experience them in real contexts. While many of the ubicomp research projects include some form of user study, there is no overview of how user experience (UX) is approached in ubicomp research. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of ubicomp UX studies. Our findings reveal that usersexperiences with ubicomp systems have often been investigated in rather lightweight ways, for example by addressing basic usability issues, collecting ratings by simple, predetermined scales, or producing descriptions of general experiences such as fun and trust. Based on the findings we argue that a deeper and more fine-grained understanding of user experience would help developing more successful ubicomp systems. We propose a ubicomp UX framework that can help design and evaluate ubicomp systems with a desirable set of target experiences.",

Successful prediction helps automate device control operations and tasks within the environment as well as to identify anomalies. Thus, the learning and prediction based paradigm optimizes such goal functions of smart environments as minimizing maintenance cost, manual interactions and energy utilization. After identifying important features of smart environments, we present an overview of our MavHome architecture and apply the proposed paradigm to the inhabitants location and activity tracking and prediction, and automated decision-making capability.",

Each home was fitted with six sensing elements to establish and monitor daily and nocturnal activities. Sociality behaviours were explored through social contact through phone conversation and human interaction, through mobility, inside and outside the home, and through a persons self reported internal state (how they feel each day). Nocturnal rhythms were examined through actigraph watches and bed pressure sensing devices.

		"abstract": "Much of the work in the smart house technology has been done on individual technologies, but little has been done on their integration into a cohesive whole. The Bluetooth house project at Massey University in New Zealand, which was initiated in 2002, embraced a systems engineering approach to design a usable smart house, aiming at a complete and integrated solution, which can be customised, based on individual needs, to give elderly people independence, quality of life, and the safety they require. This paper presents how the Massey Bluetooth smart house design project has been carried out and what the smart home may look like in the near future. Considering current technical feasibility and the advances in other research, it is suggested that for a house to be considered as truly smart, four levels of smartness are imperative: smart sensors, smart management, smart control, and smart appliances. The Bluetooth house at Massey University incorporates these four smart technologies and allows all these individual technologies to be integrated into a seamless whole. For smart sensing, the project employed Bluetooth technology to connect the whole house, and to locate the users position. In order to coordinate all the technologies, a smart management system was developed, that is capable of coordinating the information for commands, feedback from smart appliances, and users location information. It can make intelligent decisions on what to do, or relay necessary information to individual intelligent devices throughout the house. In addition, the medium of communication with the house must be as natural as possible, in order to make it as easy as possible for the occupants of the smart house to interact with and the various smart appliances. A voice-activated universal remote control and a new microphone system are being developed to this end. Finally, the smart house has to provide an enjoyable experience that can promote the uptake of smart house technology by users in the future. An interactive TV environment is being developed to this end. The Massey Bluetooth house project is not so much aimed at a cutting-edge technology in smart house design, but at integrating technologies into a seamless, cohesive whole through the application of four levels of smartness.",

		"abstract": "Recently the importance of autonomous monitoring has become an essential part of the society. Autonomous monitoring and control in a home environment can lead to energy savings. Also autonomous monitoring can serve as an alerting mechanism when something is out of the norm so that the controlling mechanism can rectify the problem. In this paper we present a system we developed using multiple sensors for autonomous monitoring and control with relatively low cost components. The sensors we integrated together in to one central operation unit can monitor room temperature, humidity, human motion activity etc. We present a prototype implementation of an energy efficient home environment using our proposed centralized monitoring platform. Using a sample scenario we show that the energy consumption in a smart home is about 15kWh while that of a normal home is about 35kWh.",

Indeed, in this research work, we propose a platform that addresses the problem of energy management of different electric devices in a smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT) building and particularly high performance computing (HPC) data centers. This platform integrates the mobile technology as a means to facilitate the maintenance operations usually executed by the mobile workforce agents on smart building electric devices. Another important issue integrated in this proposed platform deals with the monitoring of a life safety plan in case of an emergency scenario due, for instance, to fire detection. The emergency rescue monitoring is eased by the use of mobile devices such as the tablets, usually handled by people in a smart ICT building.",

Three aspects of programming - behavior generation, modification and (de) activation are addressed using two tangible user interfaces - i) NFC cards for smart behavior creation and modification and ii) a digital memo board as a placeholder for (de) activation of intelligent behavior.

In this domain different requirements regarding context modeling can be identified that are not in the focus of current context models.

An inhabitant of a smart home needs to get and give feedback on context in a way that can be understood and handled without context modeling expertise. At the same time such simplified context description must be matched on the technical details of context sensing and context dependent service adaptivity. In this paper we introduce a layered context model for AAL which provides different abstraction levels. Therein we focus on model elements and concepts on the user interface layer.",

Computers, televisions, tablets, gaming devices and sound systems are just some of the many appliances that need that connection. Despite the improvements to the hardware of networking devices, re-search shows that the software to set up networking devices along with their configuration are extremely complicated. This paper presents the results of several usability investigations on home networking devices including: a comparative study of different product brands, two series of user surveys, and empirical observations. The results of these investigations show that all of the major brands of home networking appliances use a complex, feature-oriented, rudimentary user interface (UI) design with terms that are understood by a very small percentage of people.",

It provides a short overview of the overall system and offers details on the different interaction types supported by the system. Interacting with the user occurs either as part of a scheduled procedure or as a consequence of identifying or predicting a potentially hazardous deterioration of the patients health state. The overall logic of the interaction is structured around event-scenario associations, where a scenario consists of concrete actions to be performed, some of which may involve the patient. A key objective in this type of interaction that it is very simple, intuitive and short, involving common everyday objects and familiar media such as speech.",

The increasingly specialised devices and rapidly advanced assistive technologies require a composite architecture of scalable non-textual reading services. We illustrate this requirement by three user scenarios at a scale of a device, an object-awareness and a real-time situated meaningful response.",

The adoption of MDA is still low, partly because of the general-purpose modelling language being used. Domain specific modelling languages are being developed for technological and industrial domains to improve the expressiveness and effect of model-driven development techniques. The healthcare domain could benefit from these methodologies. In order to incorporate domain knowledge in a MDA process, information about workflows, artefacts and actors can be formalized in a UML profile and applied by MDA tools for design and development. This paper presents the work done on model-driven development of smart homecare services in the MPOWER project. Following an iterative approach, two UML profiles to support development of Service Oriented Architecture based homecare applications are proposed. Using homecare specific UML profiles indicate an improvement in the process for model-driven development of homecare services.",

Medical systems and CDSS standards compatibility requires mediation process to ensure seamless information exchange. We propose such mediation system between medical systems and CDSS called AdapteR Interoperability ENgine (ARIEN) to achieve data level interoperability. We consider information flow from smart homes and medical systems in HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format with CDSS compliant to Virtual Medical Record (vMR) standard. The responsibility of the proposed system is transformation of smart homes and medical systems compliant standard format information into CDSS compliant standard format for processing of information and vice versa.

It is given by the development of demographic and age structure of the population and the need to ensure support and safety of elderly and handicapped people with increased health and other risks. Currently there is a lack of graduates having interdisciplinary theoretical education in the fields of electronics and information and communication technologies and simultaneously focusing on the whole complex of practical needs of applications related to assistive technologies. The same situation arises at producers of these technologies. There are very few graduates able to understand and realize complex applications as a whole. Most of the graduates are able to manage separate narrow applications without ability to interconnect them. Therefore we have decided to develop a series of courses that will fill the gap in the education. The courses will become a core of an interdisciplinary study branch in Master study and at the same time they will be offered in life long learning. The core courses cover the following topics: data sensing and transmission; sensors, actuators and control in assistive environment; circuitry and system principles of electronic devices for AT; advanced methods of data mining and knowledge discovery and their applications in AT; telecommunication equipment and systems for AT; multimedia technology; security and safety; system integration; legal, ethical and social aspects of AT.

Activity recognition can be used to help elders live longer in their own homes independently, by providing assurance of safety, instructing performance of activity and assessing cognitive status. In this work, we propose to discover both intra- and inter-activity association patterns from daily routines of elderly people. Specifically, a data mining method is proposed to extract the most frequent sequential sequences of steps inside each individual activity (i.e., intra-activity pattern) and activities (i.e., inter-activity pattern) of a set of daily activities. These patterns can then be used to model human daily activities for activity recognition purpose, or to directly instruct/prompt elders with impaired memory when they perform daily routines. The experimental results conducted on two individuals datasets of daily activities show that our proposed approach is workable to discover these association patterns.",

		"abstract": "Pervasive computing has emerged as a viable solution capable of providing technology-driven assistive living for elderly. The pervasive healthcare system, CARA(Context Aware Real-time Assistant), is designed to provide personalized healthcare services for elderly in a timely and appropriate manner by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. The work in this paper introduces a personalized, flexible and extensible hybrid reasoning framework for CARA system in a smart home environment which provides context-aware sensor data fusion as well as anomaly detection mechanisms that supports Activity of Daily Living(ADL) analysis and alert generation. We study how the incorporation of rule-based and case-based reasoning enables CARA to become more robust and to adapt to a changing environment by continuously retraining with new cases. Case study for evaluation of this hybrid reasoning framework is carried out under simulated but realistic smart home scenarios. The results indicate the feasibility of the framework for effective at-home monitoring.",

Different numerical analysis techniques were applied on the raw symptom data to extract clinically symptom information which in turn were then used in a machine learning process to be mapped to the standard clinician-based measures. The methods for quantitative and automatic assessment of symptoms were then evaluated for their clinimetric properties such as validity, reliability and sensitivity to change. Results from several studies indicate that the methods had good metrics suggesting that they are appropriate to quantitatively and objectively assess the severity of motor impairments of PD patients.",

		"abstract": "Targeting at modeling the high-level dynamics of pervasive computing systems, we introduce Bond Computing Systems (BCS) consisting of objects, bonds and rules. Objects are typed but addressless representations of physical or logical (computing and communicating) entities. Bonds are typed multisets of objects. In a BCS, a configuration is specified by a multiset of bonds, called a collection. Rules specifies how a collection evolves to a new one. A BCS is a variation of a P system introduced by Gheorghe Paun where, roughly, there is no maximal parallelism but with typed and unbounded number of membranes, and hence, our model is also biologically inspired. In this paper, we focus on regular bond computing systems (RBCS), where bond types are regular, and study their computation power and verification problems. Among other results, we show that the computing power of RBCS lies between LBA (linearly bounded automata) and LBC (a form of bounded multicounter machines) and hence, the regular bond-type reachability problem (given an RBCS, whether there is some initial collection that can reach some collection containing a bond of a given regular type) is undecidable. We also study some restricted models (namely, B-boundedness and 1-transfer) of RBCS where the reachability problem becomes decidable.",

In our approach, we represent the abstractions typical of each multi-agent system dimension as an ontology, and we exemplify both the use of such ontologies to model an eldercare application in the context of ambient intelligence and smart cities, as well as how the ontology concepts support coding in agent platforms.

		"abstract": "Applications for the control and automation of residential environments (domotics) are an emerging area of study within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). One of the related challenges is to design gestural interaction with these applications. This paper explores socio-technical aspects of gestural interaction in intelligent domotic environments. An analysis of literature in the area revealed that some HCI-related aspects are treated in a restricted manner that neglects socio-technical dimensions. We propose a framework for discussing related challenges in an integrated manner, considering the dimensions people, gestural mode of interaction, and domotics. Some of these challenges are addressed by literature outside the area of domotics. Many open research questions remain, e.g. how to design gestural vocabularies that minimize ambiguity and consider cultural and social aspects. The proposed framework might contribute to answering these questions thus to designing meaningful interaction that is intuitive and easy to learn.",

Height sensors are cheap, are convenient for the residents, are simple to install in an existing home, and are perceived to be less invasive than cameras or microphones. Height is typically only a weak biometric, but we show that it is well suited for identifying among a few residents in the home, and can potentially be improved by using the history of height measurements at multiple doorways in a tracking approach. We evaluate this approach using 20 people in a controlled laboratory environment and by installing in 3 natural, home environments. We combine these results with public anthropometric data sets that contain the heights of residents in 2077 elderly multi-resident homes to conclude that height sensors could potentially achieve at least 95% identification accuracy in 95% of elderly homes in the US.",

As a consequence, considerable shortcomings in availability, accessibility, and quality of health care can be expected. Telemedicine and telemonitoring services are promising approaches to compensate this gap, especially for long-term monitoring, nevertheless also within the supply chain of health care. Despite the potential, the acceptance of telemedicine is quite low. In this paper we report on two studies focusing on acceptance of telemedical services. First, chronically ill persons were experimentally studied with respect to their acceptance of telemedical systems. Second, a survey was conducted to assess medical professionals points of view. Findings reveal perceived benefits in the context of telemedical services, however, also considerable barriers, especially on the medical doctors side. Outcomes may contribute to the development of a sensitive and transparent communication and information strategy for stakeholders, as well as a public awareness for the benefits and the drawbacks of telemedical services.",

Our approach differs from existing approaches in three ways. First we improve context acquisition and understanding with the concept of micro-context that takes us beyond existing notions of location and temporal context; second, we incorporate plasticity concept into the human computer interface, in order to provide a natural interaction way and accommodative interface to the user; third we target robust and reliable systems that are easy to scale and deploy in diverse end-user settings, through the use of formal model building tools to specify and verify systems at key stages from requirements generation all the way to deployment and user statistics gathering. In order to address real-life end user requirements we are working closely with geriatric doctors and their staff, so as to get inputs as to precise challenges in caring for mild dementia patients, and how systems targeted at holistic, personalized assistance and care-giving can be built with a view towards scaled up deployment in diverse settings. The main contribution of this paper is an approach for system building that incorporates activity monitoring, user interface plasticity and scenario verification targeting people with cognitive decline in regards to a Singapore initiative called A-Star Home 2015 Phase II. We expect our work to lead to a methodology for systematic development of monitoring and assistive systems for cognitive interventions for mild dementia patients at home. Although the integrated framework is still not completely realized, the three areas mentioned above have each yielded significant results on their own, and these are mentioned in the paper.",

However, they are typically performed regardless of users situation and current activities. Factoring in the users contextual information which is relevant to their current or future energy consumption can significantly increase the effectiveness of DR programs and enable adaptive and personalized execution of DR control actions.

An overview of context reasoning and learning techniques for smart homes are presented to demonstrate how knowledge of user activities can be utilized in context-aware DR mechanisms.

In this paper we present a method of selecting which of a set of trained HMMs best matches the current observations, together with experiments showing that it can reliably detect and segment the sensor stream into behaviours. We demonstrate our algorithm on real sensor data obtained from the MIT PlaceLab. The results show a significant improvement in the recognition accuracy over other approaches.",

This methodology is based on the consistent and well-documented presentation of the information for each mobile AT application, after it is tested in an AT lab. mATHENA offers social interaction services for its diverse target groups. Moreover, we present the advantages of mATHENA compared with the functionalities of six other inventories for AT applications. Currently, mATHENA includes 420 free mobile AT applications, carefully selected among a total of 1,100.",

		"abstract": "The improvement of the conditions of daily life at home and work, promoted by the socio-economic progression, best quality private living environments and the immense development in healthcare and biomedical technologies has extended the average age of life beyond 70. According to recent surveys this population aging phenomenon will contribute to reach the record number of 1 billion people over 60 years on earth by the year 2020. Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents a remote home monitoring application called Living Assistant that could be utilized to continuously monitor and control a wide range of electronic appliances and ambient parameters. Basically it has been designed to function as a healthcare aide for elderly patients suffering from restricted mobility or other chronic diseases. The advanced ways of user interfaces presented in this paper are simple, generic and universally applicable. With little customization the application can be used to accommodate other user groups as well.",

Many of the common sensors today are binary, e.g. IR motion sensors, door close sensors, and floor pressure pads. Predicting user behavior is one of the key enablers for applications. While we consider smart home data here, the general problem is one of predicting discrete human actions. Drawing on Activity Theory, the language as action principle, and speech understanding research, we argue that smoothed n-grams are very appropriate for this task. We built such a model and applied it to data gathered from 3 smart home installations. The data showed a classic Zipf or power-law distribution, similar to speech and language. We found that the predictive accuracy of the n-gram model ranges from 51% to 39%, which is significantly above the baseline for the deployments of 16, 76 and 70 sensors. While we cannot directly compare this result with other work (lack of shared data), by examination of high entropy zones in the datasets (e.g. the kitchen triangle) we argue that accuracies around 50% are best possible for this task.",

Still, not much research is done to understand behavior patterns, temporal changes and other particularities that can affect the effectiveness of smart environments in ambient assisted living. We explored the behavior of two adults in a smart environment in order to reveal temporal, spatial and sequential relations among the activities as well as the changes that these relations undergo overtime and across individuals.

		"abstract": "Activity- and context-aware systems, as they are known, established, and well evaluated in small-scale laboratory settings for years and decades, suffer from the fact, that they are limited concerning the underlying data delivering entities. The sensor systems are usually attached on the body, on objects, or in the environment, directly surrounding persons or groups whose activities or contextual information has to be detected. For sensors that are exploited in this kind of systems, it is essential that their modalities, positions and technical details are initially defined to ensure a stable and accurate system execution. In contrast to that, opportunistic sensing allows for selecting and utilizing sensors, as they happen to be accessible according to their spontaneous availability, without presumably defining the input modalities, on a goal-oriented principle. One major benefit thereby is the capability of utilizing sensors of different kinds and modalities, even immaterial sources of information like webservices, by abstracting low-level access details. This emerges the need to roll out the data federating entity as decentralized collecting point. Cloud-based technologies enable space- and time-free utilization of a vast amount of heterogeneous sensor devices reaching from simple physical devices (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, as they are conventionally included on todays smart phones) to social media sensors, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This paper presents an opportunistic, cloud-based approach for large-scale activity- and context-recognition.",

In this paper, we intend to incorporate the location information in the activity recognition algorithm and see if it can help to improve the recognition accuracy. We propose two ways to bring the location information into the picture: one way is to bring location in the feature level, the other way is to utilize it to filter irrelevant sensor readings. Intensive experiments have been conducted to show that bringing location information into the activity recognition algorithm in both ways can help to improve the recognition rate by around 5% on average compared to the system neglecting the location information.",

While the underlying technology of eHealth technologies and Information and Communication technology (ICT) is quite similar, utilization contexts and using motives are quite different. In order to explore the role of technology type on acceptance, we contrasted central application characteristics of both technology types using the scenario technique. A questionnaire was administered (n = 104) measuring individual variables (age, gender) and attitudes regarding an eHealth application (blood sugar meter) in contrast to an ICT device (Personal Digital Assistant, PDA). Older users basically approved the utilization of health-related technologies and perceived lower usability barriers. In addition, we identified main utilization motives of eHealth technology and technology-specific acceptance patterns, especially regarding issues of data safety in the eHealth context. Effects of age and gender in acceptance ratings suggest a differential perspective on eHealth acceptance. Finally, practical interventions were derived in order to support eHealth device design and to promote acceptance of eHealth technology.",

If we assume the system is used in a fixed environment by multiple users for multiple navigation task over the course of days or weeks, then it is possible to take advantage of the user routine: from the initial navigational choice, users can be identified and their goal can be predicted. As a result of these prediction, the guidance system can bring its user to its destination while requiring less interaction. This property is particularly relevant for assisting disabled person for whom interaction is a long and complex task. In this paper, we implement a user guidance system using a dynamic Bayesian model and a topological representation of the environment. This model is evaluated with respect to the quality of its action prediction in a scenario involving 4 human users, and it is shown that in addition to the user identity, the goals and actions of the user are accurately predicted.",

Elderly people could clearly benefit from this concept. Thanks to smart environments, they can experience considerable enhancements, giving them an opportunity to live more independently and for longer in their home rather than in a health-care centre. However, to implement such a system, it is essential to know for whom we are designing. In this paper, we present an intelligent system with a monitoring infrastructure that will help mainly elderly users with impairments to overcome their handicap. The purpose of such a system is to create a safe and intuitive environment that will facilitate the achievement of household tasks in order to preserve independence of elderly residents for a while longer. Pursuing this goal, we propose to use the persona concept to help us build a user model based on the personas aptitudes. The practice of user modelling emphasizes the importance of user-centred techniques in any AmI system development and highlights the potential impacts of AmI for certain targeted groups - in this case, the elderly and people with disabilities.",

The aim of this AAL project is to enable senior citizens to live independently as long as possible. Two basic principles have been observed during the development of the AAL environment: first, in order to make the project a success it is crucial to consider both the needs and the wants of seniors. Second, health monitoring issues are important but the project will only be successful if it comes as a package with additional benefits (comfort, entertainment, safety, and communication). To provide these extra functionalities, the tablet PC-based PAUL -- the Personal Assistant Unit for Living -- has been developed. The HCI has been specifically designed for high ease of use and intuitive interaction. Moreover, PAUL also monitors the activities of daily living (ADL) and can generate alarms. The algorithms and automata used for this purpose are described in this paper.",

Secondly, we propose a Spatial Field constraint strategy to assist SVM-based exception action decision with a Bayesian inference model.

Some SOAs do not support features such as on-the-fly compositions or a searchable service directory. In this paper, we present a framework to compose and orchestrate services from different SOA implementations and provide the missing functionalities to support composition of heterogeneous SOAs.

		"abstract": "Assisted Living Systems with Ambient Intelligence technology raise new challenges to system and software engineering. The development of Assisted Living applications requires domain-oriented interdisciplinary research -- it is essential to know both the domain and the context. It is also important that context-descriptive prototypes are: (1) an integrated description that describes system, work processes, context of use; and (2) a formal description. Because (1), designers, including end users, are provided with a means to investigate the system in the context of the envisioned work processes. Because (2), investigations into questions of formalization and automation, not only of the system, but also of the work processes, can be made explicitly and become subject for discussions and further elaboration. Adapted engineering approaches are required to cope with the specific characteristics of ambient intelligent systems. Elderly are the most demanding stakeholders for IT-development -- even highly sophisticated systems will not be accepted when they do not address the real needs of the elderly and are not easily accessible and usable. Communication processes are essential in that respect. The evolution and, in particular, the spread of unambiguous symbols were an necessary postulate for the transfer of information, as for example in sign language, speech, writing, etc. In this paper, we report on our experiences in design, development and evaluation of computer applications in the area of ambient assisted living for elderly people, where, to our experiences, engineers highly underestimate the power of appropriate knowledge on semiotics and we demonstrate how we can emphasize universal access by thinking of informatics as semiotics engineering.",

This information can be used to automatically seek assistance to help the subject and decrease the negative effects of long-lie after a fall. Our approach does not require video monitoring or body worn kinematic sensors; hence preserves the privacy of the dwellers, reduces costs and eliminates the need to remember to wear a device.

New smart assistive technologies and Health Telematics make it possible to provide elderly with more security and well being at home. A smart home can automatically monitor home activities for early warning in health changes or detecting dangerous situations. One of our objectives is to design an automatic system to detect fall at home, which in its final version will be made up of a network of RGB-D sensors. In this paper, we present a simple and robust method based on the identification and tracking of the center of mass of people evolving in an indoor environment. Using a simple Hidden Markov Model whose observations are the position of the center of mass, its velocity and the general shape of the body, we can surprisingly monitor the activity of a person with high accuracy and thus detect falls with very good accuracy without false positives. An experimental study, that is reported here, has been driven in our smart apartment lab. 26 subjects were asked to perform a predefined scenario in which they realized a set of eight postures. 2 hours of video (216 000 frames) were recorded for the evaluation, half of it being used for the training of the model. The system detected the falls without false positives. This result encourages us to use this system in real situation for a better study of its efficiency.",

This paper postulates that such systems be designed with a number of requirements in mind, and in particular with safety, security and privacy as fundamental ones. It then correspondingly articulates the three main challenges behind the development of Independent Living Support systems: requirement elicitation, design and correctness analysis. It is found that requirement elicitation will have to cope with a large variety of issues; that design will have to proceed from modularity; and, notably, that correctness analysis will have to be socio-technical. The last finding in particular emphasises that, for a system that prescribes vast interaction with the human, system correctness only makes sense if the system is analysed in combination with the human, rather than in isolation from the human. Building upon previous experience with the socio-technical analysis of Internet browsers, this paper identifies the specific socio-technical challenges that Independent Living Support systems pose, and indicates an approach to succeed in taking them.",

Through detecting and distinguishing the abnormal behaviors of elders daily activities, the system provides assistance on elders independent living and improvement of aged quality of life.",

		"abstract": "The recognition of gestures performed by humans always attracted researchers that applied such algorithms in a broad range of disciplines. In particular, it was exploited on pervasive environments to enable simple communication with automation systems. In this paper, we present a novel gesture recognition algorithm that works under uncertainty. The algorithm is based on the tracking of passive RFID tags installed on everyday life objects. The method is able to perform the difficult task of segmentation and recognize basic directions within noisy dataset of positions. A set of tests was conducted in a realistic environment, and the results obtained are encouraging.",

In a comparative user study with 31 participants we evaluated five potential pairing techniques concerning their performance and acceptance for connecting to a public display and gained insights into the general requirements for pairing techniques in this special usage context. Besides four established mobile interaction techniques (touching an NFC tag, capturing a QR code, scanning, and manual input), our study considered a recent appropriate pairing technique called display pointing, which allows passers-by to connect to available displays just by pointing their smartphone at the installation, for the first time. Our results show that display pointing is superior to traditional alternatives to a large extent. Yet, its quick response times can result in a perceived lack of control if not handled appropriately. Further, we learnt that long distance techniques are generally preferred while the type of device gesture as well as security concerns are of less relevance.",

In this paper, the successful capture of the relationships between physiological and activity profile information is presented. Experiments have been designed to collect ECG data during the completion of five predefined everyday activities using wearable wireless sensors. The impact of these activities on heart rate has been captured through the analysis of changes in heart rate patterns. This has been achieved using CUSUM with change points corresponding to the transition between activities. From this initial analysis a future mechanism for context aware health status monitoring based on sensors is proposed.",

The notion of smart dust summarizes ubiquitous computing and sensing application systems, which can serve for local as well as global information acquisition and decision making. For off-the-shelf-nodes, and even more for dedicated physical designs, the system design process becomes increasingly challenging and potentially intractable. Automated design methods emerging for intelligent systems are introduced as a remedy. These considerations will be extended to variations, that multiple system instances have to face in real-world applications and potential compensation by incorporation of self-x properties. These concepts are elucidated for the case of reconfigurable and evolvable sensor electronics. Finally, an application perspective of the presented approach for integrated distributed sensing in home automation, assisted living, and in particular, smart kitchen applications, denoted as culinary assistance systems will be presented.",

These become a major issue at elder age making the elderly become dependent and susceptible to home accidents. The aim of this research is to increase the security, confidence and independence of the elderly as well as their relatives. To achieve such objective, this research proposes using a network of multiple Kinect sensors installed in different areas of a house monitoring the individual with the ability to interact with the person by voice or video, if required. The Kinect sensors analyze the everyday life and routines of the person. This analysis allows the individual to be traced, and means an automatic detection of risks in real time, decreasing the response time required in the event of a health emergency.",

Care policies (i.e. Event-Condition-Action rules) can be used to specify care services, facilitating changes in the behaviour of a home care system. Context modelling allows a user to specify the trigger and conditions of a care policy, using high-level context rather than raw sensor data. The actions of a care policy are, however, still dependent on the implementations details of actuators. We propose a framework that allows the actions of a care policy to be specified abstractly using human-understandable concepts. The framework takes care of discovering and using specific actuators, hiding the low-level home networking details from ordinary users. It therefore makes personalisation and modification of home care systems more accessible to ordinary users, requiring very little technical knowledge.",

Concepts such as quality of life, wellbeing, social interaction and connectivity are of crucial importance, and are directly linked to the home environment. The HOMEdotOLD project aims to provide a TV-based platform with cost-effective services that will be delivered in a highly personalised and intuitive way and will advance the social interaction of elderly people, aiming at improving the quality and joy of their home life, bridging distances and reinforcing social voluntariness and activation, thus preventing isolation and loneliness. The scope of the current paper is to present the aspired personal motivation and social networking services that HOMEdotOLD will deliver to its users, as well the conceptual architecture that will facilitate the provision of these services.",

The proposed project aims to reduce elderlys fears within their homes. As elderly potentially refuse or forget to wear any additional sensors to activate alarm calls, FEARLESS will visually and acoustically detect and handle risks by contacting the relatives or care taker organization automatically - without the need of any user intervention. This is done by using only one single type of sensor making the system affordable for everyone. It increases the feeling of safety, reduces fears, enhances the self-efficacy and thus enables elderly to be more active, independent and mobile in todays self-serve society.",

Manually building models of the user processes is a complex, costly and error-prone engineering task. Hence, the interest in automatically learning them from examples of actual procedures. Incremental adaptation of the models, and the ability to express/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks, are also desirable. First-order logic provides a single comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all of the above. This paper presents a First-Order Logic incremental method for inferring process models, and show its application to the users daily routines, for predicting his needs and comparing the actual situation with the expected one. Promising results have been obtained with both controlled experiments that proved its efficiency and effectiveness, and with a domain-specific dataset.",

The users location, posture, as well as point cloud -based features related to gestures are extracted; a standing/sitting posture detector, as well as novel features expressing head and hand gestures are introduced herein. To model the target activities, we employed discriminative HCRFs and compared them to HMMs. Through experimental evaluation, HCRFs outperformed HMMs in location trajectories-based ADL detection. By fusing trajectories data with posture and the proposed gesture features, ADL detection performance was found to further improve, leading to recognition rates at the level of 90.5 % for five target activities in a naturalistic home environment.",

For this purpose, we analyzed sound characteristics of typical home appliances using different processing techniques. We are using the acquired knowledge to develop a flexible set of features, which can be set manually or determined automatically. To classify the device-specific acoustic fingerprints -- consisting of a significant subset of our features -- we use established supervised learning techniques, whereby we optimized the straightforward ones. After building a recognition basis for the recognition of fixed length sound buffers on demand, we implemented a live recognition mode for real-time environment monitoring, providing runtime setup adjustments. We then extended our work with the recognition of untrained, simultaneously working, known devices by mixing their records, utilizing semi-supervised learning. We then anticipated promising results in our evaluation in various aspects, including recognition rate, performance for the different combinations of features, as well as to study the reliability of an automatic mixing of trained data.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes a participatory design-oriented study of an ambient assisted living system for monitoring the daily activities of elderly residents. The work presented addresses these questions 1) What daily activities the elderly participants like to be monitored, 2) With whom they would want to share this monitored data and 3) How a monitoring system for the elderly should be designed. For this purpose, this paper discusses the study results and participatory design techniques used to exemplify and understand desired ambient-assisted living scenarios and information sharing needs. Particularly, an interactive dollhouse is presented as a method for including the elderly in the design and requirements gathering process for residential monitoring. The study results indicate the importance of exemplifying ambient-assisted living scenarios to involve the elderly and so to increase acceptance and utility of such systems. The preliminary studies presented show that the participants were willing to have most of their daily activities monitored. However, they mostly wanted to keep control over their own data and share this information with medical specialists and particularly not with their fellow elderly neighbours.",

		"abstract": "Community care is a complex operation that requires the interaction of large numbers of dedicated individuals, managed by an equally wide range of organisations. They are also by their nature highly mobile and flexible, moving between clients in whatever order person receiving care is that they receive what they expect regularly, reliably and when they expect to receive it. Current systems are heavily provider focused on providing the scheduled care with as high apparent cost effectiveness as possible. Unfortunately, the lack of focus on the client often leads to inflexibility with expensive services being provided when they are not needed, large scale duplication of effort or inadequate flexibility to change the care regime to meet changing circumstances. Add to this the problems associated with the lack of integration of emergency and routing care and the extensive support given by friends and family and many opportunities exist to improve both the levels of support and the efficiency of care. The move towards Individual Care Plans requires much closer monitoring to ensure that the care specified for each individual is actually delivered and when linked with smart home technology in conjunction with appropriate sensors allows a much richer range of services to be offered which can be customised to meet the needs of each individual, giving them the assurance to continue to live independently.",

An area of particular interest within this domain relates to monitoring of Activities of Daily Living for those persons with a form of cognitive decline. In this area, specific tasks undertaken by the persons in the context of their normal day-to-day lives reveal a wealth of information to be used to customize their environment to improve their living experience. In our current work we investigate the development of models which can be used to represent, classify and monitor basic human behaviors and support observation and control of activities of daily living. In particular, in this paper we focus on the problem of automated recognition of sequences of events that may indicate critical conditions and unexpected behaviors requiring intervention and attention from caregivers. Our work is based on a formal framework developed with temporal logic used for the specification of critical sequences of patterns and a behavior checking engine for automated recognition. In addition we have also developed an approach to provide a means of interaction with user. A visual formalism for the specification of Linear Temporal Logic expressions reduces the barrier of technical complexity enabling the involvement of experts in the domain of healthcare services to interact with the system.",

Consequently, it is very much concerned with developing supporting technologies based on a comprehensive understanding of user needs. Meeting this objective will require us to address fundamental and long-term research challenges in how computing technologies and concepts relate and adapt to a range of everyday domestic environments, including those characterised as care settings. The Digital Care project employs a multidisciplinary research team to facilitate the development of enabling technologies to assist care in the community for particular user groups with different support needs. The general aim is to examine how digital technology can be used to provide various kinds of support to sheltered housing residents and their staff. Although the project anticipates exploring the affordances of a variety of technological configurations, including the use of virtual environments replicating real world situations and the use of handheld and wearable digital technology, the focus of this chapter is on our early work on providing support for the medication regime.",

		"abstract": "The growth in elderly population challenges technologists to develop applications explicitly designed for the elderly which are innovative yet intuitive to use. According to recent studies in Gerontology, one of the challenges that an elderly person has to confront is solitude and boredom. With the detectability of emotions through Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), one can provide reliable services to the elderly that address their emotional needs. In this paper the applications of the Emotiv EPOC, a BCI, is explained by developing a system called AWARE which helps mitigate loneliness in the life of an elderly and provides emergency services and other services based on their real-time emotional state. The AWARE system uses a model of computation that has taken pervasive computing to the next level by reducing the need for an explicit user input and facilitates the understanding of the users emotions by the system to address theirs emotional needs.",

However, usability issues often prevent elderly people from enjoying the benefits of modern technology, despite the amount of research to understand their needs in system design. In this work, we have performed a usability assessment of the BioAssist system, which is an integrated home care platform that incorporates both communication and health monitoring features.

We installed a video monitoring system for caregivers in three homes and observed the positive and negative effects of applying the system to caregiving. In terms of positive effects, the video monitoring system enabled caregivers to optimize their work and helped them concentrate on their tasks at hand, reducing both mental and physical stresses. On the other hand, some caregivers expressed concerns over being watched by other caregivers through the monitor, especially when their activities were recorded. We discuss these issues and explain how the concept of a Triage Support Environment may lead to a solution for these problems.",

This paper presents an algorithm of fall detection for the ageing-at-home of the elderly. This algorithm detects fall events by identifying (human) shape state change pattern reflecting a fall incident from video recorded by a single fixed camera. The novelty of the algorithm is multiple. First, it detects fall occurrence by identifying the state change pattern. Second, it uses the camera projection matrix in its computing. Thus, it eliminates camera setting-related learning. Lastly, it adds constraints to state change pattern to reduce false alarms. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a promising performance.",

In this domain, technological standardization is still in its infancy, or remains fragmented. The different functionalities of the various appliances, as well as market factors, imply that the devices that control them communicate via a multitude of different protocols (KNX, LonWorks, InOne). Building a high level middleware to support all the appliances seems to be a reasonable approach. However, market factors has shown that the emergence of a unique and universal middleware is a dream. To solve this issue, we have built a new generation of schizophrenic middleware in which service access can be generated from an abstract services description. EnTiMid, our implementation of schizophrenic middleware, supports various services access models (several personalities): SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UPnP and DPWS (Device Profile for WebServices). In this paper, we describe how these personalities are generated using a Model Driven Engineering approach and discuss the benefits of our approach in the context of a deployment of new services at the city level.",

		"abstract": "The concept of ambient intelligence (AmI) has recently been adopted related to living scenarios and denoted as ambient assisted living (AAL). It has received high attention related to the demographic shift and the positive options of care and support for elderly people at home and on the move. However, there exists an equally important field of application related to work. In the context of labour high mobility and flexibility of people is requested. The demand to work up to higher ages complements the situation. People in the workforce develop growing expertise and different abilities over time. They need tailored support systems at work keeping the efficiency and effectiveness and elements of prevention or adjustment to changing abilities. Indeed, environments in industry and at work provide already a high degree of networking and computing infrastructure, much more than in the private sector and can provide a basis for an advanced AmI infrastructure. The idea is discussed within the framework of creating accessible workplaces for people with disabilities. Here, so far a reactive strategy has been followed based on the individual case. Only in case a concrete person with a disability is included in the work force and only in that very moment a workplace adaptation is considered. However, now this reactive strategy is outdated, because today the complete infrastructure needs to be considered to make a workplace accessible. Following an AmI strategy --ambient assisted working (AAW) provides a flexible approach towards workplace adaptation for all, including people with disabilities and older people in the workforce. In order to use AAW, the process has to start much earlier in a more inclusive way. Without knowing the exact demands of a future worker, the system needs to be designed. The flexible networking character of AmI provides the required flexibility.",

		"abstract": "This pilot study aimed to confirm the feasibility of dispensing a balance exercise program by telerehabilitation in a post-stroke population and to evaluate participants satisfaction regarding the health care received. Four post-stroke participants were included. The intervention consisted of exercises inspired from Tai Chi movements, 45-minute sessions twice a week for 8 weeks. Fall-related clinical variables and health care satisfaction were assessed before, immediately after the intervention and two months later. Health care satisfaction was evaluated at the end of the intervention. All participants showed improvements for all of the variables measured: balance ($Delta$ between 1-6/56), fear of falling ($Delta$ between 3-17/60), motor function for the leg and postural control ($Delta$ between 1 and 2 stage), functional gait ($Delta$ between 11-47%), and lower limb strength ($Delta$ between 20-43%). Satisfaction was also high. The result supports the feasibility of in-home Tai Chi teletreatment as a valuable alternative for some stroke patients.",

Early scenarios in Ambient Intelligence envisioned a world in which individuals could maximally exploit personalized, context aware, wireless devices thus enabling them to become maximally productive, while living at an unprecedented pace. Environments would become smart and proactive, enriching and enhancing the experience of participants thus supporting maximum leisure possibly even at the risk of alienation. New insights have revealed that these brave new world scenarios are no longer desirable and that people are more in for a balanced approach in which technology should serve people instead of driving them to the max. We call this novel approach Synergetic Prosperity, referring to meaningful digital solutions that balance mind and body, and society and earth thus contributing to a prosperous and sustainable development of mankind.",

		"abstract": "The fast growing mobile sensor technology makes sensor-based lifelogging system attractive to the remote elderly care. However, existing lifelogging systems are weak at generating meaningful activity summaries from heterogeneous sensor data which significantly limits the usability of lifelogging systems in practice. In this paper, we introduce SensCare, a semi-automatic lifelog summarization system for elderly care. From various sensor information collected from mobile phones carried by elderlies, SensCare fuses the heterogeneous sensor information and automatically segments/recognizes users daily activities in a hierarchical way. With a few human annotations, SensCare generates summaries of data collected from activties performed by the elderly. SensCare addresses three challenges in sensor-based elderly care systems: the rarity of activity labels, the uncertainty of activity granularities, and the difficulty of multi-dimensional sensor fusion. We conduct a set of experiments with users carrying a smart phone for multiple days and evaluate the effectiveness of the automatic summary. With proper sensor configuration, the phone can continue to monitor users activities for more than 24 hours without charging. SensCare also demonstrates that unsupervised hierarchical activity segmentation and semi-automatic summarization can be achieved with reasonably good accuracy (average F1 score 0.65) and the system is very useful for users to recall what has happened in their daily lives.",

We can always turn to a dietitian (or a nutritionist) for professional diet suggestions if necessary. However, we cannot have a dietitian staying with us all the time, which renders daily nutrition control very challenging. Therefore, it is desirable for each individual to receive handy and informative diet suggestions whenever necessary. In this work, we propose a Context-aware Personal Diet Suggestion System (CPDSS) which tries to maximize an aggregated health utility function and provides useful diet suggestions according to some contextual information. In order to increase the practicality of the pro- posed system, we have integrated the CPDSS with an everyday appliance--a smart refrigerator--so that we can readily access the suggestions about ones diet, receive instant context-aware reminders while preparing foods, and keep long-term diet history to extract more useful pat- terns to caregivers to provide suggestions for health improvement.",

To aid in preventing premature loss of lives as well as lengthening life span, this research aims to implement the use of mobile and sensor technology to improve the quality of life and lengthen life expectancy. In particular, we propose a context-aware service framework for decision-support applications in preventive healthcare. This research applies ontology to support context modeling and reasoning by applying the general application areas for ontologies to the domain of context in ubiquitous computing environments. This paper also demonstrates how context technologies and mobile web services can help enhance the quality of services in preventive healthcare to elders.",

The intervention groups received once-weekly, one-hour therapy sessions targeting 3 mobility and 3 transfer tasks delivered either by Traditional In-Home Therapy or remote interactive Tele-Technology. Participants completed a 10-item, Likert scale measure of task self-efficacy at enrollment and after four weeks. Overall the intervention groups had a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy compared to the control. Comparisons between the two treatment delivery methods showed a medium standardized effect size (SES) in both groups compared to controls, although it did not reach statistical significance for the Tele group (SES Tele 0.35 [-2.5-.95]; Trad 0.54 [0.06-1.14]). Although further study is needed, this trend towards increased self-efficacy irrespective of the mode of rehabilitation delivery suggests that tele-rehabilitation can be a viable alternative to traditional in-home therapy.",

Quality of Context parameters can be used to cope with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the conflicting situations that a context-aware system may face at different layers of its conceptual design and present the conflict resolving policies that are defined on the basis of the Quality of Context parameters. We also illustrate how these policies can be used in different conflicting situations to improve the performance and effectiveness of context-aware systems.",

This paper proposes a framework for providing extensible, reactive and proactive behavior in Smart Environment systems. The focus of the present work is related to a specific class of Smart Environments: an Ambient Assisted Living. In this sense we define a framework and illustrate practical aspects of the use of framework by describing a home-care scenario in which the system observes the behavior of the user, as the time goes by, and detects relevant situations and acts reactively and proactively for preserving user health condition.",

Recently, task computing (TC) paradigm has gained acceptance as the choice computing model for pervasive computing environment. One of the key components of TC is a task model that provides an adequate high-level description of user-oriented tasks. This paper presents a novel context-sensitive task modeling approach capable of supporting complex, user-oriented task definitions, and proposes an algorithm to discover a task and a method to execute it. This work is motivated by the fact that whilst current TC systems allow users to interact with their ambient environments in terms of high level tasks, existing task definitions are still relatively simple, and do not include user-centric and environmental contextual information in the task definition. This paper elaborates the proposed task model through a smart home application example to illustrate steps in context-dependent task modeling, service provisioning and resource organization.",

Part of this is as a reaction to what is happening in the world; ubiquitous technologies are proliferating and transforming how we live our lives. We are becoming more connected and more dependent on technology. The home, the creche, outdoors, public places and even the human body are now being experimented with as potential places to embed computational devices, even to the extent of invading previously private and taboo aspects of our lives.

Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in aging-in-place scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner.

Concretely, the paper discusses the differences between Objects, Machines, and Artificial Objects. Through this, it reveals the characteristic of Artificial Objects and presents the following four points that can be potentially problematic with respect to the relationship between such objects and the elderly. Moreover, these points should also be kept in mind by engineering researchers when developing Artificial Objects. 1) Artificial objects move autonomously, and therefore users can not take the role of initiator. That is, people must accommodate to artificial objects. 2) Artificial objects still only have a limited learning ability for creating relationships with their users, including the understanding of contexts and a shared history not unlike that between people. 3) Even with increased leaning ability as a result of increased efficacy and expanded operating capacity, which in turn leads to the creation of better relationships between artificial objects and persons, there are limitations to such relationships. 4) There is a need to point out the problem of initially focusing too heavily on the functions that artificial objects should have. Especially for the elderly, engineers should take time to consider the relationships of dependency that the objects they design will gradually foster over time.",

		"abstract": "Long term eldercare is often labor intensive. This paper addresses a multimodal sensing approach to situation awareness for elderly care using video and force sensitive resistor (FSR) sensor map. For elderly people, especially those with limited mobility, it is useful to keep care givers or family members known of their situations that may lead to abnormal patterns such as repeated action (get up and sit down) or hazardous result such as a falling from bed. By using multimodal sensing with video camera and FSR sensor, the situation awareness algorithm is proposed to detect and track human activities. Experiments have shown the effectiveness of the detection of primary situations for elderly care.",

The graph-based approaches are generating feature vectors using frequent subgraphs for classification by an SVM, an SVM using a graph kernel and nearest neighbor approach using a graph comparison measure. None demonstrate significantly superior accuracy compared to the non-graph SVM, but all demonstrate strongly uncorrelated error both against the base SVM and each other. An ensemble is created using the non-graph SVM, Frequent Subgraph SVM, Graph Kernel SVM, and Nearest Neighbor. Error is shown to be highly uncorrelated between these four. This ensemble substantially outperforms all of the approaches alone. Results are shown for a 10-class problem arising from smart environments, and a 2-class one-vs-all version of the same problem.",

Depending on the demographic change it wont be possible to realize complete care by formal or informal caregivers especially for people living alone. One possible way to cope this problem is to use ICT based solutions e.g. mobile service robots. The personal in-house mobility and its preservation it is one goal to enable staying as long as possible in her/his own flat. The concept of an automated housing enabling assessment which is presented here is an advanced solution for this problem. It is based on three main components: (1) Measurement and analysis of the cognitive and physical capabilities of the user, (2) Measurement and validation of the flat and (3) Computation of areas with a higher risk to fall and advice to remove such issues, e.g. restructuring of the furniture. The great benefit of a mobile robot platform is that all needed sensors are mounted on the robot and it can follow the user to make measurements at different places in the home. This will reduce the cost and installation effort in the flat to a minimum. Another benefit is the continuous assessment which helps to restructure the flat in a continuous way. This helps to reduce the probability of a fall event and raise the feeling of safety. All measurements could also be used by other assessment tools to preserve the indoor mobility not only by preventing a fall event but also by reacting on changes in the mobility level over time.",

Assistive applications can ease the effects of dementia by assuming and supporting impaired functions. Context-awareness is an accepted paradigm for assistive applications. It enables interactive systems to react appropriately to situations that occur during daily routines of people with dementia. However, there currently is no recommended framework to view symptoms of dementia in terms of context and context-awareness. The aim of this paper is to inform designers in the early design stages of assistive applications how requirements and needs of people with dementia can be represented in a context-aware application. Based on a systematic literature review, we elicit which context types are linked to the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers and how they are used in existing assistive applications in dementia care. Our focus is on applications evaluated and assessed with people with dementia. We also classify these assistive applications by the offered context-aware services. We observe that these should not be limited within the realm of the local residence; context types that are valuable in-house can, to a certain extent, also be leveraged outside a local residence. We believe the proposed framework is a tool for application builders and interface designers to accomplish an informed design of systems for people with dementia.",

Thus, uses of Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems can represent key solution for obtaining adaptive interfaces and systems. Modeling such complex systems is some time to computational intensive thats why we have proposed the use of hardware implemented neural networks. Using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) for hardware implementation allows parallel implementation of neurons increasing the processing speed. This paper aims to present the method developed by the authors for implementing artificial neural networks, the results obtained and the possibility of use in some applications experimented by the authors support independent life of elderly people.",

This paper explores these applications and the portrayal of people with disabilities within the social robotics discourse. Our review of social robotics literature revealed that social robotics mainly portrays disabled people through a medical/body ability deficiency lens, namely identifying deficient abilities, and then proposing how a certain robot can fix them and give the individual normal functioning. However, within the Disabled People Rights Movement, the academic field of disability studies, and existing legal documents, a second narrative is evident which focuses less on fixing the person to the species-typical norm, and more on increasing the participation in society of that person the way they are. We submit that the second type of narrative and its way of defining problems and solutions needs more visibility within the social robotics discourse and in the vision of possible products.",

Outcomes show that acceptance factors are neither static nor independent from the specific usage or service context in which a technology is applied.

Designing the underlying perceptual systems is a non-trivial task which involves interdisciplinary effort dealing with the integration of voice and image recognition technologies, situation modeling middleware, and context-aware interfaces into a robust and self-manageable software framework. To support fast development and tuning of dialog-based services, we introduce a simulation framework compliant with the proposed architecture. The framework is capable of gathering information from a broad set of sensors, of an event-based abstraction of such information, interaction with an integrated dialog system, and of a virtual representation of a smart environment in schematic 2D or realistic 3D projections. We elaborate on use-cases of architecture model referring the two projects where our system was successfully deployed.",

A functional subarea mapping approach was proposed based on both a coarse-grained and a fine-grained method. Experimental results indicated that the coarse-grained mapping provided a higher overall accuracy of location detection. The average subarea location accuracy achieved based on coarse-grained and fine-grained data was 85.4% and 68.7%, respectively. Nevertheless it was found that the fine-grained mapping approach was capable of providing more information in relation to the details of the functional subareas. This implies that we need to balance the requirements between the size of the subareas and the location accuracy.",

Though, acceptance criteria differ not only across the diversity of users, but might also differ across the different usage context. This is especially valid for technologies in the health and beauty context, in which the balance between pro-using arguments and contra-using arguments is especially fragile. This paper focuses on the impact of the context towards the motivation to use an invasive technology. A survey was conducted in which 170 participants of a wide age range (17-89 years) took part. In the study, three different usage scenarios were presented (medical scenario, preventative healthcare scenario and beauty scenario). After an introduction into each scenario the participants had to evaluate usage motives and barriers. The results corroborated the impact of the situational context and the dependency of acceptance outcomes on the reasons for which technology might be used. Overall, acceptance was highest for medical technology and lowest for the beauty context. Considering the single reasons for or against the technology, we find that nature and weighing of perceived barriers and concerns are quite similar, independently of the context.",

Participants were led to believe that the research entailed a subjective evaluation of the eye tracking glasses. A researcher wore one of two wearable sensors during the evaluation enabling us to measure the extent to which participants fixated on the sensor during a one-on-one meeting. Results are presented on the general visibility and potential fixations on two wearable sensors, a wrist-work actigraph and a lifelogging camera, during normal conversation between two people.

The analysis draws on our review of more than 70 AmI projects, principally in Europe. It notes the visions as well as the specifics of typical AmI scenarios.

The flats are regular dwellings for long-term use by approximately 30 tenants located in Kaiserslautern, Germany. In this real-world AAL project it was shown that basic inactivity alarms based on linear thresholds can be triggered within 30 to 180 minutes after the occurrence of a potential emergency. However, inactivity alarms are somewhat coarse and do not make full use of additional information inherent in the raw sensor data: spatial and temporal information regarding the location of a tenant in their flat and the time spent in a room. Using that information, it can be determined in which room a tenant has resided for how long at a given time. Hence, in this paper a method for location tracking is proposed, forming a novel alarming criterion.",

While theoretical explanations of the rule variations are explained, there is a lack of empirical comparisons of the DS theory and its variations against real data sets. In this work, we examine several variations to DS theory. Using two real-world sensor data sets, we compare the performance of DS theory and several of its variations in recognising situations.

		"abstract": "This paper presents the design phase of a work aiming at designing and developing a smart living device for seniors to assist them in their daily outdoor activities. We follow a participative design approach based on scenarios in order to design a socially-adapted device that will be useful to improve seniors life. To specify our system, we first provide an UML scenario metamodel to abstract all the concepts involved in our system collaborative functioning (interactions with stakeholders, environment ldots). This metamodel is used to generate different scenarios in order to better define future users needs and the system requirements and notably its behavior (represented with BPMN and Petri Nets). A scenario generator has been implemented for that purpose. Finally, we show how to simulate and analyze those generated scenarios using process mining techniques.",

		"abstract": "A video monitoring system is presented which aims to detect falls and other critical situations of people living single. Seniors are particularly likely to experience high-risk situations. If, for example, an elderly person falls and cannot call for help independently, it often takes hours or even days until the emergency is noticed and assistance will be provided. The presented video monitoring system is to mitigate situations of this kind. If an emergency is detected, an automatic alarm will be raised. One of the main aspects of the developed assistance system is to be as unobtrusive as possible to achieve a high acceptance among the users. Moreover, the system needs to work very robustly in individual home environments. The fall detection system is part of an extensive real-life Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) concept with many other extended support functions.",

The effects of different cultures, but also of age, gender and health status were analyzed regarding their impact on acceptance patterns. Results reveal both, culturally insensitive as well culturally sensitive acceptance, with strong effects of gender and exercising frequency.

From a technical point of view, implants are far-developed and will enter the market in the next years. From a human factors point of view, there is a considerable lack of acceptance-related knowledge and understanding of perceived benefits and barriers across a diverse population. Using a qualitative approach, this study gains insights into public perceptions of implantable medical technology, the level of information revealing misconceptions and basic fears. It thus explores cognitive and affective factors that form the acceptance of implantable medical technology.

This paper presents a context-aware healthcare system which makes use of multi-modal and un-obtrusive sensing technology meanwhile taking human feeling into account. Specifically, we choose ambient sensors such as pressure straps and a laser scanner to monitor both the activity of the elder and his/her surroundings.

However, current access control models remain unsuitable due to lack of completeness, flexibility and adaptability to the user capability and behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptable access control model (UBC-ACM) and its related architecture (UBC-ACA) in which the security policy is based on the users behavior and capability to grant a service using any assistive device within intelligent environment. The design of our model is an ontology-learning and evolving security policy for predicting the future actions of dependent people.

Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote socialization in shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. In order to understand socializations in these shared spaces, surveillance systems must be developed to quantify the number and type of interactions in an environment. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using multiple cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an automatic behavioral mapping surveillance system designed for monitoring interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities shared common areas. Specific emphasis is given to the system designed to monitor the number, length and type of interactions of older adults in the community.",

		"abstract": "Medical researchers are constantly looking for new methods for early detection and treatment of incurable diseases. Cancer can severely hinder the lives of patients if they are not constantly attended to. Cancer patients can be assisted with the aid of constant monitoring by a support group and a continual sense of self-awareness through monitoring, which can be enabled through pervasive technologies. As human life expectancy rises, incidents of cancer also increase, which most often affects the elderly. Cancer patients need continuous follow-up because of the state of their disease and the intensity of treatment. Patients have often restricted mobility, thus it is helpful to provide them access to their health status without the need to travel. There has been much effort towards wireless and internet based health care services, but they are not widely accepted due to the lack of reliability and usability. In this paper, we present a software called Wellness Monitor (WM). The purpose of WM is to utilize the portability and ubiquity of small handheld devices such as PDAs, cell phones, and wrist watches to ensure secured data availability, customized representation, and privacy of the data collected through small wearable sensors. WM explores how the social and psychological contexts that encompass the patients could be enhanced by utilizing the same technology, an aspect which is mostly unexplored. A further goal was to provide continuous psychological assistance.",

Based on a graphic representation of the DST called evidential networks, we propose a structure of heterogeneous multi-sensor fusion for falls detection.

CARA aims to provide efficient healthcare services by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. This system can continuously measure physiological signals, and either store the data on the server or stream the data to a remote location in real-time. A design goal of ubiquitous access has prompted the design of the system as a rich internet application. The only tool required is a web browser with the commonly-available Adobe Flash plug-in installed. Thus the system enables access and analysis on any internet-connected PC or appropriate smart device, independent of geographic location. The remote monitoring and data review applications of CARA are presented at as the main implementation examples. The results of experiments using the system are presented.",

In the approach, patients collect relevant medical data periodically using personalized mobile healthcare system (PMHS) and share the data with clinical institutions to be compliant with the meaningful use of medical records. The collected medical data and measurement results are analyzed and the analysis result may be used to come up with personalized recommendations for preventing healthy people to become chronic disease patient. The ontology focuses on organizing measurement results semantically. For semantic use of the collected medical records, we have used Protege-OWL for building ontology and used SPARQL query to retrieve meaningful information from the patient-provided medical data.",

		"abstract": "Ambient systems may support the elderly in many aspects of their lives, bringing new level of comfort, higher safety, and better health. But, as we revealed in parallel research on deep design, there are dissonances in what do the elderly wish and what the intelligent technologies indeed offer. The dissonances may lead to reluctant acceptance or even to rejection of possibly beneficial products. In this paper we borrowed concepts from economics and transformed them into generic model which captures the mental process of evaluation of new aspects of life. Proposed model is specifically aimed on ambient intelligence products, viewed from the eyes of possible elderly users, though not necessarily limited to this particular focus. The process of evaluation, leading either to acceptance or to rejection, may be described as a sequence of rational selections from available options, based on perceived benefit (utility) and cost (in terms of time, effort, support from others). Simplifying preconditions introduced in the paper reduce the model to optimization problem of linear programming. In conclusions we discuss limitations of the model and suggest further possible refinements and evaluation.",

Existing algorithms focus on the first sub-problem and on finding city-level locations. We use a principled approach in adapting Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to provide a first solution for finding significant places within the home, based on the first set of long-term, precise location data collected from several homes. We also present a novel metric for quantifying the similarity between places, which has the potential to assign semantic labels to places by comparing them to a library of known places. We discuss several implications of these new techniques for the design of Ubicomp systems.",

Most pairing protocols rely for their security on a certain advantage that the legitimate devices have over any malicious users. Such advantages include proximity (employing near-field communication) or secret keys that are either produced with the assistance of, or verified by, the legitimate user. The advantage exploited by our novel AP protocol is the amount of uninterrupted time spent by the two devices in the proximity (although not requiring near-field communication) of each-other. We discuss several implementation configurations, all based on pseudo-random bit generators, employing short-length LFSRs, and requiring no more than 2000 transistors. This makes the protocol ideally suited for low-cost passive RFID tags. For each configuration we show that the AP protocol is highly secure against occasional malicious entities.",

We conducted a user study involving experiential interaction with the robot, which oriented its display in the direction of the users voice, and also tracked the users face once it is in view of the robots camera. A questionnaire was given to gather the opinions of the participants regarding the usability of the robot for the elderly, and their responses indicate a positive attitude, acceptance, and trust towards the attention-directed robot. By comparing the responses of subjects with different levels of video-conferencing experience, we found that subjects who video-conference more frequently tend to be more accepting of the robot. Furthermore, they indicated an acceptable price of the robot as less than the price of a tablet, and most of them expressed the desire to buy the robot in the near future.",

The paper proposes a bottom-up approach that is focused on human basic instincts: forage, vigilance, reproduction, intuition and learning. They are the machine codes in human operating systems, where high-level programs, such as social functions can override the low-level instinct. However, instinctive computing has been always a default operation. Instinctive computing is the foundation of Ambient Intelligence as well as Empathic Computing.

To assist the independent living of these individuals and decrease the caregiver burden have become an important public health concern in the future. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive function and dementia. The symptoms of MCI include difficulty remembering recent events or recently acquired information, depression and anxiety. MCI also increases the fall risk and affects patients social function and behavior. Sufficient physical activities can improve health of brain and reduce the risk of MCI. Since the context-aware computing technologies for assisting living have gained great popularity. We proposed a context-based activity prompting system to improve quality of life for MCI patients. The proposed system utilizes a smart phone as a sensor device to transmit sensing data to cloud server for activity recognition and activity level estimation, and uses context-based technique to provide activity prompting message to MCI patients. The activity prompting service supplies the activities self-management for MCI patients and helps them living independently. The system also provides real time fall detection mechanism to shorten the rescue time when accident happened. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed system achieves high accuracy on activity recognition and activity level estimation.",

In this study, such a system was established by developing a cost-effective, safe and easy to use mobile robot. With such a robotic monitoring system, the in-hospital time for most MIPs and the burden to therapists can be significantly decreased. In order to realize the robotic monitoring system, we proposed several algorithms to solve the difficulties arising from the mobile sensing for moving MIPs, and recognize several frequent daily living activities, including impaired walking. Concretely, algorithms to use both color images and depth images was proposed to improve the accuracy of MIPs measurement, and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was implemented to deal with the uncertainty on time sequence data and relate the state transitions over time for daily living activity recognition. Experiments have demonstrated promising results on joint trajectory measurement, and recognition of daily living activities.",

We consider this system to be one member of an important new class of human activity monitoring approaches based on what we call infrastructure mediated sensing, or home bus snooping. Our solution leverages the existing ductwork infrastructure of central heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems found in many homes. Disruptions in airflow, caused by human inter-room movement, result in static pressure changes in the HVAC air handler unit. This is particularly apparent for room-to-room transitions and door open/close events involving full or partial blockage of doorways and thresholds. We detect and record this pressure variation from sensors mounted on the air filter and classify where certain movement events are occurring in the house, such as an adult walking through a particular doorway or the opening and closing of a particular door. In contrast to more complex distributed sensing approaches for motion detection in the home, our method requires the installation of only a single sensing unit (i.e., an instrumented air filter) connected to an embedded or personal computer that performs the classification function. Preliminary results show we can classify unique transition events with up to 75-80% accuracy.",

In particular, FSR sensor is a typical noninvasive sensor since it has a shape of film. In order to make a light-weight monitoring system, we use as small number of sensors as possible.

The dynamic nature of the implementations present a challenging problem when attempting to model or learn a model of the environment. Training data to construct the model must be within the same feature space and have the same distribution as the target task data, however this is often highly costly and time consuming. There can even be occurrences were a complete lack of labelled target data occurs. It is within these situations that our study is focussed.

Technical expertise is assumed to positively influence the acceptance of modern technologies, and there is evidence within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector for this. While no one would seriously dispute this basic impact of technical expertise on technology acceptance, it is far from clear what the main drivers of technical expertise are. In order to understand the complex nature of expertise on the one hand and its impact on the acceptance of other technology domains on the other, an empirical approach was undertaken. 100 participants (19-75 years) participated in a survey, in which the acceptance of a medical mobile device was explored. Outcomes show (1) that technical expertise is a highly complex construct entailing different facets (knowledge, motivational, emotional and pragmatic components), which are influenced by age and gender of respondents (2) technical expertise in the ICT domain decisively modulates acceptance of medical technology. Interestingly, a low technical expertise does not only reduce the acceptance of the pro-using arguments, but is specifically related to a high confirmation of contrausing arguments.",

		"abstract": "Context-aware applications rely on implicit forms of input, such as sensor-derived data, in order to reduce the need for explicit input from users. They are especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing environments, in which user attention is at a premium. To support the development of context-aware applications, techniques for modelling context information are required. These must address a unique combination of requirements, including the ability to model information supplied by both sensors and people, to represent imperfect information, and to capture context histories. As the field of context-aware computing is relatively new, mature solutions for context modelling do not exist, and researchers rely on information modelling solutions developed for other purposes. In our research, we have been using a variant of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to model context. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences and outline some research challenges in this area.",

Our key contributions are new between-skeleton distance measures for risk discovery and two series of experiments with our onboard clustering.

Moreover, we use context similarity measures to handle the intrinsic characteristics of pervasive environments in real-world conditions, such as missing information, temporal inaccuracies or activities that can be performed in several ways. We illustrate the performance of the proposed framework through its deployment in a hospital for monitoring activities of Alzheimers disease patients.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we present an ontology-based approach in designing knowledge model for context recognition (CR) systems. The main focus in this paper is on the use of an ontology to facilitate the generation of user-based queries to the CR system. By leveraging from the ontology, users need not know about sensor details and the structure of the ontology in expressing queries related to events of interest. To validate the approach and demonstrate the flexibility of the ontology for query generation, the ontology has been integrated in two separate application domains. The first domain considers a health care system implemented for the GiraffPlus project where the query generation process is automated to request information about activities of daily living. The second application uses the same ontology for an air quality monitoring application in the home. Since these two systems are independently developed for different purposes, the ease of applying the ontology upon them can be considered as a credit for its generality.",

Inside a smart house, cognitive assistance could alleviate cognitive impairments by giving personalized environmental cues. Besides telemonitoring could inform relatives and medical staff of the disease evolution and could alert them in case of emergency. But cognitively impaired people must not be confined in their home. Cognitive assistance and telemonitoring must be available outdoors too.

The agent acts as coordinators of Web services that implement the four stages of the case-based planning cycle.

We analyse motion data recordings from wearable inertial measurement units of eleven patients up to eleven days, totally 102 recording days. Using logic rules, we extract activity primitives, including affected arm move, sit, stand, walking, etc. from selected channels of the continuous median-filtered sensor data. Using relative duration of the activity primitives, we examine patient activity patterns regarding independence in mobility, distribution of walking over the days and trends in using the affected body side. Due to the heterogeneity of patients behaviour, we focused on analysing patient-specific activity patterns. Our exploration showed that the rule-based activity primitive analysis is beneficial to understand individual patient activity.",

In this paper, we propose a framework that can support impromptu service discovery and context-aware service access with mobile devices in heterogeneous assistive environments. Different from the existing approaches, the framework requires no specialized hardware or software installation in mobile client devices, it can automatically generate personalized user interfaces based on context such as user preference and device capability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we prototyped a set of assistive services in public spaces like shopping malls, leveraging the OSGi-based platform accessible from any WLAN enabled mobile devices.",

DSM requires the combination of stream operators, which may run on different distributed devices, into stream processes. Due to the recent advantages in sensor technologies and wireless communication, the amount of information generated by DSM will increase significantly. In order to efficiently deal with this streaming information, Digital Library (DL) systems have to merge with DSM systems. Especially in healthcare, the continuous monitoring of patients at home (telemonitoring) will generate a significant amount of information stored in an e-health digital library (electronic patient record). In order to stream-enable DL systems, we present an integrated data stream management and Digital Library infrastructure in this work. A vital requirement for healthcare applications is however that this infrastructure provides a high degree of reliability. In this paper, we present novel approaches to reliable DSM within a DL infrastructure. In particular, we propose information filtering operators, a declarative query engine called MXQuery, and efficient operator checkpointing to maintain high result quality of DSM. Furthermore, we present a demonstrator implementation of the integrated DSM and DL infrastructure, called OSIRIS-SE. OSIRIS-SE supports flexible and efficient failure handling to ensures complete and consistent continuous data stream processing and execution of DL processes even in the case of multiple failures.",

Large scale quantitative studies to understand the adoption of AmI appliances are scarce. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to examine how the Dutch people (n = 1221) perceive AmI appliances for domestic settings. Findings show that intention to adopt AmI appliances was low and that respondents had a negative to neutral attitude towards AmI appliances. On the basis of structural equation analysis, results suggest that adoption of AmI appliances could be explained by outcome expectancies of AmI appliances. The potential implications of the findings are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be taken as one of the principal test beds for the integration of Systems, Humans and Cybernetics. Multi-agent based Ambient Intelligence solutions have proliferated in the last few years in order to cope with the intrinsically distributed and complex interaction based nature of the problem. Different multi-agent platforms have been used in this regard, being JADE one of the standard solutions adopted due the variety of services it provides and to its FIPA compliance. Nevertheless, JADE was designed as a general Multi-agent platform and not for the particular demands of AmI systems. Consequently, its behavior in this realm is not as optimal as it could be. In this paper, we analyze some of the problems JADE presents for its application to AmI, especially in terms of communications, and describe some of the extensions we have developed in order to solve them. The resulting system exhibits enhanced communication capabilities, promotes the division of tasks into decoupled components and makes component reutilization easy. This platform constitutes an environment with tools for the development and deployment of AmI applications.",

Appropriate types of reactions depend on in how far an ambient agent is able to interpret the available information (which is often incomplete, and hence multi-interpretable) in order to create a more complete internal image of the environment, including humans. This interpretation process, which often has multiple possible outcomes, can make use of an explicitly represented model of causal and dynamic relations. Given such a model representation, the agent needs a reasoning method to interpret the partial information available by sensoring, by generating one or more possible interpretations. This paper presents a generic model-based default reasoning method that can be exploited to this end. The method allows the use of software tools to determine the different default extensions that form the possible interpretations.",

Understanding individual arguments and to reach a high usage rate of these vehicles in the public and a broad acceptance, the identification of possible pro-using motives as well as perceived drawbacks is essential, which would allow a sensitive and individually-tailored communication and information policy. Using an exploratory approach, a questionnaire study was carried out in which participants were requested to indicate the level of acceptance and the intention to use electric cars. The questionnaire items were taken from several focus groups, which had been carried out prior to the questionnaire study. Outcomes show that the traditional car is perceived still as much more comfortable, and receives a high trustfulness in comparison to electric cars. In addition, user diversity in terms of age and gender was found to considerably the perceived benefits and barriers. Female users but also aged persons show a higher level of acceptance, which might be due to their higher environmental consciousness in contrast to male persons and younger participants. Interestingly, the self-reported level of domain knowledge (significantly higher in men) did not show a large influence on the level of acceptance.",

We found that our device was comfortable, stable and had aesthetic appeal for users during monitoring. To develop an affective shape, and to increase comfort, we applied a user-centered design process. We also used context-based physiological signal analysis to obtain stable analysis results according to individual users. As an application, we developed a rainbow ambient display to give visual feedback to users. We expect that this product can be applied in various healthcare applications.",

		"abstract": "Todays societies are very different from those of the past. The proportion of elderly people is growing steadily and has reached highs never reached before. Cases of dementia have also risen as the population gets older. Family members often live far apart and it is not unusual for them to be scattered in more than one country or continent. Memory loss associated with ageing (and amplified in cases of dementia) as well as a general feeling of isolation caused by distance can often lead elderly people to depression. We believe that, if used properly, technology could provide elders with powerful memory aids and social interaction tools that could improve their quality of life. In this article, we propose the use of a special interactive calendar with enhanced functionalities that can help manage a schedule, keep in touch with family members living far away, and reminisce about past events.",

Surface MMG signals acquired from the flexor carpi ulnaris, brachioradialis supinator and abductor pollicis longus. The MMG is processed and wavelet based features are extracted which are classified into eight different forearm movements using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier. A classification efficiency of 90.2 % is achieved using the MLP classifier. The MMG system is designed to measure data using accelerometers built into the assistive device and, hence, doesnt require any active involvement of the elderly.",

This paper presents a gesture based approach to control devices and their functionalities in a smart environment at a semantic level to issue a command or to set a level.

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) envisions ubiquitous, intuitive human-machine interaction running on heterogeneous devices (tablets, televisions, smart-phones, etc.) and by means of multiple modalities (graphics, voice, gesture recognition, etc.). This vision often represents a strong technological challenge for any developer of AAL services. In order to relieve the developer from the burden of repeatedly adapting the interfaces, the universAAL platform [6] offers a framework for user interaction that separates the content, that is exchanged between the user and the application, and its actual representation. The main drawback of this solution is that it delegates all the responsibility of the representation of the content to the platform, which, in turn, must be able to adapt to all kinds of showable messages. This paper explains how a so-called UI Handler has been designed and implemented to render messages in universAAL, as well as the results of its technical and usability evaluations.",

While several approved methods for sleep disturbance exist, most are not suitable for use within the abovementioned population. Often the reason for this is due to the symptoms associated with cognitive impairment or for the invasiveness of some sleep profiling methods. Developed from current sleep actigraphy techniques, this paper presents a non-contact alternative method for sleep profiling that is deemed to be more suitable for long term monitoring in the older population than current clinically approved techniques. This first evaluation has been conducted with a young control group in order to validate the approach. The results have demonstrated that based on the approach a random forest classifier using features calculated from optimally placed static accelerometers can produce a sleep/wake classification accuracy of 92%.",

The uncertainty of the execution environment is a major motivation for dynamic adaptation; it is impossible to know at development time all of the possible combinations of environmental conditions that will be encountered. To date, the work performed in requirements engineering for a DAS includes requirements monitoring and reasoning about the correctness of adaptations, where the DAS requirements are assumed to exist. This paper introduces a goal-based modeling approach to develop the requirements for a DAS, while explicitly factoring uncertainty into the process and resulting requirements. We introduce a variation of threat modeling to identify sources of uncertainty and demonstrate how the RELAX specification language can be used to specify more flexible requirements within a goal model to handle the uncertainty.",

Using smartphones as platform facilitates collection of naturalistic daily activity, which is difficult to collect with multiple on-body sensors or array of sensors affixed to indoor locations. However, recognizing daily activities in unconstrained settings is more challenging than in controlled environments: 1) multiples heterogeneous sensors equipped in smartphones are noisier, asynchronous, vary in sampling rates and can have missing data; 2) unconstrained daily activities are continuous, can occur concurrently, and have fuzzy onset and offset boundaries; 3) ground-truth labels obtained from the users self-report can be erroneous and accurate only in a coarse time scale. To handle these problems, we present in this paper a flexible framework for incorporating heterogeneous sensory modalities combined with state-of-the-art classifiers for sequence labeling. We evaluate the system with real-life data containing 11721 minutes of multisensory recordings, and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system for practical lifelogging applications.",

		"abstract": "Movement-based and exertion interfaces assume that their users move. Users have to perform exercises, they have to dance, they have to golf or football, or they want to train particular bodily skills. Many examples of those interfaces exist, sometimes asking for subtle interaction between user and interface and sometimes asking for brute force exertion interaction between user and interface. In these interfaces it is often the case that the interface mediates between players of a game. Obviously, one of the players may be a virtual human. We provide a state of the art survey of such interfaces and in particular look at intelligent exertion interfaces, interfaces that know about their users and even try to anticipate what their users prepare to do. That is, we embed this interface research in ambient intelligence and entertainment computing research, and the interfaces we consider are not only mediating, but they also add intelligence to the game. Other issues that will be discussed are flow and engagement for exertion interfaces. Intelligent exertion interfaces, being able to know and learn about their users, should also be able to provide means to keep their users engaged and in the flow of the game and entertainment experience. Unlike the situation with traditional desktop game research where we can observe lots of research activity trying to define, interpret and evaluate issues such as flow and immersion, in movement-based interfaces these concepts need to be reconsidered and new ways of evaluation have to be defined.",

Continuous monitoring and information processing tools are vital to a physician with several patients under his care. In this work, a system that relies on agents and mobile and wireless devices is presented. Its use with small scale sensors allows to collect and analyse vital data in real-time, triggering appropriate reactions in case of eminent danger. This includes real-time notifications to practitioners. In cases in which the physician is unable to divide his attention among all his patients, the system is able to drive his attention to one patient only and, when it is necessary, to another one, according to their medical state. This concept represents a breakthrough in terms of the physicians time and task management, being possible to apply it two major scenarios: patient recovery in a hospital environment or elderly living alone in a domestic environment. In that sense, we present a brief contextualiation of the problem as well as the architecture and technologies used to implement the proposed work.",

In this study, in order to realize effective bio-monitoring robots, we investigated 1) color based particle filter subject tracking with proposed depth likelihood integration to control the weights of particles; 2) control schemes for acquiring stable image sources for further human motion analysis, especially, the algorithms for reducing the camera vibration due to the acceleration and deceleration of the robot; 3) human activity recognition using contour data of the tracked human subjects extracted from depth images. Results showed that, depending on depth data can be quite useful as an observation by simplifying state space in 2D rather than 3D state space, and, a fuzzy control algorithm could decrease the vibration due to the acceleration and deceleration. Finally, the human activity recognition could be achieved with a high correct rate, by using geometric parameters extracted from contour data.",

The advantages of using an ontology-based representation of the main data structure of a DSS are many: (i) it enables the integration of heterogeneous sources of data available in the web, and to be processed by the DSS, (ii) it allows to track, and to expose in a structured form to additional services (e.g., explanation or case reuse services), all the content processed and produced by the DSS for each request, and (iii) it enables to exploit logical reasoning for some of the inference steps of the DSS decision-making process.

The problem of learning relational structure for sequence labeling can be posed as learning Markov Logic Networks (MLN) for sequence labeling, which we abbreviate as Markov Logic Chains (MLC). This objective in propositional space can be solved efficiently and optimally by a Hierarchical Kernels based approach, referred to as StructRELHKL, which we recently proposed. However, the applicability of StructRELHKL in complex first order settings is non-trivial and challenging. We present the challenges and possibilities for optimally and simultaneously learning the structure as well as parameters of MLCs (as against learning them separately and/or greedily). Here, we look into leveraging the StructRELHKL approach for optimizing the MLC learning steps to the extent possible. To this end, we categorize first order MLC features based on their complexity and show that complex features can be constructed from simpler ones. We define a self-contained class of features called absolute features ($backslashmathcalAF$), which can be conjoined to yield complex MLC features. Our approach first generates a set of relevant $backslashmathcalAF$s and then makes use of the algorithm for StructRELHKL to learn their optimal conjunctions. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by evaluating on a publicly available activity recognition dataset.",

To address this issue, we introduce a new activity modeling technique, which utilizes simple yet often ignored activity semantics. Activity semantics are highly evidential knowledge that can identify an activity more accurately in ambiguous situations. We classify semantics into three types and apply them to generic activity framework, which is a refined hierarchical composition structure of the traditional activity theory. We compare the introduced activity model with the traditional model and the hierarchical models in terms of attainable recognition certainty.

Wireless sensor networks are offering the next evolution in biometrics and healthcare monitoring applications. The present paper proposes a congestion control protocol based on the learning automata which prevents the congestion by controlling the source rate. Furthermore, a new active queue management mechanism is developed. The main objective of the proposed active queue management mechanism is to control and manage the entry of each packet to sensor nodes based on learning automata. The proposed system is able to discriminate different physiological signals and assign them different priorities. Thus, it would be possible to provide better quality of service for transmitting highly important vital signs. The simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol improves system throughput and reduces delay and packet dropping.",

The developed system utilizes background domain knowledge about the user activities and the environment in combination with probabilistic reasoning methods in order to build best possible explanation of the observed stream of sensor events. The main advantage over traditional methods, e.g. dynamic Bayesian models, lies in the ability to deploy the solution in different environments without needing to undergo a training phase. To demonstrate this, tests with recorded data sets from two ambient intelligence labs have been conducted. The results show that even using basic semantic modeling of how the user behaves and how his/her behavior is reflected in the environment, it is possible to draw conclusions about the certainty and the frequencies with which certain activities are performed.",

This paper analyses trends in patient satisfaction reporting of telemedicine applications, specifically comparing three telemedicine classes (store-and-forward, realtime consultation, telecare) and the two study stages of pilot and routine delivery. We also discuss the methods used to acquire satisfaction. This paper aims to challenge current approaches and provide recommendations on improving satisfaction evaluation of new telemedicine applications towards provision of patient-centred care. Literature searches were conducted for selected telemedicine studies which report measures of satisfaction from sources of Web of Knowledge and PubMed. Evaluations of patient satisfaction were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis reports that patient satisfaction evaluation is insufficient. However, an increased trend has been detected, which was most evident in the major growth area of telecare. Evaluations are not as actively performed in the routine delivery stage as the pilot stage. Our qualitative analysis found that measuring methods used are usually unsophisticated, poorly described, and often fails to allow patients to communicate their experience in a useful manner. Great attention must be paid to address overall deficiencies in the important area of patient satisfaction evaluation. Satisfaction evaluations are necessarily telemedicine class-specific with an emphasis on telecare applications. There is an obvious need to adopt standard methodologies for measuring satisfaction and ways of incorporating this into economic evaluation, to ensure comparability of data and applications, and not least to compel researchers to adopt an agreement on the dimensions of satisfaction to be evaluated.",

The second instruction consisted of a visualized menu tree, in which the menu path to be taken was marked. By this, mainly survey knowledge but also route information was provided. The third instruction format also used the visualized menu tree. However, in addition to the menu path which had to be taken, also functions labels were given, conveying landmark, route and survey knowledge. Further, a condition was examined in which no help was given. Dependent variables were navigation effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the step-by-step condition, the instruction type most often used in technical leaflets, had the smallest effect, especially for users with low spatial visualization abilities.

Pervasive computing enables assistive environments with extensive possibilities, especially when seizing opportunities to enhance quality of life for ageing people with dementia. However, we have to design novel interfaces to aid the engagement of targeted users towards the provided services. A natural, seamless interactive experience must be created. Our focus lies mainly on the reasoning mechanisms performing user interface plasticity, i.e. context-aware adaptation of the interaction to create a seamless user experience.",

Robots are more and more used in a social context, and in this paper we try to formulate a research agenda concerning ethical issues around social HRI in order to be prepared for future scenarios where robots may be a naturally integrated part of human society. We outline different paradigms to describe the role of social robots in communication processes with humans, and connect HRI with the topic of persuasive technology in health care, to critically reflect the potential benefits of using social robots as persuasive agents. The ability of a robotic system to conform to the demands (behaviors, understanding, roles, and tasks) that arise from the place the robot is designed to perform, affect the user and his/er sense of place attachment. Places are constantly changing, and so do interactions, thus robotic systems should continually adjust to change by modifying their behavior accordingly.",

But since evaluation of ontologies on these resource constrained devices becomes more and more necessary (e.g. for diagnostics) we developed an OWL reasoner for embedded devices.

Indeed, the first feature is an efficient solution to detect falls as the vast majority of falls ends on the ground or near the ground. However, this method can fail if the end of the fall is completely occluded behind furniture. Fortunately, these cases can be managed by using the 3D person velocity computed just before the occlusion.",

In this system, we cope with not only the users physical location but also all the situations of pervasive devices and requirements of associated users, in both sides of watching and watched sites. Moreover, social relationships between observers and a watched person are used to give an adequate privacy level to the services. To do this, we propose a pervasive watching over system uEyes. In uEyes we introduce three distinguished features for the watching, they are (S1) Device awareness, (S2) User awareness and (S3) Social awareness. To realize these features, an autonomous decision making ability and cooperative behavior are employed to each element in the system. Based on these advanced features, a live video streaming system is autonomously constructed according to the device status and the users situation, on both sides in runtime. As a result, the gentle watching-over service can be effectively provided.",

		"abstract": "Automated activity recognition systems that use probabilistic models require labeled data sets in training phase for learning the model parameters. The parameters are different for every person and every environment. Therefore, for every person or environment, training is needed to be performed from scratch. Obtaining labeled data requires much effort therefore poses challenges on the large scale deployment of activity recognition systems. Active learning can be a solution to this problem. It is a machine learning technique that allows the algorithm to choose the most informative data points to be annotated. Because the algorithm selects the most informative data points, the amount of the labeled data needed for training the model is reduced. In this study, we propose using active learning methods for activity recognition. We use three different informativeness measures for selecting the most informative data points and evaluate their performances using three real world data sets recorded in a home setting. We show through experiments that the required number of data points is reduced by 80% in House A, 73% in House B, and 66% in House C with active learning.",

		"abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a promising and fast growing area of technologies and services to assist people with special needs (e.g. elderly or disabled) in managing more independently their everyday life. AAL is founded on increasing needs for welfare technologies, as well as on significant effort from many scientific disciplines, the society, and the industry. The research has so far been primarily concentrated on elicitation of the functional aspects and on providing the technical solutions for the AAL systems and services. The problem of eliciting non-functional requirements and quality characteristics that are specific and critical for AAL, however, has been addressed to a much lesser extent. Failing to ensure the necessary system and service quality regarding critical characteristics may represent a significant obstacle to the wider acceptance of AAL in the society. There is hence a need to increase awareness of quality of AAL systems and services by providing the necessary supplement to the established state of the art. This paper reports on the process and the results from elicitation of AAL specific quality characteristics. The approach is based on established reference architectures and roadmapping material, as well as the ISO/IEC 9126 software product quality standard. The paper demonstrates how to do the elicitation in practice, and proposes the set of quality characteristics that are most important in the AAL context.",

A possible approach for multiple people is to take an existing system for single person activity recognition and extend it to the case of multiple people. One approach is Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) which provides capabilities of multiple people tracking and activity recognition based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network Model. The advantage of such systems is that the number of people can vary, while the disadvantage is that the activity recognition configuration cannot be done if only multiple people data is available for training.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents a human daily activity classification approach based on the sensory data collected from a single tri-axial accelerometer worn on waist belt. The classification algorithm was realized to distinguish 6 different activities including standing, jumping, sitting-down, walking, running and falling through three major steps: wavelet transformation, Principle Component Analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction and followed by implementing a radial basis function (RBF) kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Two trials were conducted to evaluate different aspects of the classification scheme. In the first trial, the classifier was trained and evaluated by using a dataset of 420 samples collected from seven subjects by using a k-fold cross-validation method. The parameters $sigma$ and c of the RBF kernel were optimized through automatic searching in terms of yielding the highest recognition accuracy and robustness. In the second trial, the generation capability of the classifier was also validated by using the dataset collected from six new subjects. The average classification rates of 95% and 93% are obtained in trials 1 and 2, respectively. The results in trial 2 show the system is also good at classifying activity signals of new subjects. It can be concluded that the collective effects of the usage of single accelerometer sensing, the setting of the accelerometer placement and efficient classifier would make this wearable sensing system more realistic and more comfortable to be implemented for long-term human activity monitoring and classification in ambulatory environment, therefore, more acceptable by users.",

Moreover, representation relations for cognitive states are derived, relating them to external events such as stimuli that can be monitored.

		"abstract": "Sensor-based human activity recognition aims to automatically identify human activities from a series of sensor observations, which is a crucial task for supporting wide range applications. Typically, given sufficient training examples for all activities (or activity classes), supervised learning techniques have been applied to build a classification model using sufficient training samples for differentiating various activities. However, it is often impractical to manually label large amounts of training data for each individual activities. As such, semi-supervised learning techniques sound promising alternatives as they have been designed to utilize a small training set L, enhanced by a large unlabeled set U. However, we observe that directly applying semi-supervised learning techniques may not produce accurate classification. In this paper, we have designed a novel dynamic temporalextension technique to extend L into a bigger training set, and then build a final semi-supervised learning model for more accurate classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed technique outperforms existing 7 state-of-the-art supervised learning and semi-supervised learning techniques.",

However, with mobile phone the application has to comply with peoples usage habit of it and thus capture the right moment to recognize activities, which will potentially cause great in-class variances. As a result, the model potentially becomes complex and costs much computing resources in mobile phone. This paper recognize peoples physical activities when they place the mobile phone in the pockets near the pelvic region. Experiment results show that the accuracy could reach 97.7%. To reduce the model size, evaluation of each feature attribution contribution for the accuracy is performed.

		"abstract": "Recently, wireless sensor networks have been proposed for assisted living and residential monitoring. In such networks, physiological sensors are used to monitor vital signs e.g. heartbeats, pulse rates, oxygen saturation of senior citizens. Sensor data is sent periodically via wireless links to a personal computer that analyzes the data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection scheme based on time series analysis that will allow the computer to determine whether a stream of real-time sensor data contains any abnormal heartbeats. If anomaly exists, that time series segment will be transmitted via the network to a physician so that he/she can further diagnose the problem and take appropriate actions. When tested against the heartbeat data readings stored at the MIT database, our ECG anomaly scheme is shown to have better performance than another scheme that has been recently proposed. Our scheme enjoys an accuracy rate that varies from 70-90% while the other scheme has an accuracy that varies from 40-70%.",

We illustrate the performance of this method on an audio database, which composed of 10 sounds classes.

We describe a technique named radio tomographic imaging (RTI), which produces real-time images of the change in the radio propagation field of the monitored area caused by the presence of people. Peoples locations are inferred from the estimated RTI images. We show results from a long-term deployment in a typical single floor, one bedroom apartment. In order to deal with the dynamic nature of the domestic environment, we introduce methods to make the RTI system self-calibrating. Experimental results show that the average localization error of the system is 0.23 m. Moreover, the system is capable of adapting to the changes in the indoor environment, achieving high localization accuracy over an extended period of time.",

The problem of urban congestion amplifies the issue of suburban disintegration, with the needs, uses and purposes of the city and of its inhabitants being more and more neglected. With reference to a sustainable territory transformation, the challenge of the research is double: on one hand, it aims at elaborating hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the possible scenarios of urban alternative mobility---ought to become more efficient; on the other hand, it seeks to integrate mobility systems with the project of territorial interchanges, grouping the population together into poles, linked by environmentally-friendly collective transports. The scenarios offered within the open field of urban phenomenology intend to create ideal social and environmental conditions, to optimize the way urban spaces are used and to create a mobility system able to guarantee an accessible and safe urban environment.",

The Smart Cities vision is to automate critical public services, make improvements for community interaction, and achieve significant levels of efficiency in a connected and technology-driven society, such as in traffic control. However, this has positioned Smart Cities to be a target of compromised Cyber Security, which can potentially undermine the information systems of local departments, general security, law enforcement, and transport systems. Dubai is a dynamic and emerging economy that has the potential to become a major economic center of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region owing to its strength in strategic information. The main purpose of this paper is to explore, evaluate, and discuss components of overall strategic security, innovation, management, and the development of Dubai in terms of Cyber Security. This study also showcases conducted survey results based on the Smart City Cyber Security program. Furthermore, it demonstrates the current and future challenges faced by Smart Cities from cyber-threats, including the development of strategic security plans to defend against sophisticated cyberattacks, and encourages citizens to take responsibility and implement awareness of how to proactively counter cyberattacks on Smart Cities. However, it is imperative to evaluate the strategies that are required to prepare Dubais Electronic Security Center to align with Dubai Vision 2021 in order for Dubai to be one of the securest Smart Cities in terms of Cyber Security around the globe. This research aims to argue that to develop Dubais Electronic Security Center, strategies should be a top priority for Dubai to ensure the security of the Smart City and to diminish cybercrime in Dubai.",

		"abstract": "Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies have the capacity to provide a safe environment for elderly people and to monitor and analyse gathered data which have been proven to be valuable in detecting activities that underpin health decline. Although there is a growing interest for these technologies, older people face some difficulties interacting with the technology. In an AAL environment, the interaction problem due to changes in perceptual and motor skill capabilities that often accompany the aging process in elderly people is further complicated as the immense quantity of sensors, with varying user interface and user interaction, makes full interoperability difficult. As elderly people navigate through this environment, they should be able to discover, configure, and directly interact with a myriad smart objects and digital information delivered to them. To increase the uptake of these technologies, there is a need for an intuitive interaction technique that considers elderly peoples personal profile and presents contextual information when needed. In this paper, we present an interaction design research which aims to explore opportunities and challenges inherent to the development of an Assistive Technology (AT) for elderly people. The proposed AT, which is a combination of Mixed Reality (MR) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, aims to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) and to maintain the self-independence of people aged 65 or above. The intended users are elderly people, their family, their closest friends, and their healthcare network. The main contribution of this project is to provide a set of interaction design principles for combining MR and IoT as an AT. This is achieved by a carefully planned participatory design approach. The benefits and drawbacks of each phase are discussed transparently to inform current practices which are still mostly technology driven.",

This has increased the efforts to improve citizens quality of life in urban areas by offering smarter and more efficient IT-based services in different domains such as health-care and transportation. Smart phones are key devices that provide a way for people to interact with the smart city services through their mobile applications (Apps). As the population is ageing and many services are now offered through mobile Apps, it is necessary to design accessible mobile interfaces that consider senior citizens needs. These needs are related to cognitive, perceptual, and psycho-motor changes that occur while ageing, which affect the way older people interact with a smart phone. Although a comprehensive set of design guidelines are suggested, there is no evaluation on how and to what extent they are considered during the mobile App design process. This paper evaluates the implementation of these guidelines in several industry-built Apps, which are either targeted at older people or critical city services Apps that may benefit older people, but are targeted at a broader audience.",

Mobility in cities, the fact that moving in a vehicle (fuel, electric, shared, autonomous), public transport or other means is becoming a common, difficult and complex congestion problem for cities, has negative economic consequences. This enormous pressure for efficiency and the search for solutions are making significant inroads into the incorporation of ICT in smart cities and subsequent large-scale digitization to resolve this issue and other setbacks.

This advanced technology attempts to bridge the gap between the information world and the physical world. Recent studies investigate efficient, flexible, scalable and reliable IoT systems that not only control things and devices on behalf of humans but adaptable to humans preferences. However, the autonomous control of the IoT in a smart home or healthcare environment subjects to many factors such as human health, time and date. For example, peoples needs and behaviours during workdays differ from weekends or a young person needs and behaviours differs from an elderly person. Hence, the practical setting of a smart home entails flexible management to the autonomous control of IoT systems. This paper proposes an architecture of Adjustable-Autonomous Multi-agent IoT (AAMA-IoT) system to resolve a number of the IoT management of control and application interface challenges. The AAMA-IoT is applied in an elderly smart home simulation in which autonomous agents control passive things such as a chair or door and active things such as a television or an air conditioner. The test results show that the AAMA-IoT system controls 14 things with average activities recognition accuracy of 96.97%.",

To do so, we build predictive models to learn the relationship between depression level changes and behaviors using historical data. We also deploy the system for a group of elderly, in their homes, and run the experiments for more than one year.

		"abstract": "To realize the Internet-based sociotechnical systems, it is necessary to build a comprehensive and effective infrastructure to support the interaction between various cloud services on the Internet and the physical world in which we live. For example, the information produced by the sensors is usually aggregated, processed and analyzed by services in the cloud, which can be used by various stakeholders for decision-making in many different application fields. Therefore, we need to consider integrating the Internet of Services (IoS), which enables the flexible sharing and composition of cloud services on the Internet, with the Internet of Things (IoT), which represents the constellation of things equipped with various sensors and actuators. The integration of IoS and IoT often involves multiple parties and so must deal with complex issues such as interaction, dynamics, scalability and decision making, all of which can be studied from a multiagent perspective. In this paper, we start by discussing the necessities and challenges for integrating IoS and IoT. Then, we propose an integrated architecture and examine it from two multiagent perspectives. One is to regard the integrated architecture of IoS and IoT as a multiagent-based architecture considering various patterns of service composition and interaction. The other is to apply multiagent methodologies when designing sociotechnical systems for various application domains based on the integrated IoS/IoT architecture. Moreover, we use the example application of designing multilingual environments to discuss the above two perspectives with possible future research directions.",

Consequently, the Chinese government proposed the new concept of smart society in 2017 as the next generation of smart city initiative, with the aim of enhancing living standard of residents in not just urban but also rural areas. In this paper, we elaborate the concept and vision of smart society, and present and discuss a variety of issues concerning the transformation from smart city to smart society in China, including cross-departmental coordination, public awareness and participation, and information security and privacy.

Although Internet of things (IoT) is becoming the essential aspect of every persons life and making the life comfortable, on the other side there are some challenges and problems which are also found in the Internet world. These issues make the smart world more unsafe and challenging like privacy issue, security, reliability, scalability, and interoperability. In these days, problem of incompatibility of devices is at high risk that makes things more expensive. So there is a need to tackle the interoperability problem. This paper proposed a model-driven approach (MDA) for making devices compatible. In the thesis, authors worked on platform independent model (PIM) and computation independent model.

		"abstract": "Indoor environment quality (IEQ) has a significant impact on health and in all human activities. On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterised by numerous pollution sources that can lead to relevant unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, experimental testing requires the supervision of several indoor parameters, such as the case of thermography experiments. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies, there is a great potential to create automatic solutions for IEQ supervision. In fact, due to people spend about 90% of our lives indoors, it is crucial to monitor the IEQ in real-time to detect unhealthy conditions to quickly take interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health. Buildings are responsible for about 40% of the global energy consumption, and over 30% of the CO2 emissions; also a considerable proportion of this energy is used for thermal comfort. This paper aims to present a solution for real-time supervision of laboratory environmental conditions based on IoT architecture named iLabM. The solution is composed by a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and smartphone compatibility for data consulting. The iLabM provides temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and qualitative air quality data supervision in real-time. The smartphone application can be used to access the collected data in real time but also provides the history of the IEQ data. The results obtained are promising, representing a significant contribution to IEQ monitoring systems based on IoT.",

We first address suitable programming abstractions for the software agents that would provide IoTs inter-operability, enabling different users, devices and platforms to effectively communicate and coordinate with each other. We then review some desiderata for the Next-Generation (NG) IoT middleware design. To address cyber-security for IoT holistically, we outline some elements of computational intelligence that would enable the self-healing and self-recovery capabilities of the NG IoT. We argue that the design of NG cyber-defense, self-healing and self-recovering mechanisms could greatly benefit from exploring paradigms from biology -- in particular, from the immune systems of living organisms. If such highly adaptable self-healing capabilities were built into the NG IoT, future cyber-attacks would cause much less disruption to the infrastructure and the end-users than what was the case with some recent cyber-attacks on the present-day IoT.",

		"abstract": "The safety of people and spaces is of paramount importance for societies. With time, the implementation of safety measures is rapidly changing from a need to a priority. Video surveillance systems play a key role in the surveillance of crucial and critical areas as these systems help the authorities keep places safer. With the rapid growth of technology and the implementation of the smart city concept, it is becoming possible to develop and deploy wide area surveillance systems. The ease with which these systems can be installed in private and public spaces (e.g., homes, streets and parks) allow for the creation of ubiquitous monitored environments. Rapid intervention responses to any abnormal situation or the use of recorded video as evidence are some advantages of the use of this type of surveillance systems. Although ubiquitous video surveillance systems are relevant for present modern societies, their cost is still high. To solve or, at least to mitigate this problem, a low-cost smart surveillance system was developed, which is presented and described in this paper. The developed surveillance system, based on available low-cost technology, can help keep critical spaces under surveillance 24/7. The proposed solution was found to have a minimal cost, a low bandwidth, and to be scalable and adaptable to every clients needs. Thus, the solution can be used by anybody (private and public) and applied in different contexts (e.g., residential, industrial). The system can provide still images, captured from surveillance video cameras, real time video and real time video processing, which can be used for motion detection. When this happens, the user is warned via an e-mail containing the identification of the respective surveillance camera. Only the relevant video events are sent, recorded and maintained in the cloud platform system, consequently reducing the amount of storage space required to maintain all the historical video events. The results of the tests carried out show that it is possible to stream a video from the surveillance cameras with an insignificant delay and that motion detection can be attained through real time video processing. The system presented potentiates a low-cost solution for a smart city in the surveillance field.",

Since context in healthcare has its unique characteristics, it is necessary to define an appropriate context aware framework for healthcare IoT applications. We identify this context as perceived in healthcare applications and describe the context aware procedures. We also present an architecture that connects the sensors that measure biometric data with the sensory networks of the environment and the various IoT middleware that reside in the geographical area.

When this fact is combined with the increase in life longevity due to medical and social advances it alters the demographic balance in relation to age. Hence, the number of people aged 65 and over is constantly increasing. The potential of Smart Technologies and IoT-based devices to improve health has increased rapidly in the last few years and users are now in a position to contribute to the development of the interaction process and need to be properly trained on benefits of using new technologies. IFTTT (If This Then That), Blockly, and other similar tools provide a new perspective on web-based services, and represent an innovative and inclusive instrument to manage small automated tasks between Internet-connected devices by using a simplified interaction approach. The main research question of this work is: how could senior users benefit and adopt smart devices in a proficient way and how can emerging technologies such as automation services enhance safety, health and well-being for people with different abilities? The research method is based on a participatory, Inclusive Design approach, developed through interviews and focus groups, among a restricted number of people of different age and gender, design and usability tests in the further stage. The aim of the work is to make existing technologies more accepted, usable and inclusive for as many people as possible. This goal will be achieved by analysis and by creating a set of interactive and easy to use information and tools for automating different processes, to improve the performance in Activities of Daily Living and increase the connection and socialization between citizens, their family and friends. Applets for Seniors could be seen as a different approach to enable users with different abilities in interacting in a friendly way with new technologies and could be also used as a User Experience facilitator for people who are not familiar with smart devices.",

One of the areas that are leading up to IoT is Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp). There are thus solutions such as frameworks, middlewares, and other development artifacts that come from the UbiComp community and can be used for IoT applications. On the other hand, the interaction evaluation of the applications can be more complex in IoT than in UbiComp systems, once we have two different perspectives: Human-Thing and Thing-Thing interactions. In this paper, based on the literature, our experience in these two domains, and case studies with Ubicomp and IoT applications, we discuss how we can benefit from the UbiComp move towards IoT, focusing on the main differences and similarities related to interaction evaluation. These differences open a set of questions that are also presented and discussed in this paper.",

This work proposes a coupling model, based on standards, technologies, and methodologies, able to make easy and effective the distribution, access, and use of data between services providers and citizens. The system architecture has been designed and developed by using the OSGi technology exploiting a support supplied by Docker, a platform able to ensure greater freedom in the modularization of software platforms oriented to micro-services. Furthermore, for higher levels, an approach based on the OneM2M standard has been adopted in order to obtain a middle layer useful to large-scale coordination of aspects related to the gathering, discovery, security and distribution of data and services. An use case has been defined and summarized in order to clearly show potential benefits of the proposed system for all stakeholders.",

However, elders privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication or other reasons. To demonstrate how serious this issue is, we introduce in this paper a Privacy Mining Approach (PMA) to mine privacy from smart homes by conducting a series of deductions and analyses on sensor datasets generated by smart homes.

		"abstract": "The increase in life expectancy and the consequent aging of the general population pose, nowadays, major challenges to modern societies. Most elderly people have the usual problems related to old age, like health chronic problems and sensory and cognitive impairments. Besides that, in todays modern societies, where families have less and less time to look after for their old relatives, the isolation of the elderly is a real concern and a very current problem, which is enhanced if the elders live alone. To solve or, at least, mitigate that problem, it was developed a smart home for elders that is presented and described in this paper. The developed assistive home system, which is based on available technology, can ensure the quality of life, safety and well-being of all older adults that want or desire to live in the comfort of their home, near to their friends and in their neighborhood, instead of living in elder care centers. The proposed solution can record and analyze the elders daily routines in order to alert (e.g., e-mails or text messages) the family members and/or social agents (e.g., doctors and caregivers) whenever an unusual situation occurs or when the elder is in danger, provide real-time audio and video when necessary and some comfort features, such as, automatic lighting and temperature control. The relevant events are recorded and maintained in a cloud database, which can be accessed through a dedicated website or by an Internet of Things (IoT) Application Programming Interface (API). Although this type of solution/service is focused in the elderly population, anybody can use it. The developed solution provides comfort and safety to elders and, at the same time, an easier way of monitoring all important events.",

The project is annually organized by municipality and primary schools to improve computer literacy in the senior attendees. Researchers applied quantitative and qualitative methods. Results relating to the respondents history in gaining computer skills showed that self-education and assistance from family members represent the main role in this field, nearly one third of attendees marked attendance of computer courses. As for skills, which the elderly would like to gain or practice, work with photography and files dominated. Most attendees were familiar with E-mail; they found learning to use Skype communication application more beneficial. The aim of the paper is to identify computer skills that the seniors attending the free courses would like have or develop in order to be able to participate partially or fully in Smart City without feeling aside. Research results were presented at the meeting of the directors and municipality representatives and are being incorporated into a next phase of the project with an updated design and content of the courses in a new learning environment.",

The abundance of raw data necessitates the use of data analytics in order to extract useful patterns for decision making. Current architectures for big data analytics in the IoT domain address the large volume and velocity of the produced data. However, they do not address the semantic heterogeneity in the data models used by diverse IoT platforms, which emerges when large-scale deployments, spanning across multiple deployment sites, are considered. This paper proposes an architecture for big data analytics in the context of large-scale IoT systems consisting of multiple IoT platforms. A Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) handles the interoperability among the data models of the individual platforms, using semantic mappings between them and a unified ontology. Data queries to the SIL and result collection is handled by a cloud-based data management layer, namely the Data Lake, along with storage of metadata needed by data analytics methods. Based on this infrastructure, web-based data analytics and visual analytics methods are used to analyze the collected data, while being agnostic of platform-specific details. The proposed architecture is developed in the context of healthcare provision for older people, although it can be applied to any IoT domain.",

There are numerous findings regarding the effects of air pollution, for instance air pollutants playing a notorious role in inducing asthma and in formation of acid rain. Apart from regular activities done by government like creating acts, setting standards and regular inspection in industries to provide people with pollution free environment, various mobile apps like Air Quality India, SAFAR Air have been developed and disseminated to create environmental awareness. But even then, air pollution persists due to gases from vehicles on roads, Choloro Fluro Carbon from home appliances, Carbon Monoxide from incomplete combustion of fuels or gas, particulate matters from cigarette smoking, cooking etc. Individuals are affected by these air pollutants which are predominant in the air they breathe in. It is necessary to educate people on how to ameliorate the effects of air pollutants and control air pollution. In this paper, we have presented a framework that utilizes data from social networks and supervised machine learning algorithm, which will facilitate in taking an initial step towards a smart environment in smart cities. A part of our proposed application was tested with a group of people. These experiments showed better accuracy in classifying people according to the place where they spend most of their time in a day, and also received good responses from the people.",

Thus, intelligent solutions that rely on the Internet of Things have been proposed in the literature, with the final goal to give remote support to elderly people at their home. Those solutions aim at monitoring activities and behaviors, and automatically send alarms in case of anomalies, putting in contact the end-user with her/his GP or alerting the emergency center or familiars, according to the specific needs. However, although the great deal of worldwide researches in the area of the Internet of Things and its early applications to healthcare and teleassistance, the technologies to apply it in real-world with the necessary dependability levels are far from being assessed.

Home monitoring is particularly important for caregivers and relatives, who are in charge of these persons in potentially risky environments (e.g., the kitchen, the bathroom, the stairs, go out alone to the street, etc.), while they perform their household activities. On the other hand, the paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) allows the interconnection of everyday objects to implement sophisticate, yet simple-to-use, computer systems.

Several studies have indicated the need for strategies to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. A promising trend in healthcare is to move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patients home (home-centric). Moreover, recent advances in microelectronics, wireless, sensing and information have boosted the advent of a revolutionary model involving systems and communication technology, enabling smarter ways to make things happen. This new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has a broad applicability in several areas, including healthcare. The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of this technology-based healthcare approach, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve the wellness of the patients, as well as a better application of government financial resources. Based on this context, this paper aims to describe a review to comprehend the current state and future trends for healthcare applications based on IoT infrastructure, and also to find areas for further investigations.",

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an approach for optimizing the usage of situation recognition algorithms in Internet of Things domains. The key idea of our approach is to select important data, based on situation recognition purposes, and to execute the situation recognition algorithms after all relevant data have been collected. The main advantage of our approach is that situation recognition algorithms will not be executed each time new data is received, thus allowing the reduction of the situation recognition algorithms execution frequency and saving computational resources.",

		"abstract": "Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) computing paradigm have made it a popular solution covering many areas such as smart cities, connected vehicles, smart farming etc. to provide major economic benefits, reduced resource consumption, smarter environments and increased sharing of resources among other advantages. However, the security issues arising from the scale of connectivity and heterogeneity of resources in IoT make it a hot target for attackers, where centralized security solutions fall short. The vulnerabilities in providing proper device authentication and data integrity in IoT networks have been shown to introduce devastating effects. This calls for designing a data security architecture for IoT, which can accurately authenticate devices by anyone in the network in a decentralized manner and prevent unauthorized modification of the stored data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach for IoT systems that introduces transparency and tamper-resistance into data storage and retrieval in IoT networks. Evaluation of a developed prototype demonstrates that the proposed solution is promising to present a unified framework for IoT data security.",

The first layer implements a comparison to preserve the system integrated. In the second layer, original values are stored in offline database storage to disable any access caused by threats; to preserve it available. The third one frequently generates an authenticated QR tag using 1-session private key to prevent both information leakage and an unauthorized access if the key was deduced; to keep it confidential.

Many countries face the challenge of supporting an aging population despite increasing healthcare costs, and an insufficient number of caregivers. Emerging technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), can help. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are a good indicator of healthy aging and provide a baseline for detecting an elders changes in physical and cognitive state. Monitoring and accurately classifying elders activities helps prevent and mitigate some common risks faced by elders when they age-in-place. In our study, we partnered with a senior care provider to add sensors to five apartments in an independent living facility and provided the requisite 24/7 monitoring. Ambient sensors were deployed in each of the apartments and collected high-density IoT sensor data for six months for each of the study participants, who were all over the age of 70. While we successfully created a model to classify ADLs through the recognition and observation of patterns based on high-density ambient sensor placement, sensor data and semantics, and characteristics of activities, we discovered challenges in capturing every ADL for each participant. Often, the ADLs captured for each participant offered unique and personalized indicators of healthy aging. This paper explores the challenges of deploying consumer-grade, IoT, sensors, and the application of AI technology to learn and model elders ADLs. We also share results of our exploration to classify ADLs in the data using manual crowd-sourcing, rule-based reasoning and machine learned analytics.",

In this study a Smart Home in a Box (SHIB) solution has been developed to support Ambient Assistive Living (AAL). This paper presents a solution for an interface to interact and be notified by the SHIB platform. A usability evaluation of the developed solution is also presented in the paper. This evaluation asked 8 people consisting of management staff and a Family and Relatives group from a care home, to determine how older people would feel about a solution like this. Overall the participants of the usability evaluation felt the developed solution would benefit older people living at home.",

In this paper, we focus on two of the numerous dimensions of IoT systems with which the users interact; (1) the IoT user interface and (2) the IoT ecosystem. Based on literature, we develop a model that identifies how data is presented to users and how users interact with the system, and the level at which systems interconnect with, and collects data from, multiple systems. Companies can use the model to assess their systems in order to identify the current state of their systems and to identify the desired state. Moreover, the model can be used to better understand the steps necessary for transforming from one dimension to another in order to develop more advanced IoT systems.",

The results of the statistics show that the share of seniors in the Czech Republic has an increasing trend. The utilization of social networks by elderly people has in the Czech Republic also increasing trend except for the second quarter of the 2015 year when a slight decrease was recorded. In comparison with other countries from Visegrad group and the EU 28 the Czech Republic reached lower results in the utilization of social networks. In two evaluated criteria from three the Czech Republic was comparable to Poland. The age groups show that with increasing age there is a declining trend for the use of social networks. 10.1% of the population from 55 to 64 years and 3.3% of the population over 65 use social networks in the second quarter of 2015.

So far, there is no much study to differentiate varieties of function demands of smart home. In addition, their preference for requirements of smart home is different as different groups are different in consumption psychology and consumption behavior. For example, the consumption behavior of middle-aged group is rather conservative and youth group is active in thinking and likes to buy some new products and try new life.

In this paper, we assessed challenges in the adoption of IoT in developing countries in agriculture. We propose a cost effective, energy efficient, secure, reliable and heterogeneous (independent of the IoT protocol) three layer architecture for IoT driven agriculture. The first layer consists of IoT devices and it is made up of IoT driven agriculture systems such as smart poultry, smart irrigation, theft detection, pest detection, crop monitoring, food preservation, and food supply chain systems. The IoT devices are connected to the gateways by low power LoRaWAN network. The gateways and local processing servers co-located with the gateways create the second layer. The cloud layer is the third layer, which exploits the open source FIWARE platform to provide a set of public and free-to-use API specifications that come along with open source reference implementations.",

In view of ageing populations worldwide, there is significant interest among the healthcare sector and researchers to improve medication adherence rates for seniors.

In this paper, we present our work on technology-enabled medication adherence for 24 community-dwelling seniors over a period of more than 2 years. We leverage Internet of Things (IoT) devices to track inferred medication consumption in the seniors homes, and provide quasi real-time alerts to community caregivers, who can then intervene in a timely manner. Our study suggests that seniors generally do not consume medication on a regular basis (in both the frequency and time domains). However, technology-based approaches that allow for real-time tracking and appropriate interventions by caregivers can be effective in improving the medication adherence of these seniors.",

In this paper, we describe a general Back-End solution to store heterogeneous data collected from different sources. We used the stack named MEAN to program web services, and JSON as the data model to interchange information. On this study, we show the advantage of using JSON and a NoSQL database to integrate different solutions developed in projects that involve the Internet of Things philosophy.",

		"abstract": "In times of the demographic change and the increasing need of novel concepts to meet the requirements of older adults care in the near future, health care robots could be a potent solution to meet shortcomings in the health care sector. Even though the potential of robotic home care assistance is promising, the question if older persons would accept a robotic assistance at home is still underexplored. Adopting a three-step procedure, older adults perceptions towards home care robots are empirically explored. In a first step, focus groups were accomplished to understand older persons perceptions on benefits and barriers. Second, a survey study was applied to determine acceptance criteria, the perceived usefulness and the extent and types of concerns toward a domestic robot in homecare. Finally, in a further survey study, specific care situations in the home care settings had to be evaluated in a third study, thereby comparing preferences for a human care persons vs. a robotic care assistant. Outcomes reveal both, age-sensitive as well as age-insensitive findings. While overall a positive attitude towards home care robots was found, serious concerns in terms of fear of loss of control and connection to family members are prevailing. Outcomes contribute to an understanding of social factors in the development and implementation of accepted home care solutions and might be helpful to develop age-sensitive information and communication concepts.",

		"abstract": "The increasing availability of low-cost smart devices is bringing them to be used more and more in the smart home. However, the development of a smart home environment requires to take into account several aspects. First of all, designers must consider the end user (namely the person that actually uses the smart home), and not only the technology, at the center of any intervention. Another important aspect is the interaction between the smart home and the appliances that are already deployed in the same smart environment. Moreover, most of smart home solutions are static and do not allow end users to customize them according to their real needs and preferences. Finally, not all end users may possess the necessary knowledge and skills to customize a smart home, but someone else, such as an adult child or a caregiver, may be called on to carry out this task for them. In this paper, we analyze all these aspects that can influence the development and evolution of a smart home. We then propose a model supporting developers and software engineers to deploy and evaluate a smart home solution that adopts end-user development techniques. It is based on the International Classification of Functioning scale, which is used to characterize the person that is mainly going to live in the smart home and define a solution suitable to his/her needs.",

		"abstract": "The idea of connecting physical things and cyber components to enable new and richer interactions is a key component in any smart space concept. One of the central challenges in these new smart spaces is the access control of data, services and things. In recent years, Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) like Blockchain Technology (BCT), emerged as the most promising solution for decentralized access management. Using capability-based access control, access to data/services/things is achieved by transferring tokens between the accounts of a distributed ledger. Managing how the access tokens are transferred is, of course, a major challenge. Within the IoT space, smart contracts are at the center of most of the proposals for DLT/BCT networks targeting access control. The main problem in using smart contracts as a means for checking if and what access token can be transferred from one account to another is their immutability and accessibility. Smart contracts and chain code are by design meant to be immutable since they represent a binding contract between parties. In addition, they need to be accessible since they are to be executed on many nodes. This allows an attacker to study them and design the attack in a manner that passes the rules of the smart contract/chain code. This paper focuses on the use of metadata as a more effective means to prevent attackers from gaining access to data/services/things in a smart living space.",

These representations should also have the ability to adapt over time to the changing state of the world. That is why we propose IoT-O, a core-domain modular IoT ontology proposing a vocabulary to describe connected devices and their relation with their environment. First, existing IoT ontologies are described and compared to requirements an IoT ontology should be compliant with. Then, after a detailed description of its modules, IoT-O is instantiated in a home automation use case to illustrate how it supports the description of evolving systems.",

So, for controlling this wastage of electricity in hostels, we have tried here to develop this system that helps in monitoring and managing the electrical power requirement. In this system, IR sensors sensed the presence of students in the room with the help of counter. When it counts one, it means students enters the room, this counter increases and so on. When the student leaves the room, it decreases the count and when it reaches up to zero, this indicates that no one is present in the room. At this time, after few seconds, the switches will automatically turn OFF, if it is ON, and this information will be sent to the server/cloud where the authorized person can see or watch all the activities in the room. Here, we need only Internet for watching the online process. This will be in the form of notification where it will show the room number, OFF time. The other feature of this system is, when such notifications will be seen on the screen, one SMS will be sent to the student about Rs. 100/- penalty or punishment. Internet of Things plays a vital role in this system. This promotes students to become responsible about careful utilization of electricity.",

However, can the cities be labelled as smart just by improvising ICTs or there might be other parameters involved in making a city truly smart? The paper henceforth explores such possibilities of making a city smart by taking case studies of known cities/neighbourhoods who have optimised these standards for success. Peoples participation in using these technologies and the user experience is one of the important consideration so that they are ready to experience a livable smart and organised city. Smart governance, smart planning, smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment and smart living are also the main highlights of the paper on which the case studies are based to analyse smart cities and provide important basis to emphasise if the proposed 100 smart cites in India can really rise up to the level of smart city parameters and tell a success story.Is it only the ICTs that are responsible for making a city smart or a holistic approach is required?Are we smart enough to embrace a smart city?",

By implementing asynchronous processing, the system can increase the successful HTTP connection up to 50% for 100 users testing scenario compared to the benchmark system. The increase of successful connections improves the analytics accuracy to 98.41%.",

As an emerging novel technical paradigm, cloud computing is becoming an efficient mechanism that has been broadly implemented in multiple fields with using Internet-enabled devices. Telehealth system is one of the crucial domains in applications of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), which is also considered an important component in smart city. However, Personalized Cloud-based Telehealth (PCTH) is still facing a great challenge due to restrictions deriving from various perspectives, such as cloud resource allocations and real-time information transfers. This paper concentrates on the issue of optimizing the performance of the resource allocation for achieving smart tele-health with obtaining and analyzing real-time data within the dynamic application environment in cloud computing. The dynamic data environment is mainly associated with social connections generated by physicians or health organizations. Along with this focus, we propose a novel approach, entitled Smart Cloud-based Telehealth Cyber Physical Social Systems (SCT-CPSS), to enable mobile CPSS to offer users a real-time health information service based on the social networking behaviors and inputs. Main algorithms used in this proposed mechanism include Real-Time Matching with Dynamic Programming Algorithm (RTM-DPA) and Monte Carlo-based Real-Time Analysis Algorithm (MC-RTAA). Our experiment examination has evaluated the performance of the proposed paradigm.",

A way to accomplish this goal is to make such systems aware and knowledgeable about user interactions in the context of the given environment. In the context of smart homes, the ability of such intelligent systems to understand and analyze human behavior in the context of Activities of Daily Living is very essential. Modern day software-based solutions for development of such intelligent systems, should not only be able to sense human movements through Internet of Things based technologies but they should also be able to analyze these components of user interactions in a manner that facilitates optimal utilization of system resources, increases software productivity, improves system interoperability, reduces development and maintenance costs and allows both internal and external reusability of the solutions. Therefore, this paper discusses a study on the Complex Activity Recognition Algorithm [1] and proposes a systematic approach to improve this algorithm for better performance and system optimization. The improved version of this algorithm has been tested on several activities and the results obtained uphold the relevance for implementation of the same in different real-time environments.",

The indoor analytics client analyzes high density regions rendered from locations in real senior homes facilitated by IoT technology consisting of events describing the seniors position. These are collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client taking into account the available processing resources and configuring itself to deliver the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained by analyzing a whole weeks data in two seniors homes.

The research studies reflect that these needs are mainly used to discuss ideas of, design approaches for, the information visualization from ten aspects in the visceral level, behavioral level and reflective level. Results show that there is still a big gap existing in enabling older people and their informal caregivers to better understand smart home monitoring information.

In a multi-residential environment, these tags can also be used as unique identifiers to help distinguish individuals. However, the extra burdens of remembering and wearing sensor tags all day along restrict them to be widely accepted by senior communities, let alone by people with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we propose a novel indoor tracking technique for smart homes with multiple residents, through relying only on non-wearable, environmentally deployed sensors such as passive infrared motion sensors. We design a multi-tracker system that uses multiple, independent probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes and hidden Markov model, to track different residents movements separately. We evaluate our tracking technique on real sensor data acquired from a dual-occupancy smart home in our clinical trials. The experiment results, through comparing with location details acquired by wearable tags, demonstrate that our proposed technique is a simple yet feasible solution to tracking multi-residents indoor movements.",

Currently, the Fog is not implemented to the extent that we can submit application requirements to a Fog provider, select returned resources and deploy an application on them. A widely adopted workaround is to deploy Cloud applications that exploit the functionality of IoT and Fog devices. Although Clouds provide virtually unlimited computation power, they could present a bottleneck and unnecessary communication overhead when a huge number of devices needs to be controlled, read or written to. Therefore, it is reasonable to formulate use cases that will exploit the Edge and Fog functionality and define a set of basic requirements for Fog providers.",

		"abstract": "With the implementation of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), comes the opportunity to gain valuable insights into an individuals daily habits, patterns and routines. A vital part of the AMI is the smart meter. It enables the monitoring of a consumers electricity usage with a high degree of accuracy. Each device reports and records a consumers energy usage readings at regular intervals. This facilitates the identification of emerging abnormal behaviours and trends, which can provide operative monitoring for people living alone with various health conditions. Through profiling, the detection of sudden changes in behaviour is made possible, based on the daily activities a patient is expected to undertake during a 24-h period. As such, this paper presents the development of a system which detects accurately the granular differences in energy usage which are the result of a change in an individuals health state. Such a process provides accurate monitoring for people living with self-limiting conditions and enables an early intervention practice (EIP) when a patients condition is deteriorating. The results in this paper focus on one particular behavioural trend, the detection of sleep disturbances; which is related to various illnesses, such as depression and Alzheimers. The results demonstrate that it is possible to detect sleep pattern changes to an accuracy of 95.96 % with 0.943 for sensitivity, 0.975 for specificity and an overall error of 0.040 when using the VPC Neural Network classifier. This type of behavioral detection can be used to provide a partial assessment of a patients wellbeing.",

In fact, the practicability for vulnerable city users, such as children, acquires an intrinsic meaning of inclusion and equality, as a necessary condition to be considered and planned in a smart city. Over the years the city is based on the logic of separation and specialization of spaces and functions, so as to further differentiate the different social categories (adults, children, elderly and disabled people). In particular, children play and learn through urban space, developing and consolidating skills and competences. Children use urban space, expressing intents, idiorhythms and, therefore, specific needs. This paper proposes a phenomenological study, developed in the form of a laboratory of Cagliaris explorations, aimed at identifying the spatial, morphological and functional characters and elements of urban materials that determine childrens perception and experience of places. The results of this research are a starting point for further studies aimed at integrating, with the parameters identified, the variables already considered in the existing tool for the measurement of the walkability of urban spaces.",

The handrail-shaped sensor detects changes in mobility using information on movement velocity and the degree of dependence on the handrail. To evaluate the effectiveness of the sensor, we first assessed the accuracy of estimating the position of the load applied to the handrail in our laboratory. We then field-tested the handrail sensor in the home of an 88-year-old woman.

It is in this manner conceivable to put the warmers on reserve when the occupants are missing or to naturally adjust the utilization of the electrical assets as per the necessities of the inhabitants with the end goal to lessen the squandering of the vitality assets. Whats more, another fundamental objective of the use of data innovation to families is the security of people.

		"abstract": "The elderly population is steadily increasing in most countries due to a decline in birth and mortality rate. The population of independently living senior citizens has also become significant. This has led to an active research focus in geriatric wellness. Apart from the usual physical and cognitive decline that proceeds with age, there are much softer aspects like dignity and ability to live independently (age-in-place). If we monitor the subject all the time by instrumenting them heavily, technology can possibly predict and prevent many abnormal situations. However, this curbs the idea of independent living. Hence, while instrumenting and monitoring is an important paradigm in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), the need for the underlying technology to be non-intrusive or as natural as possible is also pressing. For example, passive infrared (PIR) sensors are quite effective and ubiquitous in detecting presence and movement. In this paper we investigate the opportunities in this sliding balance of intrusiveness versus wellness. We explore ubiquitous and pervasive monitoring to make useful inferences in the subjects activities of daily living (ADL). To this end, we evaluate different type of commercially available sensors such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect$$^backslashmathrmTM$$TM, video cameras and smart watches, which will augment the PIR sensors at home. Each sensor will allow the elderly to be monitored for specific wellness parameters. We propose a generic framework with algorithms developed in-house, highlighting the use of the Kinect for computing fall-risk through single limb stand (SLS) and postural stability, smart watches to detect multiple activities in an energy efficient manner using in-built sensors, and, finally, computer-vision based methods using video cameras to detect the liveliness of human beings by computing the micro motions of the body during sleep. These findings can be used for both early risk assessment and cognitive training of an individual. Our framework is also extensible to allow the integration of various sensors and algorithms in addition to being customizable for the context in question. A key challenge in building such a generic wellness care framework to support multiple sensor measurements, is handling the trade-off between cost, intrusiveness, and precision.",

Most of them prefer living in their houses than in a community center, even if they live alone or isolated from their family; at home, their normal routine activities and comfort makes them feel well. In this paper, an Active and Assisted Living (AAL) solution to detect irregular situations in everyday life of the elderly living alone is presented. By using low-cost sensors in an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture we aim to gather data in specific areas of an elderlys house in order to give the system enough input to detect abnormal behavior. These sensors are non-intrusive to the elderly, do not disturb them, and do not force them to wear a device at all times. These sensors can also send information to edge computing devices that analyze the data in real time using machine learning algorithms and alert family or caretakers when an unusual situation arises. The proposed solution provides a system that monitors the main activities performed by the elderly and creates patterns based on that activity to achieve its results and is scalable in terms of sensors and data input.",

Currently the ability to supply the industry with engineering graduates and staff that have an up-to-date and relevant competences might be considered as a challenge for the society. In this paper an education approach is presented where academia - industry - research institutes cooperate around the development and implementation of master level courses. The methods applied to reach the educational goals, concerning expert competence within remote diagnostics, have been on site and remote lectures given by engineering, medical and metrology experts. The pedagogical approach utilized has been flipped classroom. The main results show that academic courses developed in cooperation with industry requires flexibility, time and effort from the involved partners. The evaluation interviews indicate that student are satisfied with the courses and pedagogical approach but suggests more reconciliation meetings for course development. Labs early in the course was considered good, and division of labs at the system and the component level. However further long-term studies of evaluation of impact is necessary.",

		"abstract": "The Trigger-Action programming paradigm has been widely adopted in the last few years, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain because it allows end users without programming experience to describe how their applications should react to the many events that can occur in such very dynamic contexts. Several end user development tools exist, in both the research and industrial fields, which aim to support the increasing need to specify such rules. Thus, it becomes important for application developers and domain experts to enrich such environments with functionalities able to monitor how users actually interact with such rule editors, and show useful information to analyse the end user activity. In this paper, we present a visual tool for monitoring and analysing how users interact with a trigger-action rule editor. The goal is to provide a tool useful to better understand what end users personalization needs are, how they are expressed, how users actually specify rules, and whether users encounter any issues in interacting with the personalization features offered by the editors. The proposed solution supports the analysis through a dashboard and a set of timelines describing the actual use of the personalization tool, with the possibility to select specific events of interest. It moreover provides data useful for understanding the types of triggers, actions and rules actually composed by users, and whether they effectively exploit the personalization features offered.",

Having a framework to define the types and levels of automation in home technologies is necessary to better understand the state of the art, identify current and future directions for development, and facilitate communication between stakeholders. This paper reviews existing studies on smart home technologies and previous efforts around building taxonomies of automation in different domains. Literature around technology adoption among older adults and related design considerations are also discussed to further describe home automation as it applies to improving independence among older adults.",

The main idea is to lunch an open and dynamic eco-system to support the development of IoT based services both for the private and public sectors. The concept of pattern will lead the overall development of the SUMMIT platform which represents each element to be integrated in the SUMMIT framework by assuring security, privacy and dependability properties. Above patterns will be also self-evolving on the basis of their behavioral analysis to be performed during the system operation. The three main cases of study addressed by the project will be smart energy, smart health and smart cities. Among patterns addressed by the project the development of a smart inertial platform is considered. Such platform will find application in several contexts with a strong priority in the Smart Living framework. As an example, the architecture developed can be adopted for the sake of Activity of Daily Living monitoring (including Falls), postural instability detection, aided navigation, physical activity assessment, just to cite mostly addressed needs. Actually, above application contexts represent serious needs to be addressed to enable Active Ageing and Well Being. The Smart Inertial Pattern (SIP) is based on an embedded architecture equipped with sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass) and communication facilities. In this paper the use of the SIP device for the implementation of a ADL classifier exploiting an event correlated approach is presented.",

		"abstract": "With the increased success of Internet of Things (IoT), the conventional centralized cloud computing is encountering severe challenges (e.g., high latency, non-adaptive machine type of communication), that proved insufficient to meet the stringent requirements of IoT applications. Besides requiring fast response time, increased security and privacy, they lack computational resources at the edge of the network. Motivated to solve these challenges, new technologies are driving a trend that distributes the computational resources and shifts the function of centralized cloud computing to the edge. Several edge computing technologies, edge and fog paradigms, originating from different backgrounds have been emerging to overweight these challenges. However, to fully utilize these limited devices, we need advanced resource management techniques. In this paper, we present a novel distributed resource allocation algorithm with the purpose of enabling seamless integration and deployment of different applications in an IoT infrastructure. The algorithm decides: (i) the mapping of an IoT application at the edge of the network; (ii) dynamic migration of parts of the application, such that Service Level Agreement (SLA) is satisfied. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss our approach and the potential to minimize the latency of different IoT applications.",

To understand the nature and impact of privacy concerns, two empirical studies were conducted. In focus groups, privacy concerns and conditions are identified. Participants worry especially about illicit information abuse, but also about feelings of surveillance and loss of control. In a subsequent questionnaire study, privacy concerns and their impact on acceptance are quantified (n = 97). Privacy concerns are not as pronounced as are benefits of technology use and show less impact on acceptance. Differences between a fall detection system and remote monitoring of vital parameters are detected. Older adults are less positive towards care-assistive technologies than younger adults. Findings contribute to an understanding on how technologies should be designed to match the desires of potential users.",

Hence, the present study examined the use of ultrasonic whistles in home care with special attention given to older adults benefit and barrier perception. For this purpose, an online questionnaire was conducted (Nthinspace=thinspace188) focusing on people aged 50 years and older. Results revealed significant influences of the participants health status on the perception and attitudes towards aging. Further, a cluster analysis revealed three groups of participants differing distinctly in their perception of benefits and barriers of the described AAL technology based on ultrasonic whistles. Besides considerable evaluation differences, these groups were further characterized by impacts of gender, attitude towards aging, and a distinct intention to use the described technology. This studys outcomes contribute to a deeper understanding of age and the perception of aging in the context of AAL technology acceptance.",

Despite significant advancement in AAL technologies and smart systems, they have still not found the way into the nursing home of the older people. The reasons are manifold. On one hand, the development of such systems lack in addressing the requirements of the older people and caregivers of the organization and the other is the unwillingness of the older people to make use of assistive systems. A qualitative study was performed at a nursing home to understand the needs and requirements of the residents and caregivers and their perspectives about the existing AAL technologies.",

In this paper, we propose a hybrid and dynamic predictive model which utilizes higher order Markov models integrated with a situation ranking technique. More specifically, we employ a revised version of PageRank algorithm to take the properties of the situation-graph (structure and semantics) into account and dynamically rank the situations considering the users mental state. Then we apply rankings as prior probabilities in order to build the corresponding Markov model. Also, we utilize rankings to identify milestone situations and transitions in order to compress the representation model. Experiments show that the predictions obtained by this approach are more efficient and effective than the ones produced from the pure predictive graphical model-based approaches.",

Generally, supervised machine learning strategies or knowledge engineering strategies are employed in the process of activity modeling. Supervised machine learning approaches incur overheads in annotating the dataset, while the knowledge modeling approaches incur overhead by being dependent on the domain expert for occupant specific knowledge. The proposed approach on the other hand, employs an unsupervised machine learning strategy to readily extract knowledge from unlabelled data and subsequently represents it as ontology activity model. The novelty in the proposed design is in the usage of Contextual Pattern Clustering (CPC) for activity modeling. The competence of the weighted Jaro Winkler similarity measure introduced in CPC lies in the utilization of contextual attributes for the composition of varied event patterns of an activity. Hierarchical strategy employed in CPC offers structured knowledge on activities and sub activities within a specific location. Additionally, the event organizer and habitual event generator subsystem introduced in the proposed framework derives knowledge related to event ordering and contextual description of an activity. The attained knowledge is later represented as a probabilistic ontology activity model to enable probabilistic reasoning over domain knowledge. An experimental analysis with a smart home dataset demonstrates the proficiency of the proposed unsupervised approach in activity modeling and recognition in comparison with that of the existing modeling strategies.",

Preventive healthcare encourages health and averts disease or injuries by addressing factors that lead to the inception of a disease, and by detecting dormant conditions to reduce or cessation their progression. Preventive healthcare reduces the significant economic burden of disease in addition to improving the length and quality of outpatients lives. Machine Learning (ML) Infused Preventive Healthcare goes one step ahead by application of algorithms for collection of multi-scale clinical, biomedical, contextual, and environmental data about each outpatient (e.g., in Electronic Health Record (EHR)s, personal health records - PHR, etc.), unified and extensibility of metadata standards, and decision support tools to facilitate optimized patient-centered, evidence-based decisions. Through interweaving data, importantly, from traditional healthcare data sources such as outpatient Electronic Health Records (EHR) and revolutionary data sources such as mobile, voice and sensor generated outpatient contextual and lifestyle data, the machine learning (ML) infused preventive health care breeds new clinical pathways that are not only beneficial to the individual outpatients but can also improve overall population safety and health outcomes. In this research paper, we propose machine learning infused preventive health care and aims to solve one of the most important issues in the outpatient elderly healthcare prevention of injuries and outpatient caring.

		"abstract": "The phenomenon of ageing population is raising substantial pressure to the national health and welfare systems of many countries in the world, and can be a potential threat to social stability and economic development. IoT wearable medical technologies have the potential to aid this struggle, but anecdotal evidence showed that large-scale deployment of IoT wearable devices among the ageing population could be fraught with challenges, which have not been well reported in academic literature. Therefore, this paper aims to address this knowledge gap by reporting on an exploratory study that firstly investigated older peoples user requirements towards wearable medical devices and secondly explored potential challenges and difficulties for large-scale deployment of such devices. Five focus groups were conducted to collect insights and opinions respectively from five families (i.e. each contained 1--2 elderly members, accompanied with 2--4 family members who held caring responsibilities). The data collected was analyzed by using a thematic analysis approach. The results showed that elderly people have complicated and diverse user requirements towards IoT wearable medical devices, and that a range of challenges related to hardware providers, caregivers, legal regulations and technical features can affect large-scale deployment of such devices. The paper concluded that these identified user requirements and challenges should be carefully considered by wearable hardware designers, system developers, and service providers if they want their innovative products and services to be accepted and deployed among the ageing population globally.",

The Spanish region of Navarra and its capital city Pamplona are currently experiencing profound transformations which aim at integrating smart city-related innovations. In spite of the central relevance of the automobile industry for its economy, Pamplona is making efforts for consolidating alternatives to its private car-centred mobility. Intermodal transportation options offer a more sustainable and socially inclusive mobility-paradigm. This paper incorporates an analysis of the narratives and discourses of some of the key stakeholders in play, such as politicians, transportation experts and engineers.

Mobile cloud computing is a way of enriching users of mobile devices with the computational resources and services of clouds. The recent developments of mobile devices and their sensors introduced the crowd sensing paradigm that uses powerful cloud computing to analyze, manage and store data produced by mobile sensors. However, crowd sensing in the context of using the cloud is posing new challenges that increase the importance of adopting new approaches to overcome them. This chapter introduces a middleware solution that provides a set of services for cost-effective management of crowd sensing data.",

This study was intended to examine trends and outlook of smart care by type of elderly and situation to spur improvement in health management for the elderly. Smart cares by type of elderly and situation were elderly-friendly smart home, smart care for management of chronic diseases in the elderly, and smart care for the elderly living alone. Smart care is needed to be implemented actively not only to reduce medical costs and improve the quality of medical services but also to ensure safety and quality of life for the elderly. However, multi-faceted efforts need to be made to help overcome the difficulties arising from degraded cognitive function of the elderly, considering the basic orientation of smart care such as mobile, smart, cloud computing, IoT, etc. For that, it would be necessary to develop elderly-friendly devices suited for characteristics of the elderly group and to actively deploy professional manpower, in parallel with active support from related organizations, who can provide instant support to the elderly encountering difficulty with the use, so as to stimulate the smart care service in the period ahead. Furthermore, as health information and privacy information generated in connection with individuals are sensitive data, it would be the most important to ensure that strict security is maintained for safe data transmission and that only necessary part of information is shared selectively.",

For this purpose, a mixed-method design, involving several assessments, a guideline-based interview, a task-based investigation and a questionnaire using a gesture catalog, was applied. The whole sample included 20 seniors being 60 years and older. In the process, qualitative requirements were collected on the topics of device use, operating problems, desired devices for gesture control, receiver unit, gestures, feedback and safety. The interview results emphasized the elderly participants needs to an easy and intuitive system use. Furthermore, concerns should be prioritized in order to the development of the system. In the quantitative evaluation, the use of various technical devices was analyzed and the frequency of used gestures was determined based the gesture catalog and the task-based investigation. The most frequently used gestures were horizontal, vertical, circular and targeting gestures. In summary, the elderly people were very interested in, and open-minded towards, the SP-system. In a comparison between healthy persons and persons with tremor, the results demonstrated only minimal differences regarding the requirements.",

The majority of current fall detection applications require specially designed hardware and software which make them expensive and inaccessible to the general public. We demonstrated that by collecting accelerometer data from a smartwatch and processing those data in a paired smartphone, it is possible to reliability detect (93.8% accuracy) whether a person has encountered a fall in real-time. By wearing a smartwatch as a piece of jewelry, the well-being of a person can be monitored in real-time at anytime and anywhere as contrasted to being confined in a particular facility installed with special sensors and cameras. Using simulated fall data acquired from volunteers, we trained a fall detection model off-line that can be composed with a data collection accessor to continuously analyze accelerometer data gathered from a smartwatch to detect minor or serious fall at anytime and anywhere. The accessor-based architecture allows easy composition of the fall-detection IoT application tailored to heterogeneity of devices and variation of users need.",

		"abstract": "In the course of demographic change, an increasing proportion of older people in need of care pose enormous burdens for the care sectors of todays society, which could dramatically aggravate in the next decades. Developing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies is one approach to support older people and people in need of care to live as long as possible independently at their own home. Besides technical opportunities and functions, future users acceptance is decisive for the success and long-term usage of innovative technologies. Thus, for AAL technologies it has to be explored which factors are crucial for acceptance and to what extent those factors differ with regard to diverse user groups. Referring to existing technology acceptance models (in particular the UTAUT2-model), it is questionable whether such models can be adapted and are appropriately usable for the context of AAL technologies. In this paper, we therefore investigate potential users attitudes towards AAL systems as well as the importance and relationships of technology-related and user-specific characteristics in a scenario-based online questionnaire study using an adapted and extended version of the UTAUT2-model. The undertaken adaption led to a better understanding of influencing factors for AAL acceptance: privacy concerns need to be addressed as an additional predictor. Regarding user factors, age, Attitude Towards Technology (ATT), and caregiving experience were revealed as influencing factors, whereas gender and health status did not show any effects on AAL acceptance.",

There are widely recognised benefits to both the individual and society from supporting people to live independently for longer in their own homes. However, falls in particular have been found to be a leading cause of the elderly moving into care, and yet surprisingly preventative approaches are not in place; fall detection and rehabilitation are too late. In this paper we present FITsense, which is building a Smart Home environment to identify increased risk of falls for residents, and so allow timely interventions before falls occurs. An ambient sensor network, installed in the Smart Home, identifies low level events taking place which is analysed to generate a residents profile of activities of daily living (ADLs). These ADL profiles are compared to both the residents typical profile and to known risky profiles to allow evidence-driven intervention recommendations. Human activity recognition to identify ADLs from sensor data is a key challenge. Here we compare a windowing-based and a sequence-based event representation on four existing datasets. We find that windowing works well, giving consistent performance but may lack sufficient granularity for more complex multi-part activities.",

Specially, video cameras are also integrated into the IOT network of sensors to capture the individuals activity and dressing condition, which are important factors affecting ones thermal sensation. The individuals condition image can be mapped into different metabolic rates and different clothing insulations by machine learning classification algorithm. Then, all the captured or converted data are fed into a PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model to learn the individuals thermal comfort level. In the prediction stage, we introduce the cuckoo search algorithm to solve the air temperature and air velocity with the learnt thermal comfort level, which is convergent rapidly. Our experiments demonstrate that the metabolic rates and clothing insulation have great effect on personal thermal comfort, and our model with video capture helps to obtain the variant values regularly, thus maintains the individuals thermal comfort balance in spite of the variation of activity or clothing.",

Many Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods are data-driven, where the quality of collected data can significantly affect the accuracy of results. However, data collection for FDD of buildings is a challenging task as needed data is not typically readily available. In this paper we focus on the data collection for FDD of smart buildings.

		"abstract": "A key challenge elderly people face is the ability to live independently. Losing their everyday independence is a major concern for the elderly, partly because they fear this could lead to an involuntary move to an assisted living facility instead of living independently. Since 2015, the Dutch government encourages their citizens to age-in-place, but at the same time struggles with how to implement new healthcare regulations. To support both government and citizens, we propose a digital platform to match supply and demand in the health and wellbeing domain. Such a platform should not only enable end-users to enhance self-management, but also support them to find solutions for everyday problems related to aging-in-place. To illustrate our Action Design Research we established a Living Lab in a metropolitan area in the Netherlands, and developed a prototype of the proposed platform in a real-life setting.",

		"abstract": "In the context of twenty-first century, diabetes is one of the most lethal diseases from which millions of people of different age levels are suffering. It is imperative for a diabetes patient to maintain the blood glucose level all times as there is no stable solution for this disease. However, the infants and the elderly, suffering from diabetes might not have the notion of maintaining the level of sugar in their blood. So, constant monitoring of the patient has become the most feasible solution. But the traditional method for measuring blood glucose level is not a viable option for constant blood glucose monitoring. Even if this invasive method is more accurate, it is painful and also there is a risk of infection, although minimal. That is why the non-invasive method seems to be a reasonable option for the ongoing monitoring of blood glucose. For constant remote collection and monitoring of the data obtained from the diabetes patient, an IoT-based non-invasive monitoring system has been proposed in this research that can be a great aid, besides the invasive method for constant monitoring purposes.",

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a novel face recognition method for population search and criminal pursuit in smart cities. In large and medium-sized security, the face pictures of the most similar face images can be accurately searched in tens of millions of photos. The storage requires a powerful information processing center for a variety of information storage and processing. To fundamentally support the safe operation of a large system, cloud-based network architecture is considered and a smart city cloud computing data center is built. In addition, this paper proposed a cloud server architecture for face recognition in smart city environments.",

Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of these experiments would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services.",

This study aims to exploit deep learning techniques to learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminant latent patterns inherent in the low-level features. Specifically, we first adopt a stacked autoencoder to extract high-level features, and then integrate feature extraction and classifier training into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. We use three benchmark datasets to evaluate our method, and investigate two different original sensor data representations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition rate and generalizes better across different original feature representations compared with other four competing methods.",

To address this challenge we developed a flexible and scalable multi-agent system for sensor data collection, integration, processing, and alert management.

		"abstract": "Currently, there is a rising number of elderly people worldwide. By 2020 the percentage of elderly people aged 60+ years should reach 30 % out of the total number of population living in the developed European countries This aging process, however, results in new economic and social issues Therefore there is constant effort to prolong and maintain the active age of these elderly people, who want to lead active, fulfilling and quality life in terms of inclusion, socialization and independence. This can be achieved not only by a continuous support from their family members, but also with the help of modern information and communication technologies (ICT), which can assist elderly people in this process. The purpose of this article is to explore benefits and limitations of using ICT, particularly the smart ones, by the elderly people. In addition, the author of this study emphasizes the importance of appropriate training about the benefits of smart technologies.",

Our hypothesis is that the addition of a structural representation and transitional features will improve performance for the corresponding prediction tasks of different networks. We apply our graphical feature-based approach on smart phone GPS sensor data to predict activities performed by phone users. We represent the location category corresponding to each GPS value as a node and movement of users from one GPS location to another as an edge in graph. Then we extract graphical features such as existence of nodes and edges from the graph representation and add them to basic sensor data features coming from the smart phone. We find that using this augmented feature set improves activity recognition accuracy by 7.27% compared to using only basic non-graphical features with feature set augmented with existence of nodes performing the best.",

Activity recognition in smart homes uses large amounts of time-series sensor data to infer daily living activities and to extract effective features from those activities, which is a challenging task. In this paper we demonstrate the use of the CNN and a comparison of results, which has been performed with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), recurrent neural networks and other machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models, Hidden Semi-Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields.

We proposed a system for automatic control of appliances as well as power reduction module. When the user enters into the room, the light and fan will turn ON automatically, and while the user exits, it will turn OFF automatically using PIR sensor. Based on the presence of the user, the power reduction module switches the appliances in the span. It also controls the speed of fan based on room temperature with LM-35 sensor.

In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of non-intrusive sensor systems to detect socially isolated community dwelling elderly. Using a mixed method approach, our results showed that sensor-derived features such as going-out behavior, daytime napping and time spent in the living room are associated with different social isolation dimensions. The average time spent outside home is associated with the social loneliness level, social network score and the overall social isolation level of the elderly and the time spent in the living room is positively associated with the emotional loneliness level. Further, elderly who perceived themselves as socially lonely tend to take more naps during the day time. The findings of this study provide implications on how a non-intrusive sensor-based monitoring system comprising of motion-sensors and a door contact sensor can be utilized to detect elderly who are at risk of social isolation.",

		"abstract": "Against the background of demographic change, todays society is getting increasingly older. In order to handle growing care needs and shortages of skilled workers, ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies provide prevention and rehabilitation measures which facilitate aging in place and relieve caregivers. In this context, ultrasonic whistles could represent an innovative assistance system for home automation, safety prevention, positioning, and motion analysis. However, the acceptance of AAL-technologies is challenging due to perceived restrictions, e.g., on privacy and autonomy, and depends on individual attitudes, demands, and concerns. As health impairments and care dependency increase with age, research focus is set on age-related user factors. We examined user-specific concepts of aging in relation to the assessment of ultrasonic whistles in home care. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews and a scenario-based ground plan interaction were conducted. Results indicate that particularly positive or negative associations with aging affect AAL-acceptance, strongly related to issues of quality of life, active aging, social integration, dealing with change, health, and care dependency. Regarding trade-offs between perceived benefits and barriers, users with positive concepts of aging consider AAL as relief to maintain autonomy, ensure safety prevention, and facilitate everyday life whereas users with negative concepts of aging express concerns about dependency on technology, loss of control, restrictions on privacy, and data security. The findings contribute to an understanding of -aging concepts and their relation to care assistance that can be used for age-specific communication concepts.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, we live in environments where smart products enable new processes of human and non-human interaction. Smart concepts push functions beyond traditional levels of expectation. It is widely appraised that smart concepts enhance products to make them respond to human needs and expectations. However, regardless of the level of complexity and intelligence of those products (regardless of scale, from home environment to an object), if the environment is non-user-friendly, users will reject them and eventually abandon them. Conceptualizing intelligent solutions is more often centered on the requirements of functions and overlooks the profile of users, a critical aspect to outline the experience. Present-day interaction between users and smart products should be enabled by their physical model, finishing, interface features and functional capabilities. The quality of experience is not only grounded on the type and efficiency of the task performed. The quality of the experience depends on: the physical experience (dimension, height, shape, finishing); the sensorial experience (how does the artifact stimulate the sensorial human system); the cognitive experience (how easy it is to interact with technology) and the emotional experience (is this a pleasant experience? Would we repeat it?) Moreover, outlining the users demands and expectations from environments, products and technology is also critical to reach qualified and appealing solutions. The aim of this paper is to establish the need of taking a different approach when conceptualizing smart environments and products, arguing that users can only understand inherent intelligence if the parameters that sponsor an emotional appealing experience are considered throughout the design process.",

In order to minimize the error between inputs and desired outputs, we optimize some criteria of the network to gain good results.

They were trying to get data on people out of the on-board diagnostics. Not only the speed, et cetera, to do pay-as-you-drive insurance, but also the location information from the on-board diagnostics. This is similar to the government U-turn on health privacy that we heard about from Ross. And most of the times, the software that lies in my car (or in my toaster) I do not own or control. Its owned by the company who manufactured it. Like, the Jeeps that John Deere manufactures, they say that the software is owned by them. The user has no access, no control, nothing to do with it.

Most older adults prefer to live in their own home, but many live alone without immediate support. Living longer is often coupled with health and social problems and difficulty managing daily activities. Therefore, some level of care is required, but this is costly. Technological solutions may help to mitigate these problems by recognising subtle changes early and intervening before problems become unmanageable. Understanding a persons usual behaviour when carrying out Activities of Daily Living (ADL) makes it possible to detect and respond to anomalies. However, current commercial and research monitoring systems do not offer an analysis of ADL and are unable to detect subtle changes. To address this gap, we propose the STRETCH (Socio-Technical Resilience for Enhancing Targeted Community Healthcare) sensor platform that is comprised of non-invasive sensors and machine learning techniques to recognise changes and allow early interventions. The paper discusses design principles, modalities, system architecture, and sensor network architecture.",

Traditional models of episodic health care will not be sufficient to meet changing health care needs and the reorientation of services towards maintaining function as opposed to treating illness. One strategy to meet these challenges is an increased focus on self-care via use of broader social networks and seamless integration of applications with lifestyle activities, particularly for people with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. There has also been a rapid increase in a range of technologies for connecting different components of the health system and delivering services through smartphones and connected devices. Our proposal is to pursue systems development in healthcare in a way that considers a range of aspects known as SHARP: Sustainable, Holistic, Adaptive, Real-time and Precise. This approach will provide solutions that will be useful and effective for managing the long-term well-being of individuals.",

Besides aspects of technical development and implementation, user acceptance of diverse stakeholders plays a major role for a successful rollout and sustainable adoption of those technologies. So far, user acceptance research in this context has concentrated mostly on age-related issues. In contrast, disabilities and related care needs have hardly been researched yet. The current study focused on persons having different experiences with disabilities and care needs. In a qualitative interview pre-study (nthinspace=thinspace9) and a follow-up quantitative online questionnaire study (nthinspace=thinspace279) perceived benefits and barriers, use conditions, and acceptance of AAL technologies were contrasted. Four user groups were under study: disabled participants, relatives of disabled persons, professional caregivers, and, as a control group, persons without experience with disabilities. Results indicate that disabled and care-needy people show a higher acceptance and intention to use an AAL system than not-experienced people and especially professional caregivers. The motives for acceptance and rejection differ strongly regarding user diversity as well. The results contribute to a better understanding of user-specific acceptance of smart home and AAL technologies and show that the integration of diverse user groups into the technologies design and evaluation process is necessary.",

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies represent one approach to face these challenges. Besides technological developments and implementations, focusing on user acceptance (including diverse stakeholder perspectives) is important for a successful rollout. As the most previous studies focus on age-related issues, this paper emphasizes especially on people with care needs due to a disability. In particular the acceptance of an AAL system is investigated considering the trade-off between perceived benefits (e.g., increasing autonomy) and perceived barriers (e.g., invasion in privacy, to abandon data security). Using a quantitative online questionnaire, decisive use conditions are identified, and the trade-offs and AAL-acceptance are evaluated comparing four user groups: healthy people without experiences with disabilities, disabled people, family members, and professional care givers. Results indicate that experience with disabilities influence the acceptance and relevant use conditions of AAL systems as well as the trade-offs between benefits and barriers. The results demonstrate the relevance to include diverse user groups (age, diseases, disabilities) and their specific needs and wishes into the design and evaluation process of AAL technologies.",

Findings from the surveys which were conducted with a group of elderly respondents in the senior homes and findings from the interview with a young lector teaching old generation show the issue in the local city environment. A question on benefits of organized course for the elderly from the questionnaire explores the survey from four perspectives and brings enriching findings.

In this empirical study, we explore users perceptions on safety and privacy in the context of surveillance systems. In order to understand if the acceptance of surveillance depends on usage contexts, surveillance technologies in the urban were compared to the medical context. Using an online survey, 119 users were requested to indicate their acceptance regarding different types of surveillance contexts and technologies, differentiating perceived benefits and barriers as well as safety and privacy needs. We investigate acceptance differences towards surveillance technologies at various locations (private and public) as well.

The aims are to identify variances of life transitions in relation to domestic practices, investigate the association between life transitions and digital engagement at home, and evaluate the possibilities for incorporating digital domestic ecosystems into the daily lives of older adults. The study makes three main propositions: digital domestic practices are influenced by financial decision-making processes in households; life transitions and changes in social and personal relationships influence the emergence and creation of digital practices at home; and the appropriation of digital domestic ecosystems requires social and cultural changes regarding the desirability and accessibility of digital services. To this end, the study considers the extent to which the concept of life stages could be taken into consideration in the digital design of domestic practices among older people in Finland.",

In this paper, we discuss the challenges in human-computer interaction (HCI), in the context of our experience with two applications designed to support older adults. The first is an in-home sensor system for detecting early signs of health changes and managing chronic health conditions. The second is an interactive remote physical therapy system that connects a therapist in the clinic with an older adult in the home. An overview of each application is presented. We discuss HCI challenges across these two applications.",

By using this activity zone concept, the proposed scheme uses Markov Logic Network (MLN) which integrates a common sense knowledge (i.e. area of each activity) with a probabilistic model. The proposed scheme can utilize only a positioning sensor attached to a resident with/without power meters attached to appliances of a smart environment. We target 10 different living activities which cover most of our daily lives at a smart environment and construct activity recognition models. Through experiments using sensor data collected by four participants in our smart home, the proposed scheme achieved average F-measure of recognizing 10 target activities starting from 84.14 % to 94.53 % by using only positioning sensor data.",

Thus, the development of smart interactive textiles requires the expertise of various disciplines. Foremost, appropriate conductive yarns must be selected and integrated into conventional fabrics. Sensors and actuators must be embedded in textiles in a way that they could be used as a user interface. The design of these textiles should meet human needs and should enable an intuitive, easy to learn, and effective interaction. To meet these requirements, potential users should be part of the development and evaluation processes of innovative smart textiles. In this article, we present a research framework that integrates several interdisciplinary perspectives (interface design, textile technology, integration and automation, communication and human factors).

In a survey with $$n=136$$participants, we identified and quantified factors that influence the adoption and rejection of a smart cushion as example for digital textiles. We found that attitude towards technology and attitude towards automation are decisive for the projected acceptance, while age plays a minor role. In addition, we provide a customer segmentation based on the projected use and provide detailed descriptions of adopters and rejecters as well as their model-based evaluations of the smart interactive cushion.

This paper suggests a user-centered ethical assessment (UCEA) framework for WT to be able to evaluate ethical consequences as a part of the user-centered aspects. Building on established methodologies from research on ethical considerations, as well as the research domain of human-computer interaction, this assessment framework joins knowledge of ethical consequences with aspects affecting the digitalization with the individual in the center, e.g. privacy, safety, well-being, dignity, empowerment and usability. The framework was applied during development of an interface for providing symptom information to Parkinson patients. The results showed that the UCEA framework directs the attention to values emphasized by the patients. Thus, functionality of the system was evaluated in the light of values and expected results of the patients, thereby facilitating follow-up of a user-centered assessment. The framework may be further developed and tested, but in this study it served as a working tool for assessing ethical consequences of WT as a part of user-centered aspects.",

As such there is a great demand for technologies that support the independent and safe living of the elderly and ensuring that they are not socially isolated. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have thus emerged to support the elderly people in their daily activities, while removing the need of caregivers being always physically present in order to look after the elderly. The current AAL systems are intelligent enough to take critical decisions in emergency situations like a fall, fire or a cardiac arrest, hence the elderly can live safely and independently. In this abstract, we describe our solution that aims at integrating all relevant functionalities of an AAL system, based on feedback collected from representative users. This work is carried out in the European Union project called CAMI (Artificially intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL).",

		"abstract": "Video game-based interventions have been increasingly explored as a means to prevent or reverse age-related declines in attention, executive control, memory, and processing speed. Further, the gamification of interventions aimed at improving mental and physical health, and encouraging healthy behaviors, holds promise with respect to promoting intervention engagement and adherence. Successful implementation of game-based and gamified interventions depends on the ability to design games that older adults are willing and able to play, which ultimately depends on understanding the game preferences of older adults, and the challenges and barriers to video gameplay. To explore these issues, this paper presents data collected from U.S. participants as part of the Intervention Comparative Effectiveness for Adult Cognitive Training (ICE-ACT) clinical trial. This trial aimed to understand the impact of various interventions on cognition and everyday task performance. Three intervention arms involved video game play: BrainHQ training (gamified cognitive training), Rise of Nations training (commercial complex real-time strategy game), and a control group that played Sudoku, crossword, and word search computer programs. After each game session, participants rated their game experience and provided comments in a game diary. This paper presents analyses of these diary data. The largest differences observed were between attitudes toward the control games and Rise of Nations. Control games were strongly preferred and were perceived as more motivating compared to Rise of Nations, and there was a trend for Rise of Nations to be perceived as more frustrating than BrainHQ. The observed preference for puzzle games, and an aversion for the violent and complex content of Rise Nations, is consistent with previous survey and focus group data of older adults game preferences. Results have implications for designing game-based and gamified interventions for older adults that will encourage enjoyment, engagement, and adherence.",

Our study contributes to this field with a mixed-methods intervention study that combines a baseline and follow-up telephone survey with semi-structured interviews to evaluate the user experience and potentially identifies additional acceptance factors of e-care systems and relations among them. Different assistive technologies were tested and evaluated by three groups of participants: (1) older adults testing mobile and wearable devices and (2) informal carers who remotely monitored events recorded by e-care systems installed in the homes of (3) care receivers. The findings indicate heterogeneous needs and expectations these three groups have towards the use of e-care systems. Moreover, the results also unveil the fear of not getting help quickly in case of an emergency, and perception of safety and peace of mind as important predictors of the use of e-care systems among informal carers and care receivers. Indirectly, the results also reveal the importance of intervention and mixed methods design studies as a means of a more comprehensive understanding of acceptance factors of assistive technologies.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, more and more exhibition centers and store owners are deploying beacon devices to implement location-based services. However, the beacon technology can only provide one-way communication. If we need the smartphones to respond to the beacon messages, the smartphone users have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. In some cases the mobile Internet services may not be always available. Therefore, we develop an interactive positioning and tracking system based solely on the BLE technology. Specifically, we make the beacon devices capable of two-way communication. On one hand, our beacon devices can detect the presence of a specific customer at specific locations, and then the presence information can be sent to the application server via the BLE mesh network consisting of beacon devices. On the other hand, the application server can send a personalized location-based message to the customer, again via the relay of beacon devices. The benefit of our system is two-fold: not only the customers without Internet connections can enjoy the positioning services, but also the backend system can be aware of the presence of specific customers and track their real-time locations. Experimental results showed that our system is practicable with moderate transmission latencies in the BLE mesh network.",

According to input received from stakeholders of Irish-based communities of people with different abilities, one of the main barriers for users relates to a reduced level of accessibility when controlling media devices. The aim of this work is to improve users autonomy by providing tools that enhance users abilities with media device functionalities through the use of configurable prototypes of media assistive controllers. The output of the work is a proof of concept version of a methodology that matches user ability profiles to configurations of the corresponding functionalities of media assistive devices according to the Universal Design approach. This framework enables people with different abilities to independently engage with a media controller, through a multi-level interaction approach. It also facilitates users who become proficient at using a device at one level to improve their capabilities to a more complex level, requiring additional users interaction. Finally, it provides an example of how the ICF can be leveraged to suggest accessibility configuration parameters for devices of this type.",

Research on new models of care organisation demonstrates that advanced technologies and ICT systems and services may have the potentiality to respond to the increasing burden of diabetes and the complexity of managing it, and, in doing so, to contribute to the sustainability of health and care systems. In this paper we propose the development of a new Personalized Integrated Predictive Diabetes Management System, based on a design-driven approach in contrast with the technology--driven one generally used in medical field. The Novel System here presented is called Dia_Friend, an integrated care models, oriented to the needs of the user and focused on the way technology is used and shaped for him, instead of on the mere instrumental use of it.",

		"abstract": "Smart homes offer considerable potential to facilitate aging at home and, therefore, to reduce healthcare costs, both in financial and human resources. To implement the smart home dream, an artificial intelligence has to be able to identify, in real-time, the ongoing activity of daily living with a fine-grained granularity. Despite the recent and ongoing improvements, the limitation of the literature on this subject primarily concerns the quality of the information which can be inferred from standard ubiquitous sensors in a smart home. Passive Radio-Frequency Identification is one of the technology that can help improving activity recognition through the tracking of the objects used by the resident in real-time. This paper builds upon the literature on objects tracking to propose a machine learning scheme exploiting statistical features to transform the signal strength into useful qualitative spatial information. The method has an overall accuracy of 95.98%, which is an improvement of 8.26% over previous work.",

However, living longer with quality, also brings new challenges to governments, and to the society as a whole. One of the most significant consequences will be the increasing pressure on the healthcare services. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems can greatly improve healthcare scalability and reach while keeping the user in their home environment. The work presented in this paper specifies, implements, and validates a smart environment system that aggregates Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The specification includes a reference architecture, composed by three modules, whose tasks are to automate and standardize the collection of data, to relate and give meaning to that data and to learn from it. The system is able to identify daily living activities with different levels of complexity using a temporal logic. It enables a real time response to emergency situations and also a long term analysis of the user daily routine useful to induce healthier lifestyles. The implementation addresses the applications and techniques used in the development of a functional prototype. To demonstrate the system operation three use cases with increasing levels of complexity are proposed and validated. A discussion on related projects is also included, specifically on automation applications, Knowledge Representation (KR) and Machine Learning (ML).",

The study is restricted to solutions that envisage the TV device as the main user interface for supporting Ambient Assisted Living. From the survey, a basic set of services and interfaces, here described, appear to be fundamental for improving digital and social inclusion, but the design methodology for developing TV-based interfaces and services must be carefully chosen to reduce social marginalization.",

Instead of using traditional interface methodologies such as keyboards, mice, touchscreens, or remote controls for each appliance in smart home users can send commands to these devices by their hand gestures. This paper presents a system of hand gesture interface based on a single depth silhouette for appliance control in smart home. The core goal of our work is to create a user-friendly interface system which can identify specific hand gestures and use them to control appliances in smart home environments. To control appliances with hand gestures, we use both static and dynamic hand gesture model to generate control commands. In our methodologies, we first recognize the hand parts in a depth silhouette via the trained random forests (RFs). Then based on the information of the recognized and tracked hand parts, we recognize static or dynamic hand gestures. Appliance control commands are finally generated according to our implemented appliance interfaces. With this interface system, users can control some typical appliances in smart home such as TV, fan, lighting, security camera, doors and change channels, temperature, and volume by just hand gestures.",

Dementia care entails prolonged effort in terms of money, time and manpower. Assistive health care system is therefore essential and is probable through a smart home, that offers Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) to its occupants. The objective of this work is to model an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for dementia care through the smart home. The innovation in the design of IDSS is to offer two levels of decision-making (1) Short-Term Decision-Making (STDM)---to raise suitable alerts for the abnormality detected in ADL (2) Long-Term Decision-Making (LTDM)---to decide on the progress in occupants developmental stage of dementia. The novelty in the design of STDM is to assimilate Random Forest (data driven) decision-making and Rule-based (knowledge-driven) decision-making within a single framework. Random Forest modeling provides better predictive accuracy through ensemble learning which is later combined with the domain specific knowledge to offer context-based decision-making. On the other hand, LTDM decides on occupants developmental stage of dementia through automation of Barthel score. Barthel score is a clinical measure to assess the stage of dementia through the level of dependency required by the occupant to complete his activities. The experimental analysis confirms the proficiency of the proposed IDSS in decision-making is better than existing approaches.",

However, training simulation instructors currently rely on direct observation and radio-based audio communication methods to observe behaviors and evaluate interactions of trainees to provide feedback to trainees during debriefing sessions. Such human-driven evaluative methods, while valuable, lose fidelity of information for learning due to working memory limitations and the minds inability to capture all relevant behavioral information in realtime and to provide relevant detailed information that is easily interpretable to instructors. Thus, there is a need and the potential to explore alternative data collection and processing methods leveraging advanced wireless technologies to attempt to enhance the effectiveness of simulation training process for emergency response, to ultimately help save lives and better prepare our communities building emergency and disaster resilience. In this paper, we present a multimodal streaming analytics system to support learning by leveraging a user-centered design approach in consultation with a regional fire and rescue training academy. This conceptualized system provides real-time collection, visualization, and analysis of heterogeneous data streams including location sensing using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, audio communication, video observations, as well as social media and 911 call log streams. We describe the associated design challenges and lessons learned from the initial prototyping activities to strive toward enhancing the situational awareness and learning of emergency response personnel and leadership instructors with iterative design cycles at the regional fire and rescue training academy.",

		"abstract": "The user-friendly and -intuitive interface for household appliances is considered as one of the highly promising fields for researches in the area of smart home and environment. Instead of traditional interface methodologies such as keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or remote control, users in smart home or environment can control smart appliances via their hand gestures. This chapter presents a novel hand gesture interface system via a single depth imaging sensor to control smart appliances in smart home and environment. To control the appliances with hand gestures, our system recognizes the hand parts from depth hand silhouettes and generates control commands. In our methodology, we first create a database of synthetic hand depth silhouettes and their corresponding hand parts-labelled maps, and then train a random forests (RFs) classifier with the database. Via the trained RFs, our system recognizes the hand parts from depth silhouettes. Finally based on the information of the recognized hand parts, control commands are generated according to our predefined logics. With our interface system, users can control smart appliances which could be TV, radio, air conditioner, or robots with their hand gestures.",

		"abstract": "Smart home technology became more and more widespread within recent years. They aim to make life easier and taking over unwanted tasks. In traditional homes, it is often not clear whether all windows and doors of a house are closed before inhabitants leave the home or go to sleep. However, this can be easily addressed by smart homes. We present a system based on opportunistically located ambient lights that assist inhabitants of a smart home in answering this question. In this paper, we show the concept of our system and the inhabitant-centered design process behind the development. The system was installed in a one-family smart home. We report on insights gained through data collected from this deployment over a period of six months. Within interviews, we found that the ambient light system gave inhabitants a more confident feeling about open doors/windows.",

		"abstract": "In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.",

This paper proposes a smart pain management system based on big data computing technologies. The system devises pain management strategies based on the relevant standards and patients data, and these strategies are identified, applied, and monitored by the system in real-time. A perpetual feedback loop is created among the system components and the outcomes are communicated to the stakeholders to enable reflections and continuous improvements in the pain management standards, strategies, and processes. The system architecture and its architectural components are described. A preliminary analysis is provided using handwritten and digital pain management related data.",

Each sensor node could operate in a stand-alone way or in a multi-sensor approach; in the last case, fuzzy logic data fusion techniques are implemented in a gateway in order to improve the robustness of the estimation of a physiological measure characterizing the level of physical activity and specific parameters for the quantification of a sedentary lifestyle. The automatic assessment was conducted through two main algorithmic steps: (1) recognition of well-defined set of human activities, detected by ambient and wearable sensor nodes, and (2) estimation of a physiological measure, that is (MET)-minutes. The overall accuracy for activity recognition, obtained using simultaneously ambient and wearable sensors data, is about 5% higher of single sub-system and about 2% higher of that obtained with more than one ambient sensor. The effectiveness of the platform is demonstrated by the relative error between IPAQ-SF score (used as ground-truth, in which a low score corresponds to a sedentary lifestyle whereas a high score refers to moderate-to-vigorous activity level) and average measured (MET)-minutes obtained by both sensor technologies (after data fusion step), which never exceeds 7%, thus confirming the advantage of data fusion procedure for different aged people used for validation.",

Use of technologies and services designed to make life easier for the general population can also be leveraged to reduce the burden and stress related with caregiving. In this study, 30 family caregivers were surveyed in depth to learn about their experiences with various technologies and services. Questions covered caregivers use of technologies and services, perceived usefulness and ease of use, reasons for use and non-use, and ideas for new and improved tools. Many caregivers were currently using a technology or service for caregiving, but most of the technologies and services presented in the questionnaire were only used by a limited number of participants. While usage was limited, those that currently used technologies and services generally found them helpful for making caregiving duties easier. Responses showed that technologies and services were not being widely used mainly due to limited awareness and availability, and less because of lack of interest.",

Engineers need to have good understanding of the human body and different sorts of diseases, before they can apply good engineering solutions to solve the medical problems. However, teaching engineering students without prior education in medical-related aspects could be challenging.

		"abstract": "Remote Control Systems (RCSs) are increasingly being installed in homes and offices. Technology evolves very rapidly and sensors and devices are becoming smaller, smarter and more powerful. Mobile and Web apps are commonly used to remotely configure and control devices. Home control is especially valuable for blind people, since they can benefit from technology to control and turn on/off devices autonomously. Remote control can offer meaningful support, especially when devices are not directly accessible (e.g., thermostat to manage heating temperature). Therefore, if RCS interfaces are not accessible via screen reader, blind users may miss a great opportunity to achieve greater autonomy at home. This paper investigates the accessibility of the web user interfaces offered by RCSs for blind people. To do this, the Fibaro, a popular Remote Control System, was tested as a case study by analyzing the interaction via screen reader. Results indicate that accessibility and especially usability need to be improved to make interaction easier and more satisfying for blind people. To this aim, some suggestions are offered to aid developers in designing more accessible RCS user interfaces.",

		"abstract": "For impaired people, the conduction of certain daily life activities is problematic due to motoric and cognitive handicaps. For that reason, assistive agents in ambient assisted environments provide services that aim at supporting elderly and impaired people. However, these agents act in complex stochastic and indeterministic environments where the concrete effects of a performed action are usually unknown at design time. Furthermore, they have to perform varying tasks according to the users context and needs, wherefore an agent has to be flexible and able to recognize required capabilities in a certain situation in order to provide adequate, unobtrusive assistance. Hence, an expressive representation framework is required that relates user-specific impairments to required agent capabilities. This work presents an approach which (a) describes and links user impairments and capabilities using the formal, model-theoretic semantics expressed in OWL2 DL ontologies, (b) computes optimal policies through Reinforcement Learning and propagates these in an agent network. The presented approach improves the collaborative, personalized and adequate assistance of assistive agents and tailors the agent-based services to the users missing capabilities.",

In this paper, using the environmental sensing, we propose a new service that allows individual users to customize definition of anomaly and corresponding actions. Specifically, borrowing a mechanism of context-aware services, we regard every anomaly observed within the house as a context. We then define every care as an action bound to an anomaly context. This achieves the personalized anomaly detection and care. To demonstrate the feasibility, we implement a prototype system and conduct a practical case study.",

		"abstract": "The aging population is getting larger and the demands for social robots in providing home-based care services is increasing. As social robots are new technology and have not fully reached domestic fields, this study explored aging adults acceptance of social robots in a domestic environment. This study adopted the adapted UTAUT to develop aging adults acceptance. The model in this study involved both utilitarian use and pleasure-oriented use of social robots perceived by aging adults. A questionnaire survey involving 277 valid responses was conducted. This study examined that both pleasure expectancy and the four influencing constructs in UTAUT showed significantly positive effects on user adoption of social robots. In addition, based on the results, aging adults slightly did not think they could get pleasure from social robots whereas they had slightly preference to accept social robots. Implications were discussed for future work.",

		"abstract": "This paper confronts commonly-made assumptions about older adults and their general levels of capability when interacting with technology by reporting from an evaluation involving 49 older adults (M = 81 years) where performance was studied during task solving on a touch-based interface. The tasks involved were derived from a set of corresponding psychomotor abilities that are commonly involved in interaction mechanisms associated with touchscreen devices: precision, steadiness, dexterity, speed, and coordination. The evaluation consisted of measuring the performance of participants as well as having them assessing their own performance. To provide empirical results on why it is argued that it can be dangerous to assume anything about the capabilities of older adults, multiple analyses of the gathered data were used to highlight individual, group-related, and general patterns. Important relations, levels of variance, and statistically significant effects are highlighted as the paper argues for how these particular results do not align with common assumptions. The discussion draws on both the empirical results as well as related research to advocate why designers should acknowledge individual capabilities to ensure maximized performance when designing enabling technology for older adults.",

Moreover, most of these systems are not focused in supporting specific voice recognition scenarios, such as assistive applications for elder or disabled people, or consider a triggered close talking voice interaction. This paper focuses in building a prototype system for Romanian language, to be used in distant speech recognition scenarios, for voice driven speech applications in intelligent homes or buildings.

In this paper, an efficient and low-cost wireless security system is proposed with ZigBee and GSM modems. In the proposed system, city is divided into sections and sections into colonies/sectors. The section security system comprises multiple cluster nodes with one cluster head. Cluster nodes and cluster head are linked via ZigBee network. The cluster heads of all sections communicate with central control room (main server) of the city via GSM in order to make its coverage area large. The network optimization for efficient routing of the cluster node and cluster head is done using PSO algorithm. Cluster node is an embedded device connected with ZigBee modem and switches in each room as per users requirement. If there is an intrusion at home, in any locality of the city, the resident is to press the switch. This information is communicated by cluster node through ZigBee network to the corresponding cluster head which in turn communicates to the central control room (main server) via GSM network. Cluster head is equipped with audio alarm system like a hooter and this system is activated as soon as the switch in the cluster node is pressed. The identity of cluster node is conveyed to the cluster head via communication network. For future enhancement, the system in the cluster node may be fitted with other sensors like temperature, smoke, fire, etc., for detection of various hazardous conditions.",

Unfortunately, most people suffering from sleep disorders remain without diagnosis and treatment since the current sleep assessment systems are cumbersome and expensive. As a result, there is an increasing demand for cheaper and more affordable sleep monitoring systems in real-life environments. In this paper, we propose a novel non-intrusive system for sleep quality monitoring using a microbend fiber optic mat placed under the bed mattress. The sleep quality is assessed based on different parameters. Moreover, the sensor has been integrated into an existing Ambient Assisted Living framework to be validated in real scenarios. Three senior female residents participated in our study and the sleep data was collected over a one-month period in a home-living situation. The proposed system shows accurate and consistent results with a survey collected from each participant showing their sleep patterns and other in-home activities.",

		"abstract": "Continuous monitoring of safety and health conditions are among the primary goals of Ambient Assisted Living technologies. Effective solutions, aimed at fostering independent life of elderly persons, need for carefully balancing system intrusiveness, perspicacity, reliability and cost features. Heterogeneous networks, including different combination of environmental and personal (wearable) sensors can be used, with relevant value coming from data fusion: analysis techniques, aiming at inferring safety and health-related information in an indirect fashion from behavioral features are being deeply investigated with this aim. Device cooperation and interoperability are thus key factors: in this paper, the development of a wearable sensor suitable for broad range AAL application is introduced, addressing features specifically oriented to behavioral analysis. First, the device itself is capable of analyzing different features of the user motion patterns, synthesizing high-level information (simple task identification, energy expenditure) on board. This result in better battery management (less data transferred over the radio link) and interoperability (thanks to data abstraction). Second, by means of a suitable operating protocol, it cooperates with environmental sensors (e.g., a toilet sensor) providing the latters with user identification information, and thus allowing to exploit related data even in a multi-user context. This avoid the need of more expensive and complex indoor localization techniques or of more intrusive identification technologies (e.g., NFC/RFID tags).",

The aim of the review study is to examine the exploitation of mobile phones and/or smartphones and their benefits and limitations for patients with dementia. The methods of this review involve literature search of accessible studies dealing with the topic on the exploitation of mobile phones and/or smartphones in dementia found in three acknowledged databases Science Direct, Web of Science, and MEDLINE. Furthermore, the results of the detected studies were compared and evaluated. The results of this article show that the use of mobile phones and/or smartphones by patients with dementia can provide support for the activities of daily life. In addition, they can reduce both mental and economic burden of their caregivers and help doctors in their assessments and diagnoses. Nevertheless, more original research studies, especially in the area of the effectiveness of their use should be conducted. The same is true for sustainable support in the use of mobile phones by patients with dementia.",

For a system to perform human activity recognition in a real-world environment, multiple requirements exist, such as scalability, robustness, ability to deal with uncertainty (e.g., missing sensor data), to operate with multi-occupants and to take into account their privacy and security. This paper attempts to address the requirements of scalability and robustness, by describing a reasoning mechanism based on modular spatial and/or temporal context models as a network of ontologies. The reasoning mechanism has been implemented in a smart home system referred to as Arianna$$^+$$.

Recently, the capacitive sensor technologies have been developed for proximity methods that sensing electronic varies around sensor detection point, but the user gesture signals are time-variant. The MRWNN have multi layers recursive weight to record last signal variation, and we utilize microcontroller with MRWNN to identify algorithms and implement proximity capacitive gesture recognition. Moreover, we show MRWNN weight convergence analysis of the MRWNN signal identifier. In the experimental results, we show MRWNN can recognize patterns of different gesture signal accurately and reliably. In addition, we use wearable device combined with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) feedback output response immediately.",

The complexity of medication regimens in this population can impede medication adherence (i.e., taking medications as prescribed), which may compromise the effectiveness of treatment and increase the cost and burden of illness. Different technological devices have been used to improve medication adherence, however, these devices are often not evidence-based or designed with end-user involvement, thereby affecting their acceptability by people living with dementia and their caregivers. This in turn, can influence the effectiveness and uptake of such devices. This study aims to explore the challenges of medication adherence for both older people with dementia and their caregivers to guide the development of future technological solutions that can be effective, practical and sustainable.",

However, the conventional systems have limitations of deployment cost and invasiveness, the effort of activity labeling, and a lack of communication. To cope with the limitations, we propose a system that captures activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, based on speech dialogue triggered by environment changes. Specifically, we deploy Autonomous Sensor Boxes, developed in our previous study, within a house of the elderly. The boxes gather and send house environmental data to the cloud. Then, the Change Finder algorithm is applied to the time-series data, to detect changes in the house online. On detecting a change, the Virtual Agent (VA) in the house asks the elderly what he/she is doing now. The elderly speaks to the VA, by which an ADL is recorded in the system. The proposed system can capture ADL with non-invasive sensing and create an opportunity for communication.",

This paper reports a systematic review of the roll of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) in elderly wellbeing, based on Cochrane principles. Relevant publications from diverse databases, including healthcare, engineering, and robotics were sourced and screened. Ninety-five studies in forty-two study groups have been synthesized. The reported outcomes have been categorized based on five PERMA constructs (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement) in addition to a sixth category (other effects). The findings indicate that SAR has the potential to enhance elderly wellbeing and decrease the workload of caregivers. Based on concerns that emerged during the quality appraisal process, several significant recommendations are made to improve future research and its applicability. Furthermore, acknowledging individuals needs, expectations, and preferences alongside multi-modal interaction and data collection translates into improvement of personalization of care. The development of new approaches such as web-based interfaces and cloud computing are highly recommended as the means of overcoming the constraints of the limited computing and storage capabilities of SAR. Moreover, human-like engagement characteristics of socially assistive robots should be seamlessly integrated with other assistive technologies such as tele-health, e-health, and smart homes.",

Consequently, in conversational service robot scenarios (including elderly care use cases), humans often have the expectation that humanoid robots are capable of preserving the privacy and confidentiality of a given human-robot dialogue. In this literature, we explore the inherent challenges and approaches to modeling confidentiality in human-robot interaction (HRI) dialogue scenarios involving a cloud-enabled networked robot.

Furthermore, a practical workflow is presented, that helps the technicians that setup the device to perform a fast, user-friendly and robust tuning and calibration procedure. As a result, the technician is capable of training the device without any need for prior knowledge of machine learning techniques. The proposed system has been evaluated against a particular scenario that is rather important in the context of any healthcare monitoring system for the elder: In particular, we have focused on the bathroom scenario according to which, a Raspberry PI device equipped with a single microphone is used to monitor bathroom activity on a 24/7 basis in a privacy-aware manner, since no audio data is stored or transmitted. The presented experimental results prove that the proposed framework can be successfully used for audio event recognition tasks.",

This paper proposed a descriptive Tomographic Content Analysis method to analyze the cross-section of chronic disease knowledge network. K-core values and clustering coefficients were applied to divide the network into layers. Then vectors for each layer were constructed to calculate their cosine similarities to compare their correlation and differences. Finally, network stratification results were compared with the community modules obtained by the traditional social network analysis from a quantitative perspective. To illustrate the method, a number of 26,717 articles related to hypertension in the PubMed database were taken as examples to construct the chronic disease knowledge network. Results show that the chronic disease knowledge network can be divided into the basic layer, the middle layer and the detailed layer. The basic layer can be used to divide the main research directions of chronic diseases. The detailed layer can be used to characterize the specific research and reveal the microscopic forms of the network. The middle layer can be used to explore the network intersection and evolution paths. Compared with the traditional social network analysis method, our proposed method can obtain more in-depth and detailed hierarchical structures and internal correlations of chronic disease knowledge networks.",

In this work, an attempt has been taken into consideration to develop an intelligent e-healthcare system. In e-healthcare system the entities are considered as the patient, the physician, the pathological centre and result as diagnosis, treatment and post care. This paper uses an ANFIS structure for e-healthcare system. Further the ANFIS system is used for disease diagnosis and support to the patient as well as for physicians. For the management of multi-agent system has been satisfied by, using rule based fuzzy parameters. The service can be provided through internet to the patient as well as by the physician. The different situation of patient automatically informs to the doctor similarly the prescription from the doctor for diagnosis can inform to the pathology centre and vice versa. The result of detection communicated to both for desired medicine, monitoring and post care purpose. The performance found to be excellent to satisfy this part of intelligent system.",

		"abstract": "Sustainable transport is one of the key challenges of the UN and EU to ensure to meet societys economic, social and environmental needs whilst minimising undesirable impacts. Sustainability planning may require changing the way we solve transportation problems. From the perspectives of the sustainability, we may assume that the emphasis should move in direction to changing the practice: but exactly what practice and whos practices are to be changed? One way is to investigate gendered mobilities. The main differences in mobility patterns between women and men at a general level, are found in modal choice and travel distance. Womens practices tend to be related to the most sustainable means of transport, while mens practices are related to more un-sustainable transport. Relying on studies on transport planning including focus groups, interviews and workshops in Sweden, this paper ties the concepts of gender equality, to contemporary planning and sustainable smart mobility, and investigates in what way knowledge about gender equality is elaborated in regional planning practice. It appeared from the interviews that both gender equality and diversity were perceived as difficult in regional transport planning and that more knowledge and experience were needed. It was pointed out that there existed some knowledge but that there were no structures for how it could be incorporated into the planning process. Noticeable are conflicting practices, while policy on gender equality are attached to the planning there are still beliefs that transport planning can be gender neutral and free from social impacts. The smart mobility approach promises improvements of mobility and access opportunities for all.",

By detecting deviations and behavioral changes through long-term monitoring of daily life activities it is possible to identify physical or cognitive diseases. In this work, we first examine in detail the existing possibilities to recognize the activities of daily life and the capability of such a system to conclude from the given data on illnesses. Then we propose a model for the use of floor-based sensor technology to help diagnose diseases and behavioral changes by analyzing the time spent in bed as well as the walking speed of users.

It is often difficult for the indigenous people to receive consultation in the hospitals when they face any chronic disease. In Bangladesh, there are 54 groups of indigenous communities with a base of estimated 3 million in number. There are 300 government registered doctors and nurses, and 800 community health workers to provide health services to approximately 3 million people. By the invention of Information Technology, health care services have been modernized and more accessible in recent times. Information Technology has made the health services available at the door of general people. In recent years, there is large number of people in the indigenous community uses internet in their smart phones. As, there is not enough health care organizations and professional doctors in the indigenous community, for this reason, it will be useful and compatible to provide mobile phone-based services to the people. Mobile phone-based health services have great potentiality in reducing digital divide, and acts as a crucial tool for supporting indigenous community especially chronic disease affected people staying at home.

PCC is an ideal care principle, which monitors and understands individual circumstances, and plans and executes optimized care. Since the current systems individually manage different user contexts, reusing the contexts across multiple systems is quite different. In this paper, we propose a new service that uniformly manages the user context, and allows external applications to retrieve necessary user contexts efficiently. More specifically, the proposed service gathers heterogeneous data from different systems, and standardizes the data with a common database with domain-independent attributes of when, who, whom, where, what, how, and why. Using a practical use case, we show how the proposed service efficiently manages user contexts.",

This provides us with a challenging task of analysing the data thus collected which has an inherent uncertainty. In this study, we explore a symbolic data representation method for generation of features from the raw time series data collected by accelerometer sensors present in Android based phones. The experiments are carried out on a benchmark dataset for activity recognition. The data generated is validated for the activity recognition task using different individual classifiers and also ensemble classifiers.

Our driving ides is to take advantage of the knowledge that elderly can gather. For example, a tourist can go sightseeing in a new city by using an elders advice. When decisions are based on information collected from other individual, trust management is a key problem. Also in our case, we must deal with the problem of the freshness of the elders information and the trustworthiness of their knowledge.

Hence, in this study, we examined user diverse trust perceptions and evaluations in contextual comparison. An online questionnaire study was conducted (Nthinspace=thinspace129), focusing on trust in and the intention to use autonomous driving and smart home environments with regard to different user groups. Results reveal that trust was context sensitive: in particular gender and technical affinity influence users decision to (dis)trust autonomous technologies. Also, incentives for the usage differed depending on the context. Test environments were perceived as most important incentive for the context of autonomous driving, whereas users strongly appreciated energy efficiency referring to smart home. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of user needs towards the acceptance of autonomous technologies.",

		"abstract": "The aging population, prevalence of chronic diseases, and outbreaks of infectious diseases are some of the major healthcare challenges. To address these unmet healthcare challenges, monitoring and Activity Recognition (AR) are considered as a subtask in pervasive computing and context-aware systems. Innumerable interdisciplinary applications exist, underpinning the obtrusive sensory data using the revolutionary digital technologies for the acquisition, transformation, and fusion of recognized activities. However, little importance is given by the research community to make the use of non-wearables i.e. unobtrusive sensing technologies. The physical state of human pervasively in daily living for AR can be seamlessly presented by acquiring health-related information by using unobtrusive sensing technologies to enable long-term health monitoring without violating an individuals privacy. This paper aims to propose and provide supervised recognition of Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) by observing unobtrusive sensor events using statistical reasoning. Furthermore, it also investigates their semantic correlations by defining semantic constraints with the support of ontological reasoning. Extensive experiments were performed with real-world dataset shared by the University of Jaen Ambient Intelligence (UJAmI) Smart Lab in order to recognize the human activities in the smart environment. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the supervised method (87%) is comparable to the one, state of the art semantic approach (91%).",

A person with dementia should receive the counseling as often as possible. However, it is difficult for a limited number of caregivers to spare sufficient time and effort. This motivated us to exploit the virtual agent technology we are developing, for implementing daily dementia counseling system at home. However, our previous system relies on static dialogue scripts. Therefore, it is difficult to realize person-centered conversations that are essential to the dementia counseling. In this paper, we propose a method that dynamically generates personalized dialogues for individual people with dementia. The proposed method extensively uses life history and linked open data (LOD). More specifically, we obtain the life history of a user based on The Center Method, then the system choose appropriate conversation considering the history. During the conversation, the system finds new information in LOD relevant to the response and uses it to develop further conversation. We also implement a prototype to show practical feasibility of the proposed method.",

		"abstract": "In smart home applications, accurate sensor-based human activity recognition is based on learning patterns online from collections of sequential sensor events. A more challenging problem is to discover and learn unknown activities that have not been observed or predefined. This is because in a real-world environment, it is impractical to presume that users/residents will only accomplish a set of predefined activities over a long-term period. To address the issues of classifying sequential data where there are multiple sensor-based activities which might be overlapping, we propose an Online Hidden Condition Random Field (OHCRF) using Resilient Gradient Algorithm (RGA) to recognize human activity behaviors. The discriminative nature of our OHCRF models the sequential observations of an online stream, resolving the level of biased data and over-fitting. The proposed adaptive RGA approach is used to update OHCRFs parameters for online learning. Compared with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the proposed adaptive RGA converges faster, and has an efficient and transparent adaptation process. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art methods for sequential sensor-based activity recognition involving datasets acquired from residents in smart home test-beds.",

This paper motivates the need to step-wise reduce the complexity of sensor data to enable application domain experts to tailor and develop (parts of) applications without having in depth programming skills. To achieve this goal, a methodology for application development with real-time sensor data processing is presented. The methodology is based on the concepts of physical and logical sensors, which can detect atomic and composite events. The combination of using the declarative approach of Complex Event Processing and modularization allows processing most data in the event space instead of signal processing. A use case for a home care application demonstrates the strength of this methodology.",

		"abstract": "City traffic is getting more multi-modal, with a variety of actors and mobility options in mixed spaces. This makes decisions on traffic behaviour and control more complex. Beyond traditionally considered aspects (e.g. traffic state or used vehicle), human aspects (e.g. physical state, displacement goal, or companion), gain increasing relevance. They can greatly modify how people move and interact with others. Introducing social knowledge about human behaviour and context can help to better understand and anticipate the environment and its actions. This paper proposes the development of Social-Aware Driver Assistance Systems (SADASs) for that purpose. A SADAS uses traffic social properties that formalize social knowledge using a template organized around diagrams. The diagrams are compliant with a specific modelling language, which is intended to describe social aspects in a given context. They facilitate the integration of this knowledge with system specifications, and its semi-automated verification both in design and run time. A case study on a distributed obstacle detection system for vehicles extended with social knowledge to anticipate people behaviour illustrates the approach.",

As we look to new technologies to solve existing problems, we can consider Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to make construction safer and efficient. Through this paper, we explore the ways in which AI can assist in the goal of making construction sites safe. This study proposes the development of an AI platform, which improves construction safety through hazard identification at the pre-construction stage, and suggests the applicable OSHA codes for the identified hazards, thus allowing safety standards to be implemented for compliance. Emphasis is laid on the mitigation of fall hazards, which is the leading cause of accidents in construction. Currently, project safety and risk assessment in the construction industry is carried out by professionals, who heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision making. There is a lack of a systematic approach and the ways to check the reliability of these decisions. Through the machine learning aspect of AI, we can automate the process and create an environment where potential hazards are identified before they occur with a link to the OSHA standards for recommended mitigation strategies.",

The older population staying alone at home is prone to various accidental events including falls which may lead to multiple harmful consequences even death. Thus, it is imperative to develop a robust solution to avoid this problem. This can be done with the help of video surveillance along with computer vision. In this paper, a simple yet efficient technique to detect fall with the help of inexpensive depth camera was presented. Frame differencing method was applied for background subtraction. Various features including orientation angle, aspect ratio, silhouette features, and motion history image (MHI) were extracted for fall characterization. The training and testing were successfully implemented using SVM and SGD classifiers. It was observed that SGD classifier gives better fall detection accuracy than the SVM classifier in both training and testing phase for SDU fall dataset.",

The current system uses the 3D model based on an unreal character for the VA. Because the unfamiliar appearance is to be a mental obstacle to PWD, PWD hardly accept advice and which causes a limitation in the care effects. In this paper, we develop a novel system that dynamically creates a VA based on a given facial image of real person. The proposed system constructs a three-dimensional model based on facial landmarks within the image. It then stretches and transforms some portions of the 3D model to generate facial expressions. From just a given picture, the proposed system easily generates a communication agent familiar with individual PWD. Hence, it can implement (virtual, but effective) conversations with familiar partners. We implement the prototype based on the proposed system and conduct the experiment targeting to the elderly.",

		"abstract": "One of the effects of population ageing is the increase in the proportion of long-term chronic diseases, which require new therapeutical models that mostly take place at the patients home rather than inside a health care institution. This requires that patients autonomously follow their prescribed treatment, which can be especially difficult for patients suffering some kind of cognitive impairment. Information technologies show potential for supporting medication adherence but the main challenge is the distributed and highly regulated nature of this scenario, where there are several tasks involving the coordinated action of a range of actors. In this paper we propose to use socially intelligent systems to tackle this challenge. These systems exhibit, understand, and reason about social behaviour, in order to support people in their daily lives. Such systems present an opportunity when applied to information technologies for supporting treatment adherence. We explore how concepts of socially intelligent systems, including social practices and social identities, can be applied to AVICENA, an ongoing project to create a platform for assisting patients in several daily tasks related to their healthcare. We first introduce AVICENA, briefly describe our previous attempts to model the system from an organizational perspective and an institutional one and discuss some of the limitations found in those models. Then the core concepts of socially intelligent systems are introduced and we show how they can be applied to create a socially aware framework for supporting medication adherence.",

A low-cost system for continuous monitoring of EDA has been described, together with the experimental setup and the processing techniques applied. A unique indicator, which combines the features extracted from the raw waveform, has been discussed in the paper and applied in post-processing. The implementation of the processing algorithms and the computation of the novel indicator allow to discriminate, with a statistical significance, the user perception, in case of high emotion events (i.e., from low level Arousalthinspace<thinspace3 to high level one,thinspace>thinspace6).

Method: We conducted a two-stage exploratory case study in a student project at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Results: The results in stage 1 showed that S-Scrum helps to ensure safety of each release but is less agile than the normal Scrum. We explored six challenges on: priority management; communication; time pressure on determining safety requirements; safety planning; time to perform upfront planning; and safety requirements acceptance criteria. During stage 2, the safety and agility have been improved after the optimizations, including an internal and an external safety expert; pre-planning meeting; regular safety meeting; an agile safety plan; and improved safety epics and safety stories. We have also gained valuable suggestions from industry, but the generalization problem due to the specific context is still unsolved.",

		"abstract": "The availability of diverse embedded sensors in modern smartphones has created exciting opportunities for developing context-aware services and applications, such as Human activity recognition (HAR) in healthcare and smart buildings. However, recognizing human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data mining approaches due to the limited resources of the device. For example, the training process is usually performed offline but rarely online on the mobile device itself, because traditional batch learning usually needs a large dataset of many users. Therefore, building models using complex multiclass algorithms is generally very time-consuming. In this paper, we present a comparison study using two approaches in order to reduce training time and memory usage while maintaining significant performance. In the first approach, we conducted experiments using batch learning on a GPU platform. Results showed that High Performance Extreme Learning Machine (HPELM) offers the best compromise: accuracy, memory usage and training time. Moreover, it achieved better performance on two dynamic activities, outperforming the best SVM model obtained in our previous study. In the second approach, we conducted experiments using online stream learning on the MOA platform. Unlike the first approach, experiments were performed using accelerometer data only. We also studied the effects of user/device dependency and feature engineering on the classification performance and memory usage by comparing five constructed real data streams. Simulation results showed that Hoeffding Adaptive Tree has comparable performance to batch learning, especially for user and device dependent data streams.",

Such spaces are defined as a physical space rich in equipment and software services that is capable of interacting with people in order to provide intelligent services to the user for improved comfort (quality of life), energy saving, security, and tremendous benefits for an elderly person living alone. Providing intelligent services requires the equipment to be sensitive to the context of use or context-awareness. The concept of context is a key enabling factor in such environment and understand it, establishing its components and modeling it are basic and important steps for the development of smart spaces. Previous works in such environments were unable to deal efficiently with context-awareness. In this paper we present both an ontology-based context modeling approach and context reasoning for a smart living room.",

Online healthcare communities (OHCs) are interesting in this regard, appearing to serve as virtual communities for people to provide social support. However, the development of OHCs requires the active participation of its members to create and share knowledge. How to improve community members provision of social support becomes a key issue for community managers. To address this issue, utilizing social exchange theory, we propose a benefit-cost model to study the incentive factors and inhibiting factors of the social support in OHCs. In the model, the benefits are extended to the psychological rewards in social exchange, including sense of belongings, reputation and sense of self-worth. Costs are divided into cognitive costs and executional costs. We study the moderation effect of psychological distance. Data will be collected from more than 300 users of well-known OHCs in China and analyzed by SmartPLS. The research findings can provide managerial implications for community managers.",

Among the target groups of people, elderly are a population eager for choices for living arrangements, which would allow them to continue living in their homes but at the same time provide the health care they need. Given the growing elderly population, there is a need for statistical models able to capture the recurring patterns of daily activity life and reason based on this information. We present an analysis of real-life sensor data collected from 40 different households of elderly people, using motion, door and pressure sensors. Our objective is to automatically observe and model the daily behavior of the elderly and detect anomalies that could occur in the sensor data. For this purpose, we first introduce an abstraction layer to create a common ground for home sensor configurations. Next, we build a probabilistic spatio-temporal model to summarize daily behavior. Anomalies are then defined as significant changes from the learned behavioral model and detected using a cross-entropy measure. We have compared the detected anomalies with manually collected annotations and the results show that the presented approach is able to detect significant behavioral changes of the elderly.",

Sleep quality is essential for the human being to maintain good physical and emotional health. And sleep disorders can lead to severe physical and emotional effects, e.g. cognitive decline and mental health complications. So being able to measure and evaluate sleep quality and monitor mood is inseparably linked to every assistive living system.

The algorithmic approaches, under evaluation and comparison, belong to the three main categories of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques. At this purpose, specific synthetic data are generated, including activities of daily living, home locations in which such activities take place, as well as physiological parameters. All techniques are evaluated in terms of abnormality-detection accuracy and lead-time of prediction, using the generated datasets with various kinds of perturbation. The achieved results, even though preliminary, are very encouraging, showing that unsupervised deep-learning techniques outperform traditional (machine learning) ones, with detection accuracy greater than 96% and prediction lead-time of about 15 days in advance.",

The analysis reveals that even the highest rating hospitals do not excel on all dimensions of satisfaction. While satisfaction levels with nurse and doctor communication are high, satisfaction levels with discharge information and explanation of medications could be significantly improved. In addition, low rating hospitals seem to be doing better than the high rating hospitals on these critical dimensions for the quality of care. The paper also investigates how hospital structural characteristics captured in the American Hospital Association (AHA) survey affect different dimensions of patient satisfaction. The analysis reveals that these structural factors may have differential effects, i.e. the type of hospitals (e.g., teaching vs. non-teaching) has a relatively small effect on the hospital room environment than on communication and responsiveness. The results suggest that considering all patient satisfaction dimensions helps provide a more accurate picture of the care received by patients, makes it possible to pinpoint specific areas where hospitals are deficient that are not reflected in the overall satisfaction scores, and assists hospital management to design actionable strategies for improvement.",

		"abstract": "Based on GPS/Beidou technologies, dynamic safety supervision of commercial operating vehicles has played an important role in transportation industry safety. From the serious traffic accidents occurred in recent years, the major reasons were the improper safety supervision of vehicles. The traditional dynamic safety supervision mode and applications are insufficient. To make up for the lack of traditional dynamic supervision and realize the traceability and visualization of the supervision process, it is necessary to innovate the road transportation safety monitoring, with new management concepts and technologies. Based on the practical understanding of the traditional monitoring status of the industry, this paper proposes the third-party safety supervision of commercial vehicles. We successfully incorporate the application of third parties in other fields world widely and combine it with the development of vehicle dynamic monitoring technology. Through the innovative application of empirical applications in certain areas, the government bureau, enterprises, and monitoring operators all recognized the new model. The overall safety level indicators and accident data before and after the application are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the new model has largely improved the safety level of transportation within the region. At the same time, it has broadened the scale of supervision, practically reducing the corporate costs and operating investment. The new model greatly improves the dynamic security monitoring effect, which satisfies all parties demands without increasing the input. At present, this model has been promoted and applied in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was proved to have important social and economic significance for modern transportation industries.",

In this paper, we present our approach for creating highly realistic simulation and visualization of activities of daily living (ADL) in smart homes within our Persim 3D simulator. We design and compile a set of ADLs into Persim3D activity library.

We evaluate Persim 3Ds simulation fidelity through use study, by gauging users perception of the realism of activity visualization.",

To design App graphic interface, a total of three pages were designed to let user answer the questions and show the results of their level or risk to have T2DM. We validated the feasibility of our App in 100 users and the results were promising. Therefore, the personalized EBM diabetes risk factor calculator might be a feasible approach to remind those T2DM risky populations by revealing their potential risk factors, thus making implementation of personalized and prevention medicine achievable at hand.",

Events in smart home environments are recorded at the level of sensor triggers, which is too low to mine habit-related behavioral patterns. Process discovery algorithms produce then overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework to automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level. Our framework is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. We use supervised learning techniques to train it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction improve on precision as well as on F-score.",

		"abstract": "Ensuring ethical value exchange is moving to the forefront of the global challenges that HCI will have to address in the coming years. In this position paper, we argue that applying a context-sensitive, sociotechnical approach to HCI can help meet the challenge. The background is that the life of marginalized people in contemporary society is challenging and uncertain. The marginalized can face health and cognitive issues as well as a lack of stability of social structures such as family, work and social inclusion. Three questions are of concern when innovating together with people at the margins: how can we describe users without attempting to stereotype badly, what sociotechnical HCI methods fit the local societal context, and how to make the design sustainable in face of current planetary challenges (e.g., climate change)? We adapt the sociotechnical HCI approach called human work interaction design (HWID) to meet the challenges of designing for ethical value exchange. We present three cases of service design, and suggest how to add a fourth similar case using the HWID approach during a field trip and workshop at the INTERACT 2017 conference in Mumbai. We conclude that applying a context sensitive sociotechnical HCI framework implies that both the backend and frontend of service design and product innovations should be executed and valorized from within the local context.",

Accelerometers are increasingly used to monitor human activities of daily living in different contexts such as monitoring activities of persons with cognitive deficits in smart homes, and monitoring physical and fitness activities. Activity recognition is the most important core component in monitoring applications. Activity recognition algorithms require substantial amount of labeled data to produce satisfactory results under diverse circumstances. Several methods have been proposed for activity recognition from accelerometer data. However, very little work has been done on identifying connections and relationships between existing labeled datasets to perform transfer learning for new datasets. In this paper, we investigate deep learning based transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that takes advantage of learned representations of activities of daily living from one dataset to recognize these activities in different other datasets characterized by different features including sensor modality, sampling rate, activity duration and environment. We experimentally validated our proposed algorithm on several existing datasets and demonstrated its performance and suitability for activity recognition.",

The experimental data is based on the simulated fall videos took from Leqiao station of Soochow 1st metro line in Jiangsu province. Our results show that, the single picture and video are tested respectively, and it is found that the timing information is more fault-tolerant and more accurate in identifying falls, yet is more complex and more difficult to implement. Whats more, because of the lack of sufficient fall videos, the results analysis based on the proposed algorithm remains much room for improvements.

Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory. It proposes the use of the Integrated Behavior Model as a theoretical framework for understanding behavioral determinants and explores the use of games as a way of fostering changes in attitudes that could enhance intergenerational interactions.",

Based on the theory of embodied interaction and disembodied interaction in cognitive science, this paper combines field research and user in-depth interviews, usability testing, SWOT analysis, SPSS questionnaire analysis, high-fidelity prototype construction, usability testing and other research data to study the interaction grammar of embodied interaction and disembodied interaction. By designing the prototype of the robot, three typical Chinese families are selected to conduct prototype tests of embodied interaction and disembodied interaction. Then on this basis, affordance, Interactive Behavior, Interactive Feedforward of embodied interaction and Mapping Relations of Symbols, Semantics and Interactive Feedback of disembodied interaction and understanding of the construction of interactive grammar are established. This study has a certain effect on embodied interaction and disembodied interaction between human and computer interaction.",

		"abstract": "Product personalisation has become a central topic and expected part of every day life. Different people have different characteristics and abilities and each user has different needs which means that products have to be tailored accordingly. Microwave ovens are one of the most commonly used home appliances. People use them to quickly heat or cook certain foods. Today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 90% of U.S. households own a microwave oven. This project seeks to enable people with intellectual disabilities and physical impairments to perform simple cooking tasks. The target group includes ageing people who experience difficulties in using microwave systems, with a particularly low grade of autonomy in preparing foods and meals. In order to address the specific needs of the defined group of users, the research follows the principles of the Quality Function Deployment analysis and takes inspiration from the DfA (Design for All) theories and the UCD (User Centred Design) method. The aim of the research is to find new solutions in order to simplify certain activities of daily living for users who would otherwise be excluded from these actions. In the second stage, the project, seeks to provide a set of tools that enable the interaction with smart appliances to grow the sense of community, by sharing information within a social network and a Cloud-based service system. The main challenge is to create a Community Supported Appliance that provides technology and settings for enabling users in performing one daily activity. The CSA is intended to be a simple to use, affordable learning system, continuously fed from the community of carers and service users, that has the potential to be used, in the near future, by a wider group of people. A device of this type benefits from added value given from expert users to others in the community, in the form of sequenced multimedia instructions to the person and direct operating instructions to the appliance.",

The improvements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) have resulted in the development of equipment that supports ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and intelligent user interfaces. The smart home technologies, assisted robotics, sensors for health monitoring and e-health solutions are some examples in this category. Despite such growth in these individualized technologies, there are only few solutions that provide integrated AAL frameworks that interconnect all of these technologies. In this paper, we discuss the necessity to opt for an integrated solution in AAL. To support the study we describe real life scenarios that help us justify the need for integrated solutions over individualized ones. Our analysis points to the clear conclusion that an integrated solution for AAL outperforms the individualized ones.",

In fact, this is our second attempt to achieve that. Although tailored for smart homes, this virtual butler could be applied to other types of smart spaces and environments, such as shopping malls, airports, industry, etc. The developed virtual butler is able to interact with users by voice and it is sensitive to user location (and other context information).",

As AAL technologies have an enormous potential to support care staff as well as caretakers in professional care situations, it is questionable to what extent professional care staff accepts and adopts to use assisting technologies in their professional everyday life. In more detail, it is of major interest to analyze how care professionals perceive potential benefits and barriers of AAL technology usage, specific characteristics of data gathering and storage as well as if individual user factors of care professionals influence the perception and acceptance of AAL technologies.",

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments can help the elderly and people with functional diversity by anticipating their needs in specific situations and acting proactively in order to properly assist them in performing their activities of daily living (ADLs). Since the users needs tend to be very diverse in regard to functioning and disability levels, it is crucial to have personalized services capable of providing tailored assistance to a user based on their unique preferences, requirements, and desires. This paper introduces the ontology named AATUM (Ambient Assistive Technology User Model), to be adopted by systems whose goal is to enhance user quality of life within ALL environments through service personalization. Its main feature is the use of The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to model the users functioning and disability levels in a consistent and internationally comparable way. The use of the proposed ontology is illustrated through its application in two different case studies.",

Since the current systems individually manage the user context, reusing the contexts across multiple systems is quite different. In this paper, we propose a new service that uniformly manages the user context, and allows external applications to retrieve necessary user contexts efficiently. More specifically, the proposed service gathers heterogeneous data from different systems, and standardizes the data with a common database with general attributes of when, who, whom, where, what, how, and why. Using a practical use case, we show how the proposed service efficiently manages user contexts.",

Due to privacy constraints, such personal data often cannot be uploaded to external servers, hence the classification and personalization has to run on the client device. We use a server to train our model to classify calendar events using SVM and fastText, while the prediction is run on the client device using the trained model. The class labels from the classified calendar events, weighted in order of recency, are used to build a vector, which we treat as a representation of user interest while personalizing the recommendations. This vector is used to re-rank health related recommendations obtained from third party providers based on relevance. We describe the implementation details of our system and some tests on its accuracy and relevance to provide relevant health related recommendations. While we used the calendar app to classify events, our system can also be extended for other apps such as messaging.",

Currently, most AD solutions only focus on detecting anomalies in the user daily activities while omitting the ones from the environment itself. For instance the user may have forgotten the pan on the stove while he/she is phoning. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting anomaly occurring in the home environment during user activities: CAREDAS.

In fact, thanks to reasoning processes these technologies can be used as part of decision-support systems in a variety of domains. In this paper two examples of ontologies are presented.

Such environments, which include smart homes, hospitals, campuses, etc., are oriented towards human comfort and safety. Detecting the presence of a human being in spaces within such environment forms a major challenge. Though there are sensors that can perform this task, they are not without limitations. Using information derived from either single or multiple sensors separately is not sufficient to distinguish human beings from other objects within the environment. Reliable detection of human presence can be achieved only by fusing information obtained from multiple sensors. In this paper, we describe an approach to human presence detection using a combination of PIR and ultrasonic sensors. Analysis is performed based on the received raw signals from the PIR as well as an analog ultrasonic sensor. A voting based approach has been used to classify signals obtained from human beings and non-human objects, thereby facilitating human presence detection. Results obtained from indoor experiments performed using this approach substantiate the viability of its use in real environments.",

However, we lack knowledge on how to classify chatbots and how such classification can be brought to bear in analysis of chatbot interaction design. In this workshop paper, we propose a typology of chatbots to support such classification and analysis. The typology dimensions address key characteristics that differentiate current chatbots: the duration of the users relation with the chatbot (short-term and long-term), and the locus of control for users interaction with the chatbot (user-driven and chatbot-driven). To explore the usefulness of the typology, we present four example chatbot purposes for which the typology may support analysis of high-level chatbot interaction design. Furthermore, we analyse a sample of 57 chatbots according to the typology dimensions. The relevance and application of the typology for developers and service providers are discussed.",

Developing assistive technologies such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems pose a potential approach to face these challenges by relieving care staff or facilitating everyday life, e.g., for people with disabilities. Thereby, acceptance is essential for a sustainable adoption of assistive technologies in real life. So far, research has focused on technology-related as well as demographic factors and persons attitudes (e.g., technical self-efficacy) impacting technology acceptance. In contrast, individual attitudes towards the own situation - in particular individual attitudes towards care -- have not been considered as potential influencing factors on the acceptance of assistive technologies. In order to create an appropriate measuring instrument for attitudes towards care, two empirical studies were carried out: In an online survey study (n = 34) persons attitudes towards the own care situation and their relationships to attitudes towards usage of assistive technologies were studied out of the perspective of people with disabilities. The exploratory confirmed instrument attitudes towards care was related with acceptance and perception of assistive technologies focusing on people of different ages with physical disabilities. Results of the second study (n = 64) verified these relationships focusing on elderly people in need of care. This suggests that attitudes towards care are acceptance-relevant for diverse groups of people. The results can be used to investigate relationships between individual perceptions of care and (assistive) technology acceptance in detail and to refine and adapt the attitude towards care instrument for diverse user groups.",

To this end we propose a method for decision support on user-centered arrangements of public services. The method is a planning and evaluation tool based on feature modelling. It makes it possible to describe services from the user perspective and compare them in terms of their advantageous arrangement in a facility building.

This article describes the design and early development of a software tool, that allows to control an AAL System, completely based on an ontological approach. From this innovative point of view, an ontological formalization is used to describe a domain and to implement an automatic reason. This approach provides a dynamic model that can change its state and expand accordingly to rules that are also a part of the model. Such a description is continually updated with information provided by the AAL System database that reports the significant events recorded by the sensors. Then, exploiting the potential of an OWL-DL reasoner, decisions about the feedbacks that the System have to activate, are inferred.",

Dem@Care is an European research project that conducted a study for timely diagnosis of Alzheimers disease by collecting everyday motion data from couples (or dyads), with one of the person in the couple having AD. Their results suggest that AD can be detected using everyday motion data from accelerometers. They did evaluation based on leave-one-person-out cross-validation. However, this evaluation can introduce bias in the classification results because one of the person from the dyad is present in the training set while the other is being tested. In this paper, we revisit the Dem@Care study and propose a new evaluation method that performs leave one-dyad-out cross-validation to remove the dataset selection bias. We then introduce new domain specific features based on dynamic and static intervals of motions that significantly improves the classification results. We further show increase in performance by combining the proposed features with new time, frequency domain and baseline features used in the Dem@Care study.",

Using only the depth maps from the sensor, the system can work in poor light conditions and guarantees the privacy of the person. The neural network is trained with a dataset produced with the Kinect tracker, but it is also tested with a different human tracker (NiTE). In particular, the aim of this work is to analyse the behaviour of the neural network even when the position of the extracted joints is not reliable and the provided skeleton is confused. Real-time tests have been carried out covering the whole operative range of the sensor (up to 3.5 m). Experimental results have shown an overall accuracy of 98.3% using the NiTE tracker for the falling tests, with the worst accuracy of 97.5%.",

		"abstract": "The aging process typically requires personalized care services for each individual. In this context, a collaborative elderly care ecosystem can support the provision of integrated services that may combine contributions from multiple providers. Through composition of services a personalized solution, tailored to the individual customer, respecting her/his requests, preferences, lifestyle, and constraints, can be achieved. An additional issue the ecosystem must deal with is the problem of evolution, as individuals care needs are not static over time. Consequently, the care services need to evolve accordingly to keep the elderlys requirements satisfied. This process of services adaptation is challenging since many services can be dependent on each other, and there are various constraints that need to be observed before adaptating and enacting new services. In this paper, we exploit socio-technical aspects of service adaptation in the context of elderly care ecosystems. Starting with a service personalization method previously proposed, we introduce various cases of evolution of elderly care services in response to new requirements. The method considers customers inputs and suggests evolution plans based on the MAPE-K methodology. An application example is then introduced to illustrate the approach.",

In a network with even distribution of nodes, nodes that lie near the base station deplete their energy faster and hole is created which leads to disconnected network. Incorporating Heterogeneity in the network increases energy efficiency and improves network lifetime. Heterogeneity is included in terms of energy, links and computational resources.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a Wi-Fi based behavior recognition algorithm through the wall. Firstly, the Wi-Fi signal distribution is analyzed according to the Wi-Fi signal model. Then, according to the distribution characteristics of different Wi-Fi signals, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is used to reconstruct the signal to complete the de-nosing processing of the Wi-Fi signal. Finally, feature extraction and feature classification in the time-frequency domain is performed to complete the human behavior recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher recognition accuracy in terms of walking and running than the traditional Wi-Fi based indoor recognition algorithms.",

		"abstract": "Post-war neighborhoods all over Europe are facing various kinds of challenges in order to adapt them for use in the future. The predominant factor in many concepts of neighborhood refurbishment is the energy demand of the buildings. In connection, many research projects focus on the reduction of CO2 emissions, omitting the fact that this specific value does not have any immediate benefit for the residents themselves, neither on the psychological nor on the economic level. The sole positive effects can be found on the macroeconomic level, which rarely is calculated and most likely cannot be communicated as a benefit to the residents in a comprehensible fashion. This approach may lead to considerable resistance among the residents against ambitious redevelopment plans. The methodological approach presented in this paper reflects the establishment of a vision for a neighborhood-development strategy. Its core is an iterative process using the tools of questionnaires, workshops and focus-group discussions, which involves the owners of the buildings, the local energy provider, policy makers, representation of the residents and research experts. The methodological framework was developed based on the reference neighborhood Itzling, which is situated in the city of Salzburg/Austria. It is an urban area with mostly social housing erected between 1966 and 1976, which houses approximately 2500 inhabitants. The singular priorities of this neighborhoods refurbishment plans were harmonized in the form of a questionnaire and multiple workshops. As a result of this process, five key areas of action (energy, living space, open space, social and mobility) were identified. The developed iterative process is multipliable and transferrable to comparable urban areas that share a set of similarities. It is the basis for future decisions and gives orientation to the building owners, the energy provider and policy makers. Besides the methodology, the outcomes of this process are a poster, a folder and a detailed catalog of measures. The poster and the folder visualize the neighborhood development strategy. A set of characters, icons and photos including easily comprehensible comics was developed. These design features are important in order to create a recognition value and to stimulate acceptance among the inhabitants of the neighborhood. Moreover, the low-threshold approach of the design facilitates future communication with the concerned public. The described methodology of the neighborhood-development strategy guarantees the inclusion of all stakeholders and supports a prioritization of future measures that can lead to a more energy-efficient and livable development of neighborhoods in need of adaptation.",

Failing is problematic as it is unpleasant for the user and may cause critical situations. Therefore, understanding and preventing failures is a challenging need. In this paper, we propose LEAF, an experience based approach to prevent task failure. LEAF relies on both semantic context knowledge through ontology and user validation, allowing LEAF to have an accurate understanding of failures. It then uses this new knowledge to adapt a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) in order to prevent selecting tasks that have a high risk of failure in the plan. LEAF was tested in the Hadaptic platform and evaluated using a randomly generated dataset.",

We extract joint angles from multiple body joints changing in time and create a spatiotemporal feature matrix (i.e., multiple body joint angles in time). With these derived features, we train and test our CNN for HAR. In order to evaluate our system, we have compared the performance of our CNN-based HAR against the HMM- and Deep Belief Network (DBN)-based HAR using a database of Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Our test results show that the proposed CNN-based HAR is able to recognize twelve human activities reliably and it outperforms the HMM- and DBN-based systems. We have achieved the average recognition accuracy of 98.59% for the activities. The results are 6.1% more accurate than that of the HMM-based HAR and 1.05% more accurate than that of the DBN-based HAR.",

The paper dwells on an experimental assessment of the system. Linear regression analysis have been carried out in order to assess the influence of system performance---in terms of dialogue efficiency metrics and dialogue quality metrics---on the perceived satisfaction of users. Results show that longer dialogues are preferred in order to positively influence the users satisfaction, suggesting the importance for people to have time for getting confident with new ICT solutions. Moreover, from the experimental analysis, it clearly emerges how system intervention should be reduced, suggesting how a good balance between user and system turns represents an important aspect for a fluid interaction. The same can be speculated for dialogues with no met requests that also tended to be associated with lower satisfaction scores. These last results support the importance for a vocal assistant to be effective in its purpose in order to be perceived as useful and satisfying.",

Especially for emergency situations, when the app has concluded the presence of several threatening health or security hazards. Such situations require an effective, joint handling of all acute health and security hazards in one combined dialogue. Otherwise, the domain specific knowledge for concluding present hazards has been isolated deliberately into separate units for efficient maintenance and comprehensibility. It is represented in a declarative way by finite state machines. A multitude of such finite state machines will be executed simultaneously in the app for monitoring all relevant potential health and/or security hazards. Furthermore, the tactical knowledge for dialogue handling of concluded hazards is represented independently from the domain specific knowledge by critical dialogue sections, CDSs. A CDS has an internal activity structure for controlling the dialogue with the smartwatch wearer in order the handle the concluded hazard. During the execution of a CDS, the smartwatch I/O and communication devices are exclusively attached to the CDS. Effective handling of such concluded hazards does typically include to establish a speech connection with distant family members or a home emergency call center. This can be achieved via the integrated cellular phone of the smartwatch. The selection of the situationally most appropriate hazard for handling is done via a central scheduler utilizing a blackboard. Our application framework relieves the software developer from dealing with the details and obstacles of effective dialogue implementation and allows to focus on the domain specific knowledge and handling logic of the assistance app.",

However, the dispersion of values of run sensors imposes negative effect on activity recognition. In this paper, an approach based on value revision is proposed to recognize the activities of a resident. First, the time and the total duration that each sensor is run are calculated as sensor attributes in an activity record. Second, the start time, end time and duration of an activity record are extracted from a set of activity records as activity attributes. Third, the information gains of attributes are calculated to filter attributes which have low the information gains. Fourth, values of attributes of tested activity records are replaced with the most similar values of attributes of activity records of training dataset. Finally, classifiers are exploited to recognize daily activities. This paper validates the recognition of daily activities in two datasets by comparing the proposed approach and a previous approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach favourably outperforms previous approach.",

		"abstract": "The residential sector accounts for approximately 27 and 17% of the world energy consumption and its CO2 emission, respectively. Thus, developing measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in this sector, which is highly associated with the rapidly increasing proportion of worlds urban population, is crucial to ensuring the sustainable development of the urban environment. However, the majority of the existing expertise on energy sustainability revolves around improving the thermal quality of the building envelop with lesser focus on the social and behavioural aspects of energy consumption. Given the importance of factors pertaining to the latter aspects, which are found to be responsible for 4--30% of the variation in residential energy consumption, this paper aims to address and explore for the first time the impact of the UK residents life-cycle evolution on their energy usage. To attain this, an official database encompassing around 5000 households observed over the course of 10 years was analysed with the help of specific statistical tests and procedures (e.g. logistic regression). First, logistic regression was employed to determine the socio-economic factors influencing households evolution from one state to another; consequently, future evolutionary models covering a 10-year window, were predicted. This was followed by analysing the effect of the predicted evolutionary models on the households gas and electricity usage patterns using point-biserial correlation. Finally, the findings suggest that households evolution have a significant effect on their energy consumption patterns. However, the magnitude and the direction of this effect is weak and mostly positive, respectively.",

Through this assistive platform, time and vicinity based pre-recorded instructions by the caregiver on how to employ certain home appliances are played out upon detection of the patients presence in the vicinity of the appliances. A log of the time and the kind of patients activity is reported back to the caregiver for their reference. In addition, the system will be used to monitor and track the location of the patient which can be used by the caregiver for assessment purposes. Upon completion, this project will significantly reduce the cost associated with assisted living, as it will replace numerous expensive devices on the market and drastically improve the quality of life for both the caregivers and the patients suffering from Dementia internationally.",

		"abstract": "In order to be accepted by users, one of the most important requirement for any assisted living technology is unobtrusiveness. This is particularly true when this technology is intended for continuous monitoring of vital signs, since traditional approaches require the subject to be tethered to measurement devices. The radar sensing is a very promising technology, enabling the measurement of vital signs at a distance, and thus meeting both requirements of unobtrusiveness and accuracy. In particular, impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar has attracted considerable attention in recent years thanks to many properties that make it useful for assisted living purposes. The aim of this paper is to investigate such radar technology for vital signs monitoring in assisted living scenarios. An algorithmic framework for the detection of respiration and heart rates during various activities of daily living is presented, including a method for compensation of movements of both the monitored subject and a second person present in the same environment (e.g., family member, caregiver, etc.). Experiments are carried out in various conditions that can be frequently encountered in assisted living scenarios. The reported results show that vital signs can be detected also while carrying out ADLs, with accuracy varying according to the level of movements and kind of involved bodys parts and postures.",

In order to expand the observation area the depth sensor has been mounted on a pan-tilt motorized head. If the person acceleration is above a preset threshold the system uses a lying pose detector as well as examines a dynamic feature to authenticate the fall. Thus, more costly fall authentication is not executed frame-by-frame, but instead we fetch from a circular buffer a sequence of depth maps acquired prior to the fall and then process them to confirm fall alert. We show that promising results in terms of sensitivity and specificity can be obtained on publicly available UR Fall Detection dataset.",

We discuss six psychological superpowers of robots rooted in their thingness rather than humanness. Robots are void of competitiveness, have endless patience, can be unconditionally subordinated, have the ability to contain themselves, do not take things personally and can assume responsibility. These qualities all relate to everyday companionship, but may be difficult to actually realize for fellow humans. By exploiting these superpowers, robot companions can become meaningful -- not as a substitute for other humans, but as a novel, complementary form of social interaction.",

This method was applied to location information gathered between August 1 and 31 in 2015. This research finds that KDE can serve as a visualization method to promote awareness.",

In this paper, leveraging the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) in commodity WiFi devices, we design and implement an adaptive and robust human intrusion detection system, called AR-Alarm. By utilizing a robust feature and self-adaptive learning mechanism, AR-Alarm achieves real-time intrusion detection in different environments without calibration efforts. To further increase the system robustness, we propose a few novel methods to distinguish real human intrusion from object motion in daily life such as object dropping, curtain swinging and pets moving. As demonstrated in the experiments, AR-Alarm achieves a high detection rate and low false alarm rate.",

In this paper, we present a comparison study for HAR using features selection methods to reduce the training and classification time while maintaining significant performance. In fact, due to the limited resources of Smartphones, reducing the feature set helps reducing computation costs, especially for real-time continuous online applications. We validated our approach on a publicly available dataset to classify six different activities.

Its high utilization rate in domestic environments opens a series of possibilities to meet the most varied needs of its viewers. In this context, projects developed for specific audiences can take advantage of the opportunities offered by TV. +TV4E is a solution designed for the elderly, which aims to provide their inclusion by displaying informative contents on topics of their interest. Applications such as this are very relevant because they directly affect a considerable portion of the worlds population. However, many of the features available in applications such as the +TV4E are inaccessible to people with physical disabilities since the main features available must be accessed through conventional remotes. New forms of interaction, based on the principles of Assistive Technology (AT), aim to enable people with physical disabilities to perform daily tasks in a more autonomous way. An example of an AT-based initiative is the IOM (Mouse-Eye Interface) project, which focuses on developing a device that functions as an alternative form of computer interaction, designed for people with motor disabilities in the upper limbs. In this context, this paper introduces IOM4TV, a software prototype that allows its users to control the +TV4E application through the IOM device. The article presents the proposed architecture, highlighting the main steps involved during the development of the solution. The paper also highlights the results obtained with the first round of prototype testing using two evaluation tools: SAM and AttrakDiff.",

Therefore, we propose a system that makes it possible to redesign work plans and support improvement activity by simply inputting values in accustomed standardized work tables, namely, process capacity tables, standardized work tables, and standardized work combination tables, of three types of workers, instead of inputting a large quantity of complicated parameters. Less examination time is desirable at production sites, and we added a tool that enabled the graphical display of execution processes and results. Moreover, we added a system that made it possible to alter Microsoft Excel database inputs, such as the number or arrangement of DM processing machines.

		"abstract": "Human Activity Recognition has been primarily investigated as a machine learning classification task forcing it to handle with two main limitations. First, it must assume that the testing data has an equal distribution with the training sample. However, the inherent structure of an activity recognition systems is fertile in distribution changes over time, for instance, a specific person can perform physical activities differently from others, and even sensors are prone to misfunction. Secondly, to model the pattern of activities carried out by each user, a significant amount of data is needed. This is impractical especially in the actual era of Big Data with effortless access to public repositories. In order to deal with these problems, this paper investigates the use of Transfer Learning, specifically Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, within human activity recognition systems. The yielded experiment results reveal a useful transfer of knowledge and more importantly the convenience of transfer learning within human activity recognition. Apart from the delineated experiments, our work also contributes to the field of transfer learning in general through an exhaustive survey on transfer learning for human activity recognition based on wearables.",

The above mentioned modelling was reflected in the construction of this optimized system as the design employs a single accelerometer and extracts only 7 time-domain features resulting in ease of computation to classify the activities, thus encouraging it to be inherently deployable on an embedded platform. The system was trained and tested on the accelerometer data acquired from three publicly available datasets. The performance of four chosen machine learning based classification models from an initial set of eight was evaluated, analysed and ranked on the grounds of efficiency and computation. The model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero (USD 5) and the average time for feature computation and the maximum time taken to classify an instance of an activity was found to be 0.015 s and 1.094 s respectively, thus validating the viability of the system on an embedded platform and making it affordable to the population in the low-income groups.",

So we note that an intelligent lighting which varies with the users need remains important source of economy of the energy. The intelligent lighting is obtained by using ambient intelligence (AmI). Multi agent System (MAS) have become the important paradigm to develop an ambient system because they have important characteristics like autonomy, proactivity and mobility to respond better to the main characteristic of ambient intelligence like the adaptability to the context.

Then, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory cells (LSTM) is used to recognize the activities associated with these features. To make the approach person-independent, different subjects from different camera angles are used. The proposed method shows promising performance, with the best result reaching an overall accuracy of 92.4% on a publicly available activity data set, which outperforms the conventional approaches (i.e. support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests) which achieve maximum accuracy of 78.5%.

		"abstract": "Integration of various sensors into observation systems is complicated due to the increase in the number of sensor manufacturers and the various protocols associated with them. In order to address the complexity, the used infrastructure must be interoperable and independent of underlying platform and must consider sensor observations in a uniform manner. This paper focuses on adapting a RESTful architecture for OGCs SWE services. This is done in order to overcome the limitations of SWE. The major limitations are associated with the architecture design and data format and this paper addresses these issues by implementing the different SWE services using RESTful architecture. The reason for this proposal is the fact that sensor nodes can be observed as RESFful resources and they are made attainable through SWE services and can be queried over SWE services. Another reasonable fact behind this proposal is that JSON data format which is lightweight can be used instead of XML in order to exchange messages; which can be a better extension for SWE. The performance analysis shows the advantage of using JSON notation instead of XML in terms of file size reduction.",

First, the grid map is divided into several unit regions using Boustrophedon cellular decomposition. Then, a unit region planning method based on a genetic algorithm is applied to generate a region transition sequence, and an effective strategy to search every region is adjusted according to the robots sensors. Meanwhile, the optimal path between two points is generated by an improved A* algorithm, so that the path is much shorter and the number of turns is greatly reduced. Finally, the simulation results verify that this method can provide an optimized path in known home environments effectively, based on that the robot can find human in the shortest possible time.",

These technological advances, the increase of literacy in health and also in informatics placed the smartphone and its massive use in the center of a new paradigm of monitoring physical activity. When combining these functionalities with the ability to communicate with remote entities, then it is possible to expand the use of smartphones, not only to monitoring physical activity but also to promote widespread adherence to physical activity programs. This paper presents the conceptual framework of a global health community program centered on a mobile application and a dedicated backoffice web application to perform physical activity prescription and supervision based on dashboards. The MOVIDA platform is comprised of 4 main modules, targeting different groups of the population. This platform enables exercise prescription, monitoring of users performance and adherence in metabolic diseases patients by MOVIDA.cronos, to specify and follow a cardiac rehabilitation program by MOVIDA.eros, to track and quantify indoor movements by MOVIDA.domus, and also access to a stratified training circuit, for maintaining or improve fitness level by MOVIDA.polis. In addition, this work reports the project main challenges from the conceptual phase of the technological platform to its development and implementation. This work can be useful for those who are starting a project with the same type of characteristics: multicentric, interdisciplinary and involving several partners in the community.",

		"abstract": "Assessing facial dynamics in patients with major neurocognitive disorders and specifically with Alzheimers disease (AD) has shown to be highly challenging. Classically such assessment is performed by clinical staff, evaluating verbal and non-verbal language of AD-patients, since they have lost a substantial amount of their cognitive capacity, and hence communication ability. In addition, patients need to communicate important messages, such as discomfort or pain. Automated methods would support the current healthcare system by allowing for telemedicine, i.e., lesser costly and logistically inconvenient examination. In this work we compare methods for assessing facial dynamics such as talking, singing, neutral and smiling in AD-patients, captured during music mnemotherapy sessions. Specifically, we compare 3D ConvNets, Very Deep Neural Network based Two-Stream ConvNets, as well as Improved Dense Trajectories. We have adapted these methods from prominent action recognition methods and our promising results suggest that the methods generalize well to the context of facial dynamics. The Two-Stream ConvNets in combination with ResNet-152 obtains the best performance on our dataset, capturing well even minor facial dynamics and has thus sparked high interest in the medical community.",

Three key elements of the proposed framework (rehabilitation module, workspace and rehabilitation scenarios) have been described in detail. In the rehabilitation sessions, the users and the robot are asked to work together to place cubes so as to form a predefined shape. The robot and the user hold the same object in order to move it to a particular destination according to a rehabilitation scenario. If the robot detects a force from the user directed in the wrong direction during the navigation then it resists and corrects the movement in order to assist the user towards the right direction. The assistive support scenarios were designed to evaluate the achieved enhancement of precision, efficiency and dexterity of arm movements. The proposed rehabilitation framework provides a modular, automated and open-source platform for researchers and practitioners in neuromuscular rehabilitation applications.",

The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with perfect performance in speech recognition has a good effect on HAR. However, almost all these techniques train multiple Hidden Markov Models for different classes of activity. For a given activity sequence with multiple activities, the activity corresponding to the HMM with the maximum generating probability is selected as the recognition result, which is not suitable for continuous HAR with multiple activities. For this problem, we propose an improved Hidden Markov activity recognition algorithm where discriminative model and generative model are utilized. The discriminative model SVM is used to produce the observation sequence of HMM, and the generative model HMM is used to generate the final result.

The need for development of transportation technologies and infrastructural systems aimed at satisfying this increased demand is now non-negligible. As the number of private cars has increased after Industrial Revolution in spite of the unsufficient infrastructural capacity, the traffic problems are being confronted nowadays. As a solution to these problems, new roads are being built based on the predict and provide method which is part of todays traditional approach to transportation. However, it was found that new roads revive the stagnant demand, which even further complicate the traffic problem. In this context, it is believed that any solution focusing only on increasing the capacity and mobility in order to address the transportation problems will not be neither economical nor permanent. With this understanding in mind, traditional transportation approaches are replaced with sustainable transportation approaches with a trend initiated especially by the developed countries. The purpose of the sustainable transportation approach is to make investments into systems which place importance on accessibility; develop healthy, safe, equalitarian, comfortable and environmentally-friendly vehicle and infrastructure technologies; integrate transportation modes; which properly manage infrastructural capacity, passenger demands and operational supply; and relocate freight transportation to logistics centers. This study presents the historical development of sustainable transportation approaches and explores its principles in terms of environment, society and economy with award-winning exemplary projects, and offers recommendations for solutions to current problems of transportation in Turkey.",

Our non-invasive system collects accelerometer, pressure data, and GPS signals to recognize users daily activities, to track his/her location and to monitor wheelchair status. The proposed system was prototyped using the BodyCloud middleware so as to allow caregivers real-time access to the information generated by the smart wheelchair system. Finally, a case study is proposed to show the effectiveness of the assist system in extracting useful information by using multi-sensor data fusion.",

		"abstract": "Fall avoidance systems reduce injuries due to unintentional falls, but most of them are fall detections that activate an alarm after the fall occurrence. Since predicting a fall is the most promising approach to avoid a fall injury, this study proposes a method based on new features and multilayer perception that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Since accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in a smartphone are recognized to be precise enough to be used in fall avoidance systems, they have been exploited in an experimental analysis in order to compare the proposal with state-of-the-art approaches. The results have shown that the proposed approach improves the accuracy from 83% to 90%.",

		"abstract": "Neuropsychological tests are performance-based tasks to evaluate cognitive functions, but often they are particularly long and boring during their execution; these issues can interfere with performance provided by patients or healthy participants. In this paper, we present our gamified and virtually enhanced version of a specific neuropsychological test: The Baking Tray Task (BTT), aimed to assess unilateral spatial neglect (USN), a visuospatial processing disorder. This enhanced BTT version has been developed through STELT (Smart Technologies to Enhance Learning and Teaching) software, a platform which allows implementation of augmented reality systems based on RFID/NFC technology. These materials permit to link together smart technologies and physical materials, uniting the manipulative approach and digitalized technologies.",

		"abstract": "Mental stress is a physiological state that directly correlates to the quality of life of individuals.Zanetti, Matteo Generally speaking, but especially true for disabled or elderly subjects, the assessment of such condition represents a very strong indicator correlated to the difficulties, and, in some case, to the frustration that derives from the execution of a task that results troublesome to be accomplished.Faes, Luca This article describes a novel procedure for the assessment of the mental stress level through the use of low invasive wireless wearable devices. The information contained in electrocardiogram, respiratory signal, blood volume pulse, and electroencephalogram was extracted to set up an estimator for the cognitive workload level.De Cecco, Mariolino A random forest classifier was implemented to assess the level of mental stress starting from a pool of 3481Fornaser, Alberto features computed from the aforementioned physiological quantities. The proposed system was applied in a scenario in which two different mental states were elicited in the subject under investigation: first, a baseline resting condition was induced by the presentation of a relaxing video;Valente, Martina then a stressful cognitive state was provoked by the administration of a mental arithmetic task.Guandalini, Giovanni The random forestGiovanni, Giandomenico classifier shows an accuracy of 97.5% in discerning between these two mental states.",
