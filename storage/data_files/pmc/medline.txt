TI  - Building IoT Services for Aging in Place Using Standard-Based IoT Platforms and
      Heterogeneous IoT Products.
LID - 2311
AB  - An aging population and human longevity is a global trend. Many developed
      countries are struggling with the yearly increasing healthcare cost that
      dominantly affects their economy. At the same time, people living with old adults
      suffering from a progressive brain disorder such as Alzheimer’s disease are
      enduring even more stress and depression than those patients while caring for
      them. Accordingly, seniors’ ability to live independently and comfortably in
      their current home for as long as possible has been crucial to reduce the
      societal cost for caregiving and thus give family members peace of mind, called
      ‘aging in place’ (AIP). In this paper we present a way of building AIP services
      using standard-based IoT platforms and heterogeneous IoT products. An AIP service
      platform is designed and created by combining previous standard-based IoT
      platforms in a collaborative way. A service composition tool is also created that
      allows people to create AIP services in an efficient way. To show practical
      usability of our proposed system, we choose a service scenario for medication
      compliance and implement a prototype service which could give old adults
      medication reminder appropriately at the right time (i.e., when it is time to
      need to take pills) through light and speaker at home but also wrist band and
      smartphone even outside the home.

TI  - Smart Homes for Elderly Healthcare—Recent Advances and Research Challenges.
LID - 2496
AB  - Advancements in medical science and technology, medicine and public health
      coupled with increased consciousness about nutrition and environmental and
      personal hygiene have paved the way for the dramatic increase in life expectancy 
      globally in the past several decades. However, increased life expectancy has
      given rise to an increasing aging population, thus jeopardizing the
      socio-economic structure of many countries in terms of costs associated with
      elderly healthcare and wellbeing. In order to cope with the growing need for
      elderly healthcare services, it is essential to develop affordable, unobtrusive
      and easy-to-use healthcare solutions. Smart homes, which incorporate
      environmental and wearable medical sensors, actuators, and modern communication
      and information technologies, can enable continuous and remote monitoring of
      elderly health and wellbeing at a low cost. Smart homes may allow the elderly to 
      stay in their comfortable home environments instead of expensive and limited
      healthcare facilities. Healthcare personnel can also keep track of the overall
      health condition of the elderly in real-time and provide feedback and support
      from distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review 
      on the state-of-the-art research and development in smart home based remote
      healthcare technologies.

TI  - The SmartHabits: An Intelligent Privacy-Aware Home Care Assistance System.
LID - 907
AB  - Many researchers and product developers are striving toward achieving ICT-enabled
      independence of older adults by setting up Enhanced Living Environments (ELEs).
      Technological solutions, which are often based on the Internet of Things (IoT),
      show great potential in providing support for Active Aging. To enhance the
      quality of life for older adults and overcome challenges in enabling individuals 
      to achieve their full potential in terms of physical, social, and mental
      well-being, numerous proof-of-concept systems have been built. These systems,
      often labeled as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), vary greatly in targeting
      different user needs. This paper presents our contribution using SmartHabits,
      which is an intelligent privacy-aware home care assistance system. The novel
      system comprising smart home-based and cloud-based parts uses machine-learning
      technology to provide peace of mind to informal caregivers caring for persons
      living alone. It does so by learning the user’s typical daily activity patterns
      and automatically issuing warnings if an unusual situation is detected. The
      system was designed and implemented from scratch, building upon existing
      practices from IoT reference architecture and microservices. The system was
      deployed in several homes of real users for six months, and we will be sharing
      our findings in this paper.

TI  - An Indoor Monitoring System for Ambient Assisted Living Based on Internet of
      Things Architecture.
LID - 1152
AB  - The study of systems and architectures for ambient assisted living (AAL) is
      undoubtedly a topic of great relevance given the aging of the world population.
      The AAL technologies are designed to meet the needs of the aging population in
      order to maintain their independence as long as possible. As people typically
      spend more than 90% of their time in indoor environments, indoor air quality
      (iAQ) is perceived as an imperative variable to be controlled for the
      inhabitants’ wellbeing and comfort. Advances in networking, sensors, and embedded
      devices have made it possible to monitor and provide assistance to people in
      their homes. The continuous technological advancements make it possible to build 
      smart objects with great capabilities for sensing and connecting several possible
      advancements in ambient assisted living systems architectures. Indoor
      environments are characterized by several pollutant sources. Most of the
      monitoring frameworks instantly accessible are exceptionally costly and only
      permit the gathering of arbitrary examples. iAQ is an indoor air quality system
      based on an Internet of Things paradigm that incorporates in its construction
      Arduino, ESP8266, and XBee technologies for processing and data transmission and 
      micro sensors for data acquisition. It also allows access to data collected
      through web access and through a mobile application in real time, and this data
      can be accessed by doctors in order to support medical diagnostics. Five smaller 
      scale sensors of natural parameters (air temperature, moistness, carbon monoxide,
      carbon dioxide, and glow) were utilized. Different sensors can be included to
      check for particular contamination. The results reveal that the system can give a
      viable indoor air quality appraisal in order to anticipate technical
      interventions for improving indoor air quality. Indeed indoor air quality might
      be distinctively contrasted with what is normal for a quality living environment.

TI  - The Elderly’s Independent Living in Smart Homes: A Characterization of Activities
      and Sensing Infrastructure Survey to Facilitate Services Development.
PG  - 11312-62
AB  - Human activity detection within smart homes is one of the basis of unobtrusive
      wellness monitoring of a rapidly aging population in developed countries. Most
      works in this area use the concept of “activity” as the building block with which
      to construct applications such as healthcare monitoring or ambient assisted
      living. The process of identifying a specific activity encompasses the selection 
      of the appropriate set of sensors, the correct preprocessing of their provided
      raw data and the learning/reasoning using this information. If the selection of
      the sensors and the data processing methods are wrongly performed, the whole
      activity detection process may fail, leading to the consequent failure of the
      whole application. Related to this, the main contributions of this review are the
      following: first, we propose a classification of the main activities considered
      in smart home scenarios which are targeted to older people’s independent living, 
      as well as their characterization and formalized context representation; second, 
      we perform a classification of sensors and data processing methods that are
      suitable for the detection of the aforementioned activities. Our aim is to help
      researchers and developers in these lower-level technical aspects that are
      nevertheless fundamental for the success of the complete application.

TI  - Nothing Else Matters! Trade-Offs Between Perceived Benefits and Barriers of AAL
      Technology Usage.
LID - 134
AB  - Ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies present one approach to counter the
      challenges of demographic change in terms of an aging population, rising care
      needs, and lacking care personnel by supporting (older) people in need of care
      and enabling a longer and more independent staying at own home. Although the
      number of studies focusing on AAL users' acceptance and perception has increased 
      in the last years, trade-off decisions—the weighing of perceived benefits and
      barriers of technology usage—have not been studied so far. Nevertheless, this is 
      of high relevance: A realistic evaluation of adoption behaviors in different
      stakeholders (patients, care personnel) requires an understanding of exactly the 
      weighing process of benefits against the barriers in line with the decision of
      the final willingness to use AAL technology. The current study applied a conjoint
      analysis approach and investigates people's decision behavior to use an AAL
      system for a family member in need of care. Study participants (n = 140) had to
      decide between realistic care scenarios consisting of different options of two
      benefits (increase in safety, relief of caring burden of relatives) and two
      barriers (access to personal data and data handling) of technology usage. Results
      revealed data access and privacy to be most relevant for the decision to use AAL 
      technology at home. However, care experience essentially influenced the decision 
      patterns. For the care experienced group, data access should be limited to most
      trusted persons and close relatives, rather than to medical professionals. The
      most important reasons to use AAL are the emotional relief and the felt safety
      for the person in care. For care novices, in contrast, data access should be in
      the exclusive responsibility of medical professionals. The reasons that militate 
      in favor of using AAL technology are the increase in process efficiency and
      medical safety. The results are useful to develop user-tailored technology
      concepts and derive user-specific communication guidelines within and across
      clinical and home care contexts.

TI  - Enhancing the Ambient Assisted Living Capabilities with a Mobile Robot.
LID - 9412384
AB  - Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are currently a key focus of interest 
      as an option to assist and monitor disabled and elderly people. These systems can
      improve their quality of life and personal autonomy by detecting events such as
      entering potentially dangerous areas, potential fall events, or extended stays in
      the same place. Nonetheless, there are areas that remain outside the scope of AAL
      systems due to the placement of cameras. There also exist sources of danger in
      the scope of the camera that the AAL system cannot detect. These sources of
      danger are relatively small in size, occluded, or nonstatic. To solve this
      problem, we propose the inclusion of a robot which maps such uncovered areas
      looking for new potentially dangerous areas that go unnoticed by the AAL. The
      robot then sends this information to the AAL system in order to improve its
      performance. Experimentation in real-life scenarios successfully validates our
      approach.

TI  - Progress in ambient assisted systems for independent living by the elderly.
LID - 624
AB  - One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient
      delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the
      increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life
      expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in
      case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting 
      their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is
      costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients’ place 
      of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as
      the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing
      care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in
      telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity 
      of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things
      (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality.
      The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time
      monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven
      intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment,
      and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it
      is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to
      identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is,
      therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and
      sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their 
      objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our
      work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing
      immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors
      for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were
      often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as
      distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated.
      There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the
      implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups,
      acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to 
      look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.

TI  - OpenSHS: Open Smart Home Simulator.
LID - 1003
AB  - This paper develops a new hybrid, open-source, cross-platform 3D smart home
      simulator, OpenSHS, for dataset generation. OpenSHS offers an opportunity for
      researchers in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning to 
      test and evaluate their models. Following a hybrid approach, OpenSHS combines
      advantages from both interactive and model-based approaches. This approach
      reduces the time and efforts required to generate simulated smart home datasets. 
      We have designed a replication algorithm for extending and expanding a dataset. A
      small sample dataset produced, by OpenSHS, can be extended without affecting the 
      logical order of the events. The replication provides a solution for generating
      large representative smart home datasets. We have built an extensible library of 
      smart devices that facilitates the simulation of current and future smart home
      environments. Our tool divides the dataset generation process into three distinct
      phases: first design: the researcher designs the initial virtual environment by
      building the home, importing smart devices and creating contexts; second,
      simulation: the participant simulates his/her context-specific events; and third,
      aggregation: the researcher applies the replication algorithm to generate the
      final dataset. We conducted a study to assess the ease of use of our tool on the 
      System Usability Scale (SUS).

TI  - Co-Designing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Environments: Unravelling the Situated
      Context of Informal Dementia Care.
LID - 720483
AB  - Ambient assisted living (AAL) aims to help older persons “age-in-place” and
      manage everyday activities using intelligent and pervasive computing technology. 
      AAL research, however, has yet to explore how AAL might support or collaborate
      with informal care partners (ICPs), such as relatives and friends, who play
      important roles in the lives and care of persons with dementia (PwDs). In a
      multiphase codesign process with six (6) ICPs, we envisioned how AAL could be
      situated to complement their care. We used our codesigned “caregiver interface”
      artefacts as triggers to facilitate envisioning of AAL support and unpack the
      situated, idiosyncratic context within which AAL aims to assist. Our findings
      suggest that AAL should be designed to support ICPs in fashioning
      “do-it-yourself” solutions that complement tacitly improvised care strategies and
      enable them to try, observe, and adapt to solutions over time. In this way, an
      ICP could decide which activities to entrust to AAL support, when (i.e.,
      scheduled or spontaneous) and how a system should provide support (i.e., using
      personalized prompts based on care experience), and when adaptations to system
      support are needed (i.e., based alerting patterns and queried reports). Future
      longitudinal work employing participatory, design-oriented methods with care
      dyads is encouraged.

TI  - Smart Aging System: Uncovering the Hidden Wellness Parameter for Well-Being
      Monitoring and Anomaly Detection.
LID - 766
AB  - Background: Ambiguities and anomalies in the Activity of Daily Living (ADL)
      patterns indicate deviations from Wellness. The monitoring of lifestyles could
      facilitate remote physicians or caregivers to give insight into symptoms of the
      disease and provide health improvement advice to residents; Objective: This
      research work aims to apply lifestyle monitoring in an ambient assisted living
      (AAL) system by diagnosing conduct and distinguishing variation from the norm
      with the slightest conceivable fake alert. In pursuing this aim, the main
      objective is to fill the knowledge gap of two contextual observations (i.e., day 
      and time) in the frequent behavior modeling for an individual in AAL. Each
      sensing category has its advantages and restrictions. Only a single type of
      sensing unit may not manage composite states in practice and lose the activity of
      daily living. To boost the efficiency of the system, we offer an exceptional
      sensor data fusion technique through different sensing modalities; Methods: As
      behaviors may also change according to other contextual observations, including
      seasonal, weather (or temperature), and social interaction, we propose the design
      of a novel activity learning model by adding behavioral observations, which we
      name as the Wellness indices analysis model; Results: The ground-truth data are
      collected from four elderly houses, including daily activities, with a sample
      size of three hundred days plus sensor activation. The investigation results
      validate the success of our method. The new feature set from sensor data fusion
      enhances the system accuracy to (98.17% ± 0.95) from (80.81% ± 0.68). The
      performance evaluation parameters of the proposed model for ADL recognition are
      recorded for the 14 selected activities. These parameters are Sensitivity
      (0.9852), Specificity (0.9988), Accuracy (0.9974), F1 score (0.9851), False
      Negative Rate (0.0130).

TI  - Disseminating Ambient Assisted Living in Rural Areas.
PG  - 13496-531
AB  - The smart home, ambient intelligence and ambient assisted living have been
      intensively researched for decades. Although rural areas are an important
      potential market, because they represent about 80% of the territory of the EU
      countries and around 125 million inhabitants, there is currently a lack of
      applicable AAL solutions. This paper discusses the theoretical foundations of AAL
      in rural areas. This discussion is underlined by the achievements of the
      empirical field study, Casa Vecchia, which has been carried out over a four-year 
      period in a rural area in Austria. The major goal of Casa Vecchia was to evaluate
      the feasibility of a specific form of AAL for rural areas: bringing AAL
      technology to the homes of the elderly, rather than moving seniors to
      special-equipped care facilities. The Casa Vecchia project thoroughly
      investigated the possibilities, challenges and drawbacks of AAL related to this
      specific approach. The findings are promising and somewhat surprising and
      indicate that further technical, interactional and socio-psychological research
      is required to make AAL in rural areas reasonable in the future.

TI  - HDOMO: Smart Sensor Integration for an Active and Independent Longevity of the
      Elderly.
LID - 2610
AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the main results of HDOMO, an Ambient
      Assisted Living (AAL) project that involved 16 Small and Medium Enterprises
      (SMEs) and 2 research institutes. The objective of the project was to create an
      autonomous and automated domestic environment, primarily for elderly people and
      people with physical and motor disabilities. A known and familiar environment
      should help users in their daily activities and it should act as a virtual
      caregiver by calling, if necessary, relief efforts. Substantially, the aim of the
      project is to simplify the life of people in need of support, while keeping them 
      autonomous in their private environment. From a technical point of view, the
      project provides the use of different Smart Objects (SOs), able to communicate
      among each other, in a cloud base infrastructure, and with the assisted users and
      their caregivers, in a perspective of interoperability and standardization of
      devices, usability and effectiveness of alarm systems. In the state of the art
      there are projects that achieve only a few of the elements listed. The HDOMO
      project aims to achieve all of them in one single project effectively. The
      experimental trials performed in a real scenario demonstrated the accuracy and
      efficiency of the system in extracting and processing data in real time to
      promptly acting, and in providing timely response to the needs of the user by
      integrating and confirming main alarms with different interoperable smart
      sensors. The article proposes a new technique to improve the accuracy of the
      system in detecting alarms using a multi-SO approach with information fusion
      between different devices, proving that this architecture can provide robust and 
      reliable results on real environments.

TI  - Trust and Privacy Solutions Based on Holistic Service Requirements.
LID - 16
AB  - The products and services designed for Smart Cities provide the necessary tools
      to improve the management of modern cities in a more efficient way. These tools
      need to gather citizens’ information about their activity, preferences, habits,
      etc. opening up the possibility of tracking them. Thus, privacy and security
      policies must be developed in order to satisfy and manage the legislative
      heterogeneity surrounding the services provided and comply with the laws of the
      country where they are provided. This paper presents one of the possible
      solutions to manage this heterogeneity, bearing in mind these types of networks, 
      such as Wireless Sensor Networks, have important resource limitations. A
      knowledge and ontology management system is proposed to facilitate the
      collaboration between the business, legal and technological areas. This will ease
      the implementation of adequate specific security and privacy policies for a given
      service. All these security and privacy policies are based on the information
      provided by the deployed platforms and by expert system processing.

TI  - Towards an Architecture to Guarantee Both Data Privacy and Utility in the First
      Phases of Digital Clinical Trials.
LID - 4175
AB  - In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), drug developers can potentially
      access a wealth of real-world, participant-generated data that enable better
      insights and streamlined clinical trial processes. Protection of confidential
      data is of primary interest when it comes to health data, as medical condition
      influences daily, professional, and social life. Current approaches in digital
      trials entail that private user data are provisioned to the trial investigator
      that is considered a trusted party. The aim of this paper is to present the
      technical requirements and the research challenges to secure the flow and control
      of personal data and to protect the interests of all the involved parties during 
      the first phases of a clinical trial, namely the characterization of the
      potential patients and their possible recruitment. The proposed architecture will
      let the individuals keep their data private during these phases while providing a
      useful sketch of their data to the investigator. Proof-of-concept implementations
      are evaluated in terms of performances achieved in real-world environments.

TI  - Boosting a Low-Cost Smart Home Environment with Usage and Access Control Rules.
LID - 1886
AB  - Smart Home has gained widespread attention due to its flexible integration into
      everyday life. Pervasive sensing technologies are used to recognize and track the
      activities that people perform during the day, and to allow communication and
      cooperation of physical objects. Usually, the available infrastructures and
      applications leveraging these smart environments have a critical impact on the
      overall cost of the Smart Home construction, require to be preferably installed
      during the home construction and are still not user-centric. In this paper, we
      propose a low cost, easy to install, user-friendly, dynamic and flexible
      infrastructure able to perform runtime resources management by decoupling the
      different levels of control rules. The basic idea relies on the usage of
      off-the-shelf sensors and technologies to guarantee the regular exchange of
      critical information, without the necessity from the user to develop accurate
      models for managing resources or regulating their access/usage. This allows us to
      simplify the continuous updating and improvement, to reduce the maintenance
      effort and to improve residents’ living and security. A first validation of the
      proposed infrastructure on a case study is also presented.

TI  - HABITAT: An IoT Solution for Independent Elderly.
LID - 1258
AB  - In this work, a flexible and extensive digital platform for Smart Homes is
      presented, exploiting the most advanced technologies of the Internet of Things,
      such as Radio Frequency Identification, wearable electronics, Wireless Sensor
      Networks, and Artificial Intelligence. Thus, the main novelty of the paper is the
      system-level description of the platform flexibility allowing the
      interoperability of different smart devices. This research was developed within
      the framework of the operative project HABITAT (Home Assistance Based on the
      Internet of Things for the Autonomy of Everybody), aiming at developing smart
      devices to support elderly people both in their own houses and in retirement
      homes, and embedding them in everyday life objects, thus reducing the expenses
      for healthcare due to the lower need for personal assistance, and providing a
      better life quality to the elderly users.

TI  - Signature Inspired Home Environments Monitoring System Using IR-UWB Technology.
LID - 385
AB  - Home monitoring and remote care systems aim to ultimately provide independent
      living care scenarios through non-intrusive, privacy-protecting means. Their main
      aim is to provide care through appreciating normal habits, remotely recognizing
      changes and acting upon those changes either through informing the person
      themselves, care providers, family members, medical practitioners, or emergency
      services, depending on need. Care giving can be required at any age, encompassing
      young to the globally growing aging population. A non-wearable and unobtrusive
      architecture has been developed and tested here to provide a fruitful health and 
      wellbeing-monitoring framework without interfering in a user’s regular daily
      habits and maintaining privacy. This work focuses on tracking locations in an
      unobtrusive way, recognizing daily activities, which are part of maintaining a
      healthy/regular lifestyle. This study shows an intelligent and locally based edge
      care system (ECS) solution to identify the location of an occupant’s movement
      from daily activities using impulse radio-ultra wide band (IR-UWB) radar. A new
      method is proposed calculating the azimuth angle of a movement from the received 
      pulse and employing radar principles to determine the range of that movement.
      Moreover, short-term fourier transform (STFT) has been performed to determine the
      frequency distribution of the occupant’s action. Therefore, STFT, azimuth angle, 
      and range calculation together provide the information to understand how
      occupants engage with their environment. An experiment has been carried out for
      an occupant at different times of the day during daily household activities and
      recorded with time and room position. Subsequently, these time-frequency
      outcomes, along with the range and azimuth information, have been employed to
      train a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm for recognizing indoor
      locations when the person is moving around the house, where little or no movement
      indicates the occurrence of abnormalities. The implemented framework is connected
      with a cloud server architecture, which enables to act against any abnormality
      remotely. The proposed methodology shows very promising results through
      statistical validation and achieved over 90% testing accuracy in a real-time
      scenario.

TI  - A Mobile Virtual Butler to Bridge the Gap between Users and Ambient Assisted
      Living: A Smart Home Case Study.
PG  - 14302-29
AB  - Ambient Intelligence promises to transform current spaces into electronic
      environments that are responsive, assistive and sensitive to human presence.
      Those electronic environments will be fully populated with dozens, hundreds or
      even thousands of connected devices that share information and thus become
      intelligent. That massive wave of electronic devices will also invade everyday
      objects, turning them into smart entities, keeping their native features and
      characteristics while seamlessly promoting them to a new class of thinking and
      reasoning everyday objects. Although there are strong expectations that most of
      the users' needs can be fulfilled without their intervention, there are still
      situations where interaction is required. This paper presents work being done in 
      the field of human-computer interaction, focusing on smart home environments,
      while being a part of a larger project called Aging Inside a Smart Home. This
      initiative arose as a way to deal with a large scourge of our country, where lots
      of elderly persons live alone in their homes, often with limited or no physical
      mobility. The project relies on the mobile agent computing paradigm in order to
      create a Virtual Butler that provides the interface between the elderly and the
      smart home infrastructure. The Virtual Butler is receptive to user questions,
      answering them according to the context and knowledge of the AISH. It is also
      capable of interacting with the user whenever it senses that something has gone
      wrong, notifying next of kin and/or medical services, etc. The Virtual Butler is 
      aware of the user location and moves to the computing device which is closest to 
      the user, in order to be always present. Its avatar can also run in handheld
      devices keeping its main functionality in order to track user when s/he goes out.
      According to the evaluation carried out, the Virtual Butler is assessed as a very
      interesting and loved digital friend, filling the gap between the user and the
      smart home. The evaluation also showed that the Virtual Butler concept can be
      easily ported to other types of possible smart and assistive environments like
      airports, hospitals, shopping malls, offices, etc.

TI  - Experience in Evaluating AAL Solutions in Living Labs.
PG  - 7277-311
AB  - Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a complex field, where different technologies
      are integrated to offer solutions for the benefit of different stakeholders.
      Several evaluation techniques are commonly applied that tackle specific aspects
      of AAL; however, holistic evaluation approaches are lacking when addressing the
      needs of both developers and end-users. Living labs have been often used as
      real-life test and experimentation environments for co-designing AAL technologies
      and validating them with relevant stakeholders. During the last five years, we
      have been evaluating AAL systems and services in the framework of various
      research projects. This paper presents the lessons learned in this experience and
      proposes a set of harmonized guidelines to conduct evaluations in living labs.

TI  - Contributions of ambient assisted living for health and quality of life in the
      elderly and care services - a qualitative analysis from the experts’ perspective 
      of care service professionals.
LID - 112
AB  - Background: Because of the demographic change in industrial countries new
      technical solutions for the independent living of elderly will become important
      in the next years. Ambient Assisted Living seeks to address the upcoming
      challenges by providing technical aids for elderly and care givers. Therefore it 
      is crucial to understand how those socio-technical solutions can address their
      needs and quality of life (QOL). The aim of this study was to analyse the main
      needs of dependent elderly and to investigate how different solutions can
      contribute to health and quality of life. Methods: A qualitative study design
      consisting of interviews with 11 professionals of geriatric care organisations
      was chosen. The data analysis was done by applying the qualitative content
      analysis by Philipp Mayring. The analysis was based on the basic principle of the
      bio-psycho-social model of health Results: Ambient Assisted Living solutions and 
      assistive technologies can have positive impacts on different dimensions of
      health and quality of life. The needs and problems of elderly can be addressed by
      applying appropriate solutions which influence the physical, mental and social
      dimensions of quality of life. There are also benefits for social care providers,
      their staff and caring relatives of impaired elderly. Ambient Assisted Living
      solutions can also be used as a facilitator for operational optimization of care 
      services. Conclusions: Solutions for telemedicine and telecare which are
      connected to Ambient Assisted Living solutions will have the biggest positive
      impact on care giving services. Also simple technical aids can be beneficial for 
      elderly to enhance QOL by enabling autonomy in their familiar surroundings.

TI  - A Smart Sensing Architecture for Domestic Monitoring: Methodological Approach and
      Experimental Validation.
LID - 2310
AB  - Smart homes play a strategic role for improving life quality of people, enabling 
      to monitor people at home with numerous intelligent devices. Sensors can be
      installed to provide a continuous assistance without limiting the resident’s
      daily routine, giving her/him greater comfort, well-being and safety. This paper 
      is based on the development of domestic technological solutions to improve the
      life quality of citizens and monitor the users and the domestic environment,
      based on features extracted from the collected data. The proposed smart sensing
      architecture is based on an integrated sensor network to monitor the user and the
      environment to derive information about the user’s behavior and her/his health
      status. The proposed platform includes biomedical, wearable, and unobtrusive
      sensors for monitoring user’s physiological parameters and home automation
      sensors to obtain information about her/his environment. The sensor network
      stores the heterogeneous data both locally and remotely in Cloud, where machine
      learning algorithms and data mining strategies are used for user behavior
      identification, classification of user health conditions, classification of the
      smart home profile, and data analytics to implement services for the community.
      The proposed solution has been experimentally tested in a pilot study based on
      the development of both sensors and services for elderly users at home.

TI  - Hands-On Experiences in Deploying Cost-Effective Ambient-Assisted Living Systems.
PG  - 14487-512
AB  - Older adults’ preferences to remain independent in their own homes along with the
      high costs of nursing home care have motivated the development of Ambient
      Assisted Living (AAL) technologies which aim at improving the safety, health
      conditions and wellness of the elderly. This paper reports hands-on experiences
      in designing, implementing and operating UbiCare, an AAL based prototype system
      for elderly home care monitoring. The monitoring is based on the recording of
      environmental parameters like temperature and light intensity as well as
      micro-level incidents which allows one to infer daily activities like moving,
      sitting, sleeping, usage of electrical appliances and plumbing components. The
      prototype is built upon inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware (e.g., various
      sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, ZigBee-compatible wireless communication
      modules) and license-free software, thereby ensuring low system deployment costs.
      The network comprises nodes placed in a house’s main rooms or mounted on
      furniture, one wearable node, one actuator node and a centralized processing
      element (coordinator). Upon detecting significant deviations from the ordinary
      activity patterns of individuals and/or sudden falls, the system issues automated
      alarms which may be forwarded to authorized caregivers via a variety of
      communication channels. Furthermore, measured environmental parameters and
      activity incidents may be monitored through standard web interfaces.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Hands-on Health Informatics Skills Exercises in the
      Multidisciplinary Smart Home Healthcare and Health Informatics Training
      Laboratories.
PG  - 1184-96
AB  - Objective  This article aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of newly established 
      innovative smart home healthcare and health informatics laboratories, and a novel
      laboratory course that focuses on experiential health informatics training, and
      determine students' self-confidence to operate wireless home health monitoring
      devices before and after the hands-on laboratory course. Materials and Methods
       Two web-based pretraining and posttraining questionnaires were sent to 64
      students who received hands-on training with wireless remote patient monitoring
      devices in smart home healthcare and health informatics laboratories. Results
       All 64 students completed the pretraining survey (100% response rate), and 49
      students completed the posttraining survey (76% response rate). The quantitative 
      data analysis showed that 95% of students had an interest in taking more hands-on
      laboratory courses. Sixty-seven percent of students had no prior experience with 
      medical image, physiological data acquisition, storage, and transmission
      protocols. After the hands-on training session, 75.51% of students expressed
      improved confidence about training patients to measure blood pressure monitor
      using wireless devices. Ninety percent of students preferred to use a similar
      experiential approach in their future learning experience. Additionally, the
      qualitative data analysis demonstrated that students were expecting to have more 
      courses with hands-on exercises and integration of technology-enabled delivery
      and patient monitoring concepts into the curriculum. Conclusion  This study
      demonstrated that the multidisciplinary smart home healthcare and health
      informatics training laboratories and the hands-on exercises improved students'
      technology adoption rates and their self-confidence in using wireless patient
      monitoring devices.

TI  - Evaluation of Three State-of-the-Art Classifiers for Recognition of Activities of
      Daily Living from Smart Home Ambient Data.
PG  - 11725-40
AB  - Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the
      attention of the research community. The “health state” of smart homes is
      comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of
      citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the 
      arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor
      the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection
      and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to 
      detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to
      collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows
      the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition
      systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all
      ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home 
      sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same 
      activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities,
      our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity
      recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying
      overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day
      dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms
      and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM)
      and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized
      activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a
      precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM
      classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF
      classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction
      with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets
      collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could
      improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the
      functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective
      action in a smart city scenario.

TI  - The power(s) of observation: Theoretical perspectives on surveillance
      technologies and older people.
PG  - 512-30
AB  - There is a long history of surveillance of older adults in institutional settings
      and it is becoming an increasingly common feature of modern society. New
      surveillance technologies that include activity monitoring, and ubiquitous
      computing, which are described as ambient assisted living (AAL) are being
      developed to provide unobtrusive monitoring and support of activities of daily
      living and to extend the quality and length of time older people can live in
      their homes. However, concerns have been raised with how these kinds of
      technologies may affect user’s privacy and autonomy. The objectives of this paper
      are 1) to describe the development of home-based surveillance technologies; 2) to
      examine how surveillance is being restructured with the use of this technology;
      and 3) to explore the potential outcomes associated with the adoption of AAL as a
      means of surveillance by drawing upon the theoretical work of Foucault and
      Goffman. The discussion suggests that future research needs to consider two key
      areas beyond the current discourse on technology and ageing, specifically: 1) how
      the new technology will encroach upon the private lived space of the individual, 
      and 2) how it will affect formal and informal caring relationships. This is
      critical to ensure that the introduction of AAL does not contribute to the
      disempowerment of residents who receive this technology.

TI  - Assessing Older Adults’ Perceptions of Sensor Data and Designing Visual Displays 
      for Ambient Assisted Living Environments: An Exploratory Study.
PG  - 152-9
AB  - Objectives: Our objectives were to: 1) characterize older adult participants’
      perceived usefulness of in-home sensor data and 2) develop novel visual displays 
      for sensor data from Ambient Assisted Living environments that can become part of
      electronic health records. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted
      with community-dwelling older adult participants during three and six-month
      visits. We engaged participants in two design iterations by soliciting feedback
      about display types and visual displays of simulated data related to a fall
      scenario. Interview transcripts were analyzed to identify themes related to
      perceived usefulness of sensor data. Results: Thematic analysis identified three 
      themes: perceived usefulness of sensor data for managing health; factors that
      affect perceived usefulness of sensor data and; perceived usefulness of visual
      displays. Visual displays were cited as potentially useful for family members and
      health care providers. Three novel visual displays were created based on
      interview results, design guidelines derived from prior AAL research, and
      principles of graphic design theory. Conclusions: Participants identified
      potential uses of personal activity data for monitoring health status and
      capturing early signs of illness. One area for future research is to determine
      how visual displays of AAL data might be utilized to connect family members and
      health care providers through shared understanding of activity levels versus a
      more simplified view of self-management. Connecting informal and formal
      caregiving networks may facilitate better communication between older adults,
      family members and health care providers for shared decision-making.

TI  - An Indoor Positioning System Based on Wearables for Ambient-Assisted Living.
LID - 36
AB  - The urban population is growing at such a rate that by 2050 it is estimated that 
      84% of the world’s population will live in cities, with flats being the most
      common living place. Moreover, WiFi technology is present in most developed
      country urban areas, with a quick growth in developing countries. New
      Ambient-Assisted Living applications will be developed in the near future having 
      user positioning as ground technology: elderly tele-care, energy consumption,
      security and the like are strongly based on indoor positioning information. We
      present an indoor positioning system for wearable devices based on WiFi
      fingerprinting. Smart-watch wearable devices are used to acquire the WiFi
      strength signals of the surrounding Wireless Access Points used to build an
      ensemble of Machine Learning classification algorithms. Once built, the ensemble 
      algorithm is used to locate a user based on the WiFi strength signals provided by
      the wearable device. Experimental results for five different urban flats are
      reported, showing that the system is robust and reliable enough for locating a
      user at room level into his/her home. Another interesting characteristic of the
      presented system is that it does not require deployment of any infrastructure,
      and it is unobtrusive, the only device required for it to work is a smart-watch.

PG  - 11110-34
AB  - In the field of ambient assisted living, the best results are achieved with
      systems that are less intrusive and more intelligent, that can easily integrate
      both formal and informal caregivers and that can easily adapt to the changes in
      the situation of the elderly or disabled person. This paper presents a
      graph-based representation for context information and a simple and intuitive
      method for situation recognition. Both the input and the results are easy to
      visualize, understand and use. Experiments have been performed on several
      AAL-specific scenarios.

TI  - Real-Time User Identification and Behavior Prediction Based on Foot-Pad
      Recognition.
LID - 2899
AB  - In the IoT (Internet of things)-based smart home, the technology for recognizing 
      individual users among family members is very important. Although research in
      areas such as image recognition, biometrics, and individual wireless devices is
      very active, these systems suffer from various problems such as the need to
      follow an intentional procedure or own a specific device. Furthermore, with a
      centralized server system for IoT service, it is difficult to guarantee real-time
      determinism with high accuracy. To overcome these problems, we suggest a method
      of recognizing users in real time from the foot pressure characteristics measured
      as a user steps on a footpad. The proposed model in this paper uses a
      preprocessing algorithm to determine and generalize the angle of foot pressure.
      Based on this generalized foot pressure angle, we extract nine features that can 
      distinguish individual human beings, and employ these features in
      user-recognition algorithms. Performance evaluation of the model was conducted by
      combining two preprocessing algorithms used to generalize the angle with four
      user-recognition algorithms.

      Graphs, A Systematic Review.
LID - 1774
AB  - Ambient Intelligence is currently a lively application domain of Artificial
      Intelligence and has become the central subject of multiple initiatives
      worldwide. Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or
      knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of
      representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be
      contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent
      systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In
      this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge
      bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive
      and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart
      homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this
      context.

TI  - Automatic assessment of functional health decline in older adults based on smart 
      home data.
PG  - 119-30
AB  - In the context of an aging population, tools to help elderly to live
      independently must be developed. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the
      possibility of using unobtrusively collected activity-aware smart home behavioral
      data to automatically detect one of the most common consequences of aging:
      functional health decline. After gathering the longitudinal smart home data of 29
      older adults for an average of > 2 years, we automatically labeled the data with 
      corresponding activity classes and extracted time-series statistics containing 10
      behavioral features. Using this data, we created regression models to predict
      absolute and standardized functional health scores, as well as classification
      models to detect reliable absolute change and positive and negative fluctuations 
      in everyday functioning. Functional health was assessed every six months by means
      of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-Compensation (IADL-C) scale.
      Results show that total IADL-C score and subscores can be predicted by means of
      activity-aware smart home data, as well as a reliable change in these scores.
      Positive and negative fluctuations in everyday functioning are harder to detect
      using in-home behavioral data, yet changes in social skills have shown to be
      predictable. Future work must focus on improving the sensitivity of the presented
      models and performing an in-depth feature selection to improve overall accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation of a modular scalable system for silver-ager located in assisted
      living homes in Austria – study protocol of the ModuLAAr ambient assisted living 
      project.
PG  - 736
AB  - Background: To cope with the upcoming demographic change, economic efforts in the
      European Union are undertaken to promote activities in research and development
      of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions. As a result, a large variety of AAL
      products will be available in the next years. Only very few of these products are
      comprehensively evaluated regarding different aspects of quality of life in the
      target population. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of AAL on
      quality of life, health and technology acceptance of people at advanced age
      living in assisted living homes providing them the ModuLAAr Ambient Assisted
      Living system. Methods/Design: A treatment group of adults aged 60 years and
      older will be recruited within the participating assisted living homes. At
      baseline, the participating volunteers will report on quality of life, subjective
      health and sociodemographic conditions. After system installation, prospective
      follow-up (1, 4, 12 and 18 months) with additional reporting on technology
      acceptance and usability of the system will be conducted. Mixed methods data
      collection, linking quantitative data to interview-gathered qualitative data will
      be applied. Primary outcome measure will be the change in quality of life and
      subjective health across study duration. Discussion: As there is currently very
      little evidence that AAL solutions can contribute to improved health and the
      particular dimensions of quality of life in elderly persons, there is a need to
      assess these technologies and services more carefully. This field trial seeks to 
      investigate the most relevant aspects connected to advanced information and
      communication technologies and their impact on daily life of residents in
      assisted living conditions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02130102.

TI  - Distributed Channel Allocation and Time Slot Optimization for Green Internet of
      Things.
LID - 2479
AB  - In sustainable smart cities, power saving is a severe challenge in the
      energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient utilization of limited
      multiple non-overlap channels and time resources is a promising solution to
      reduce the network interference and save energy consumption. In this paper, we
      propose a joint channel allocation and time slot optimization solution for IoT.
      First, we propose a channel ranking algorithm which enables each node to rank its
      available channels based on the channel properties. Then, we propose a
      distributed channel allocation algorithm so that each node can choose a proper
      channel based on the channel ranking and its own residual energy. Finally, the
      sleeping duration and spectrum sensing duration are jointly optimized to maximize
      the normalized throughput and satisfy energy consumption constraints
      simultaneously. Different from the former approaches, our proposed solution
      requires no central coordination or any global information that each node can
      operate based on its own local information in a total distributed manner. Also,
      theoretical analysis and extensive simulations have validated that when applying 
      our solution in the network of IoT: (i) each node can be allocated to a proper
      channel based on the residual energy to balance the lifetime; (ii) the network
      can rapidly converge to a collision-free transmission through each node’s
      learning ability in the process of the distributed channel allocation; and (iii) 
      the network throughput is further improved via the dynamic time slot
      optimization.

TI  - Cyber security challenges in Smart Cities: Safety, security and privacy.
PG  - 491-7
AB  - The world is experiencing an evolution of Smart Cities. These emerge from
      innovations in information technology that, while they create new economic and
      social opportunities, pose challenges to our security and expectations of
      privacy. Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart
      energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many
      cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path
      to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are
      evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to
      unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city
      infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for
      monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and
      private, will access a web of interconnected data from GPS location to weather
      and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency
      responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled
      challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information
      and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital
      citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location 
      and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that
      gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological
      challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges. Their
      implementation is essential for a Smart City in which we would wish to live. We
      also present a model representing the interactions between person, servers and
      things. Those are the major element in the Smart City and their interactions are 
      what we need to protect.

      Railways.
LID - 1457
AB  - Nowadays, the railway industry is in a position where it is able to exploit the
      opportunities created by the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) and enabling
      communication technologies under the paradigm of Internet of Trains. This review 
      details the evolution of communication technologies since the deployment of
      GSM-R, describing the main alternatives and how railway requirements,
      specifications and recommendations have evolved over time. The advantages of the 
      latest generation of broadband communication systems (e.g., LTE, 5G, IEEE
      802.11ad) and the emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for the railway
      environment are also explained together with the strategic roadmap to ensure a
      smooth migration from GSM-R. Furthermore, this survey focuses on providing a
      holistic approach, identifying scenarios and architectures where railways could
      leverage better commercial IIoT capabilities. After reviewing the main industrial
      developments, short and medium-term IIoT-enabled services for smart railways are 
      evaluated. Then, it is analyzed the latest research on predictive maintenance,
      smart infrastructure, advanced monitoring of assets, video surveillance systems, 
      railway operations, Passenger and Freight Information Systems (PIS/FIS), train
      control systems, safety assurance, signaling systems, cyber security and energy
      efficiency. Overall, it can be stated that the aim of this article is to provide 
      a detailed examination of the state-of-the-art of different technologies and
      services that will revolutionize the railway industry and will allow for
      confronting today challenges.

TI  - Multimodal Wireless Sensor Network-Based Ambient Assisted Living in Real Homes
      with Multiple Residents.
PG  - 9692-719
AB  - Human activity recognition and behavior monitoring in a home setting using
      wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provide a great potential for ambient assisted
      living (AAL) applications, ranging from health and wellbeing monitoring to
      resource consumption monitoring. However, due to the limitations of the sensor
      devices, challenges in wireless communication and the challenges in processing
      large amounts of sensor data in order to recognize complex human activities,
      WSN-based AAL systems are not effectively integrated in the home environment.
      Additionally, given the variety of sensor types and activities, selecting the
      most suitable set of sensors in the deployment is an important task. In order to 
      investigate and propose solutions to such challenges, we introduce a WSN-based
      multimodal AAL system compatible for homes with multiple residents. Particularly,
      we focus on the details of the system architecture, including the challenges of
      sensor selection, deployment, networking and data collection and provide
      guidelines for the design and deployment of an effective AAL system. We also
      present the details of the field study we conducted, using the systems deployed
      in two different real home environments with multiple residents. With these
      systems, we are able to collect ambient sensor data from multiple homes. This
      data can be used to assess the wellbeing of the residents and identify deviations
      from everyday routines, which may be indicators of health problems. Finally, in
      order to elaborate on the possible applications of the proposed AAL system and to
      exemplify directions for processing the collected data, we provide the results of
      several human activity inference experiments, along with examples on how such
      results could be interpreted. We believe that the experiences shared in this work
      will contribute towards accelerating the acceptance of WSN-based AAL systems in
      the home setting.

TI  - The AM4I Architecture and Framework for Multimodal Interaction and Its
      Application to Smart Environments.
LID - 2587
AB  - Technologies, such as smart sensors, actuators, and other kinds of devices, are
      often installed in our environments (e.g., our Homes) and available to integrate 
      our daily lives. Despite their installation being motivated by the pursuit of
      automation and increased efficiency, making these environments usable, acceptable
      and enjoyable in a sustainable, energy efficient way is not only a matter of
      automation. Tackling these goals is a complex task demanding the combination of
      different perspectives including building and urban Architecture, Ubiquitous
      Computing and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to provide occupants with the
      means to shape these environments to their needs. Interaction is of paramount
      relevance in the creation of adequate relations of users with their environments,
      but it cannot be seen independently from the ubiquitous sensing and computing or 
      the environment’s architecture. In this regard, there are several challenges to
      HCI, particularly in how to integrate this multidisciplinary effort. Although
      there are several solutions to address some of these challenges, the complexity
      and dynamic nature of the smart environments and the diversity of technologies
      involved still present many challenges, particularly for its development. In
      general, the development is complex, and it is hard to create a dynamic
      environment providing versatile and adaptive forms of interaction. To participate
      in the multidisciplinary effort, the development of interaction must be supported
      by tools capable of facilitating co-design by multidisciplinary teams. In this
      article, we address the development of interaction for complex smart environments
      and propose the AM4I architecture and framework, a novel modular approach to
      design and develop adaptive multiplatform multilingual multi-device multimodal
      interactive systems. The potential of the framework is demonstrated by
      proof-of-concept applications in two different smart environment contexts,
      non-residential buildings and smart homes.

TI  - Participatory Research to Design a Novel Telehealth System to Support the
      Night-Time Needs of People with Dementia: NOCTURNAL.
PG  - 6764-82
AB  - Strategies to support people living with dementia are broad in scope, proposing
      both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions as part of the care
      pathway. Assistive technologies form part of this offering as both stand-alone
      devices to support particular tasks and the more complex offering of the “smart
      home” to underpin ambient assisted living. This paper presents a technology-based
      system, which expands on the smart home architecture, orientated to support
      people with daily living. The system, NOCTURNAL, was developed by working
      directly with people who had dementia, and their carers using qualitative
      research methods. The research focused primarily on the nighttime needs of people
      living with dementia in real home settings. Eight people with dementia had the
      final prototype system installed for a three month evaluation at home. Disturbed 
      sleep patterns, night-time wandering were a focus of this research not only in
      terms of detection by commercially available technology but also exploring if
      automated music, light and visual personalized photographs would be soothing to
      participants during the hours of darkness. The NOCTURNAL platform and associated 
      services was informed by strong user engagement of people with dementia and the
      service providers who care for them. NOCTURNAL emerged as a holistic service
      offering a personalised therapeutic aspect with interactive capabilities.

TI  - The Challenges of Urban Ageing: Making Cities Age-Friendly in Europe.
LID - 2473
AB  - Urban ageing is an emerging domain that deals with the population of older people
      living in cities. The ageing of society is a positive yet challenging phenomenon,
      as population ageing and urbanisation are the culmination of successful human
      development. One could argue whether the city environment is an ideal place for
      people to grow old and live at an old age compared to rural areas. This viewpoint
      article explores and describes the challenges that are encountered when making
      cities age-friendly in Europe. Such challenges include the creation of inclusive 
      neighbourhoods and the implementation of technology for ageing-in-place. Examples
      from projects in two age-friendly cities in The Netherlands (The Hague) and
      Poland (Cracow) are shown to illustrate the potential of making cities more tuned
      to the needs of older people and identify important challenges for the next
      couple of years. Overall, the global ageing of urban populations calls for more
      age-friendly approaches to be implemented in our cities. It is a challenge to
      prepare for these developments in such a way that both current and future
      generations of older people can benefit from age-friendly strategies.

TI  - Everyday Functioning Benefits from an Assisted Living Platform amongst Frail
      Older Adults and Their Caregivers.
LID - 302
AB  - Ambient assisted living technologies (AAL) are regarded as a promising solution
      to support aging in place. Yet, their efficacy has to be demonstrated in terms of
      benefits for independent living and for work conditions of caregivers. Hence, the
      purpose of this study was to assess the benefits of a multi-task AAL platform for
      both Frail older Individuals (FIs) and professional caregivers with respect to
      everyday functioning and caregiver burden. In this context, a 6-month field study
      involved 32 FIs living at home (half of them were equipped by the platform and
      the remaining half were not, as a control condition) and their caregivers.
      Everyday functioning measures were reported by frail participants and caregivers.
      Self-reported burden measures of caregiver were also collected. The main results 
      showed that the caregiver's estimates of everyday functioning of equipped
      participants were unchanged across time, while they decreased for the control
      participants. Also, a reduction of self-reported objective burden was obtained
      after 6 months of AAL intervention for the equipped group, compared to the
      control group. Overall, these results highlighted the potential of AAL as a
      relevant environmental support for preventing both functional losses in FIs and
      objective burden professional caregiver.

TI  - Unsupervised Machine Learning for Developing Personalised Behaviour Models Using 
      Activity Data.
LID - 1034
AB  - The goal of this study is to address two major issues that undermine the large
      scale deployment of smart home sensing solutions in people’s homes. These include
      the costs associated with having to install and maintain a large number of
      sensors, and the pragmatics of annotating numerous sensor data streams for
      activity classification. Our aim was therefore to propose a method to describe
      individual users’ behavioural patterns starting from unannotated data analysis of
      a minimal number of sensors and a ”blind” approach for activity recognition. The 
      methodology included processing and analysing sensor data from 17 older adults
      living in community-based housing to extract activity information at different
      times of the day. The findings illustrate that 55 days of sensor data from a
      sensor configuration comprising three sensors, and extracting appropriate
      features including a “busyness” measure, are adequate to build robust models
      which can be used for clustering individuals based on their behaviour patterns
      with a high degree of accuracy (>85%). The obtained clusters can be used to
      describe individual behaviour over different times of the day. This approach
      suggests a scalable solution to support optimising the personalisation of care by
      utilising low-cost sensing and analysis. This approach could be used to track a
      person’s needs over time and fine-tune their care plan on an ongoing basis in a
      cost-effective manner.

TI  - No place like home? Surveillance and what home means in old age.
PG  - 103-14
AB  - New surveillance technologies like those included in ambient assisted living are 
      being developed to improve the security and safety of ‘at risk’ older people, but
      ethical questions have been raised about the extent to which they compromise the 
      rights and privacy of the people being monitored. A qualitative study was
      conducted to understand the ways these novel surveillance technologies would
      influence their everyday experiences of home. Participants felt new forms of
      surveillance would influence their sense of security, autonomy, and
      self-confidence, and would alter perceptions of home. The findings emphasize the 
      need to improve our understanding of how ambient assisted living will affect the 
      lives of those being monitored.

TI  - A Review of Activity Trackers for Senior Citizens: Research Perspectives,
      Commercial Landscape and the Role of the Insurance Industry.
LID - 1277
AB  - The objective assessment of physical activity levels through wearable
      inertial-based motion detectors for the automatic, continuous and long-term
      monitoring of people in free-living environments is a well-known research area in
      the literature. However, their application to older adults can present particular
      constraints. This paper reviews the adoption of wearable devices in senior
      citizens by describing various researches for monitoring physical activity
      indicators, such as energy expenditure, posture transitions, activity
      classification, fall detection and prediction, gait and balance analysis, also by
      adopting consumer-grade fitness trackers with the associated limitations
      regarding acceptability. This review also describes and compares existing
      commercial products encompassing activity trackers tailored for older adults,
      thus providing a comprehensive outlook of the status of commercially available
      motion tracking systems. Finally, the impact of wearable devices on life and
      health insurance companies, with a description of the potential benefits for the 
      industry and the wearables market, was analyzed as an example of the potential
      emerging market drivers for such technology in the future.

TI  - Technological Ecosystems in Care and Assistance: A Systematic Literature Review.
LID - 708
AB  - Applying the concepts of technological ecosystems to the care and assistance
      domain is an emerging field that has gained interest during the last years, as
      they allow to describe the complex relationships between actors in a
      technologically boosted care domain. In that context, this paper presents a
      systematic review and mapping of the literature to identify, analyse and classify
      the published research carried out to provide care and assistance services under 
      a technological ecosystems’ perspective. Thirty-seven papers were identified in
      the literature as relevant and analysed in detail (between 2003–2018). The main
      findings show that it is indeed an emerging field, as few of the found ecosystem 
      proposals have been developed in the real world nor have they been tested with
      real users. In addition, a lot of research to date reports the proposal of
      platform-centric architectures developed over existing platforms not specifically
      developed for care and services provision. Employed sensor technologies for
      providing services have very diverse natures depending on the intended services
      to be provided. However, many of these technologies do not take into account
      medical standards. The degree of the ecosystems’ openness to adding new devices
      greatly depends on the approach followed, such as the type of middleware
      considered. Thus, there is still much work to be done in order to equate other
      more established ecosystems such as business or software ecosystems.

TI  - Ethical framework of assistive devices: review and reflection.
LID - 19
AB  - The population of ageing is growing significantly over the world, and there is an
      emerging demand for better healthcare services and more care centres. Innovations
      of Information and Communication Technology has resulted in development of
      various types of assistive robots to fulfil elderly’s needs and independency,
      whilst carrying out daily routine tasks. This makes it vital to have a clear
      understanding of elderly’s needs and expectations from assistive robots. This
      paper addresses current ethical issues to understand elderly’s prime needs. Also,
      we consider other general ethics with the purpose of applying these theories to
      form a proper ethics framework. In the ethics framework, the ethical concerns of 
      senior citizens will be prioritized to satisfy elderly’s needs and also to
      diminish related expenses to healthcare services.

TI  - A Smart Kitchen for Ambient Assisted Living.
PG  - 1629-53
AB  - The kitchen environment is one of the scenarios in the home where users can
      benefit from Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications. Moreover, it is the
      place where old people suffer from most domestic injuries. This paper presents a 
      novel design, implementation and assessment of a Smart Kitchen which provides
      Ambient Assisted Living services; a smart environment that increases elderly and 
      disabled people's autonomy in their kitchen-related activities through context
      and user awareness, appropriate user interaction and artificial intelligence. It 
      is based on a modular architecture which integrates a wide variety of home
      technology (household appliances, sensors, user interfaces, etc.) and associated 
      communication standards and media (power line, radio frequency, infrared and
      cabled). Its software architecture is based on the Open Services Gateway
      initiative (OSGi), which allows building a complex system composed of small
      modules, each one providing the specific functionalities required, and can be
      easily scaled to meet our needs. The system has been evaluated by a large number 
      of real users (63) and carers (31) in two living labs in Spain and UK. Results
      show a large potential of system functionalities combined with good usability and
      physical, sensory and cognitive accessibility.

TI  - What it Takes to Successfully Implement Technology for Aging in Place: Focus
      Groups With Stakeholders.
LID - e98
AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in empowering older adults to age in
      place by deploying various types of technology (ie, eHealth, ambient assisted
      living technology, smart home technology, and gerontechnology). However,
      initiatives aimed at implementing these technologies are complicated by the fact 
      that multiple stakeholder groups are involved. Goals and motives of stakeholders 
      may not always be transparent or aligned, yet research on convergent and
      divergent positions of stakeholders is scarce. Objective: To provide insight into
      the positions of stakeholder groups involved in the implementation of technology 
      for aging in place by answering the following questions: What kind of technology 
      do stakeholders see as relevant? What do stakeholders aim to achieve by
      implementing technology? What is needed to achieve successful implementations?
      Methods: Mono-disciplinary focus groups were conducted with participants (n=29)
      representing five groups of stakeholders: older adults (6/29, 21%), care
      professionals (7/29, 24%), managers within home care or social work organizations
      (5/29, 17%), technology designers and suppliers (6/29, 21%), and policy makers
      (5/29, 17%). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results:
      Stakeholders considered 26 different types of technologies to be relevant for
      enabling independent living. Only 6 out of 26 (23%) types of technology were
      mentioned by all stakeholder groups. Care professionals mentioned fewer different
      types of technology than other groups. All stakeholder groups felt that the
      implementation of technology for aging in place can be considered a success when 
      (1) older adults’ needs and wishes are prioritized during development and
      deployment of the technology, (2) the technology is accepted by older adults, (3)
      the technology provides benefits to older adults, and (4) favorable prerequisites
      for the use of technology by older adults exist. While stakeholders seemed to
      have identical aims, several underlying differences emerged, for example, with
      regard to who should pay for the technology. Additionally, each stakeholder group
      mentioned specific steps that need to be taken to achieve successful
      implementation. Collectively, stakeholders felt that they need to take the leap
      (ie, change attitudes, change policies, and collaborate with other
      organizations); bridge the gap (ie, match technology with individuals and
      stimulate interdisciplinary education); facilitate technology for the masses (ie,
      work on products and research that support large-scale rollouts and train target 
      groups on how to use technology); and take time to reflect (ie, evaluate use and 
      outcomes). Conclusions: Stakeholders largely agree on the direction in which they
      should be heading; however, they have different perspectives with regard to the
      technologies that can be employed and the work that is needed to implement them. 
      Central to these issues seems to be the tailoring of technology or technologies
      to the specific needs of each community-dwelling older adult and the work that is
      needed by stakeholders to support this type of service delivery on a large scale.

TI  - m-Health: Lessons Learned by m-Experiences.
LID - 1569
AB  - m-Health is an emerging area that is transforming how people take part in the
      control of their wellness condition. This vision is changing traditional health
      processes by discharging hospitals from the care of people. Important advantages 
      of continuous monitoring can be reached but, in order to transform this vision
      into a reality, some factors need to be addressed. m-Health applications should
      be shared by patients and hospital staff to perform proper supervised health
      monitoring. Furthermore, the uses of smartphones for health purposes should be
      transformed to achieve the objectives of this vision. In this work, we analyze
      the m-Health features and lessons learned by the experiences of systems developed
      by MAmI Research Lab. We have focused on three main aspects: m-interaction, use
      of frameworks, and physical activity recognition. For the analysis of the
      previous aspects, we have developed some approaches to: (1) efficiently manage
      patient medical records for nursing and healthcare environments by introducing
      the NFC technology; (2) a framework to monitor vital signs, obesity and
      overweight levels, rehabilitation and frailty aspects by means of
      accelerometer-enabled smartphones and, finally; (3) a solution to analyze daily
      gait activity in the elderly, carrying a single inertial wearable close to the
      first thoracic vertebra.

TI  - Iterative Design of Visual Analytics for a Clinician-in-the-loop Smart Home.
PG  - 1742-8
AB  - In order to meet the health needs of the coming “age wave”, technology needs to
      be designed that supports remote health monitoring and assessment. In this study 
      we design CIL, a clinician-in-the-loop visual interface, that provides clinicians
      with patient behavior patterns, derived from smart home data. A total of 60
      experienced nurses participated in an iterative design of an interactive
      graphical interface for remote behavior monitoring. Results of the study indicate
      that usability of the system improves over multiple iterations of participatory
      design. In addition, the resulting interface is useful for identifying behavior
      patterns that are indicative of chronic health conditions and unexpected health
      events. This technology offers the potential to support self-management and
      chronic conditions, even for individuals living in remote locations.

TI  - A Framework for a Context-Aware Elderly Entertainment Support System.
PG  - 10538-61
AB  - Elderly people constitute a major portion of world's population. Many of them are
      physically and mentally vulnerable and need continuous support for their health
      and well-being. There is a growing trend that these elderly people are placed in 
      an ambient assisted living environment (AAL) with an aim to receive better care
      and support. In such settings, a lot of attention has been given to continuous
      health monitoring for maintaining physical health status. However, much less
      attention has been given toward understanding the entertainment needs of the
      elderly people, which is an important factor relevant to their mental health and 
      joyful living. This paper thus addresses the entertainment needs of the elderly
      and proposes a framework of an elderly entertainment support system. The proposed
      framework enables different categories of residents (e.g., elderly people and
      caregivers) to access various media services in both implicit and explicit manner
      in order to enhance the quality of their living experience in different contexts.
      Our experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework. We 
      believe that the proposed approach will establish the need to develop
      entertainment systems and services for the elderly people and allow us to
      sensibly address the problems associated with their independent, happy and active
      living.

TI  - A Remote Health Monitoring System for the Elderly Based on Smart Home Gateway.
LID - 5843504
AB  - This paper proposed a remote health monitoring system for the elderly based on
      smart home gateway. The proposed system consists of three parts: the smart
      clothing, the smart home gateway, and the health care server. The smart clothing 
      collects the elderly's electrocardiogram (ECG) and motion signals. The home
      gateway is used for data transmission. The health care server provides services
      of data storage and user information management; it is constructed on the
      Windows-Apache-MySQL-PHP (WAMP) platform and is tested on the Ali Cloud platform.
      To resolve the issues of data overload and network congestion of the home
      gateway, an ECG compression algorithm is applied. System demonstration shows that
      the ECG signals and motion signals of the elderly can be monitored. Evaluation of
      the compression algorithm shows that it has a high compression ratio and low
      distortion and consumes little time, which is suitable for home gateways. The
      proposed system has good scalability, and it is simple to operate. It has the
      potential to provide long-term and continuous home health monitoring services for
      the elderly.

TI  - Ambient Sensors for Elderly Care and Independent Living: A Survey.
LID - 2027
AB  - Elderly care at home is a matter of great concern if the elderly live alone,
      since unforeseen circumstances might occur that affect their well-being.
      Technologies that assist the elderly in independent living are essential for
      enhancing care in a cost-effective and reliable manner. Elderly care applications
      often demand real-time observation of the environment and the resident’s
      activities using an event-driven system. As an emerging area of research and
      development, it is necessary to explore the approaches of the elderly care system
      in the literature to identify current practices for future research directions.
      Therefore, this work is aimed at a comprehensive survey of non-wearable (i.e.,
      ambient) sensors for various elderly care systems. This research work is an
      effort to obtain insight into different types of ambient-sensor-based elderly
      monitoring technologies in the home. With the aim of adopting these technologies,
      research works, and their outcomes are reported. Publications have been included 
      in this survey if they reported mostly ambient sensor-based monitoring
      technologies that detect elderly events (e.g., activities of daily living and
      falls) with the aim of facilitating independent living. Mostly, different types
      of non-contact sensor technologies were identified, such as motion, pressure,
      video, object contact, and sound sensors. Besides, multicomponent technologies
      (i.e., combinations of ambient sensors with wearable sensors) and smart
      technologies were identified. In addition to room-mounted ambient sensors,
      sensors in robot-based elderly care works are also reported. Research that is
      related to the use of elderly behavior monitoring technologies is widespread, but
      it is still in its infancy and consists mostly of limited-scale studies. Elderly 
      behavior monitoring technology is a promising field, especially for long-term
      elderly care. However, monitoring technologies should be taken to the next level 
      with more detailed studies that evaluate and demonstrate their potential to
      contribute to prolonging the independent living of elderly people.

TI  - Health-Assistive Smart Homes for Aging in Place: Leading the Way for Integration 
      of the Asian Immigrant Minority Voice.
PG  - 154-9
AB  - Caring for America’s aging population is a complex humanitarian issue. The number
      of older adults is expected to increase to 98.5 million by 2060 with a 295%
      growth in foreign-born older adults, including Asian immigrants. Most older
      adults will have one or more chronic conditions and 95% of healthcare costs will 
      be attributed to caring for these conditions. Among Asian Americans, common
      chronic conditions include respiratory disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease,
      and pain. The National Institutes of Health, Institute on Aging, and National
      Science Foundation call for innovative technologies to be developed by
      multidisciplinary teams to address these concerns. Asian community leaders at
      Asian Health & Service Center and community members in Oregon identified the use 
      of health-assistive technologies as a priority for potentially reducing stress
      and improving quality of life for both older adults and their caregivers. The
      purpose of this article is to introduce nurses and healthcare workers, advocating
      for the interests of Asian/Pacific Island community members, to the innovative
      health-assistive smart home. The health-assistive smart home uses artificial
      intelligence to identify and predict health events. Inclusion of minority
      persons’ data in the development of artificial intelligence has been generally
      overlooked. This may result in continued health inequities and is incompatible
      with the goals of global health. Integration of minority voices while exploring
      the efficacious use of the health-assistive smart home is of significant value to
      minority populations. Asian immigrant older adults engaging in smart home
      research and development will enhance the cultural and technical safety of future
      devices. Asian families may be particularly interested in smart homes for
      extending independence because they place an emphasis on collective culture and
      family-based care. Community engagement of stakeholders and steadfast leadership 
      are needed so that future technologies used in healthcare delivery are both
      technically and culturally sound. A community-engaged research approach promotes 
      community empowerment that is responsive to community identified priorities and
      is a good fit for studying adoption of smart home monitoring for
      health-assistance.

TI  - Bath-Ambience—A Mechatronic System for Assisting the Caregivers of Bedridden
      People.
LID - 1156
AB  - The health of older people is receiving special attention and dedication
      nowadays, with the aim of increasing their general wellbeing and quality of life.
      Studies into different aspects of the care of the elderly have found that
      emphasis should be given to solving problems related to bathing in different
      situations and environments. In particular, it is important to develop new
      assistive technologies to streamline and ease the burden of a caregiver’s daily
      tasks. Generally-speaking, in the case of bedridden patients, bathing is
      typically carried out manually by a caregiver, using towels, sponges, and a water
      basin. Nevertheless, this apparently simple task needs some precautions in order 
      to avoid the risk of microbial infections, falls and other injuries. With that in
      mind, this paper presents the design of a portable washing system, called
      Bath-Ambience, which enables bedridden patients to be bathed efficiently without 
      having to be moved from their position. This portable system can be installed in 
      different situations, both in a domestic setting, and in specialized
      institutions, and allows the caregiver to perform the bathing tasks without
      compromising health and safety, thereby making it possible to offer a comfortable
      and hygienic procedure to patients, improving their quality of life. This paper
      presents the design of the portable Bath-Ambience washing system, which provides 
      efficient assistance for bathing bedridden patients without moving them to
      another place. This system is mainly dedicated for integration a smart home
      application in to allow bathing everywhere.

TI  - A Behaviour Monitoring System (BMS) for Ambient Assisted Living.
LID - 1946
AB  - Unusual changes in the regular daily mobility routine of an elderly person at
      home can be an indicator or early symptom of developing health problems. Sensor
      technology can be utilised to complement the traditional healthcare systems to
      gain a more detailed view of the daily mobility of a person at home when
      performing everyday tasks. We hypothesise that data collected from low-cost
      sensors such as presence and occupancy sensors can be analysed to provide
      insights on the daily mobility habits of the elderly living alone at home and to 
      detect routine changes. We validate this hypothesis by designing a system that
      automatically learns the daily room-to-room transitions and permanence habits in 
      each room at each time of the day and generates alarm notifications when
      deviations are detected. We present an algorithm to process the sensors’ data
      streams and compute sensor-driven features that describe the daily mobility
      routine of the elderly as part of the developed Behaviour Monitoring System
      (BMS). We are able to achieve low detection delay with confirmation time that is 
      high enough to convey the detection of a set of common abnormal situations. We
      illustrate and evaluate BMS with synthetic data, generated by a developed data
      generator that was designed to mimic different user’s mobility profiles at home, 
      and also with a real-life dataset collected from prior research work. Results
      indicate BMS detects several mobility changes that can be symptoms of common
      health problems. The proposed system is a useful approach for learning the
      mobility habits at the home environment, with the potential to detect behaviour
      changes that occur due to health problems, and therefore, motivating progress
      toward behaviour monitoring and elder’s care.

TI  - An Ecological Approach to Smart Homes for Health Care Services: Conceptual
      Framework of a Smart Servicescape Wheel.
LID - e12425
AB  - Background: Smart homes are considered effective solutions for home health care
      for the elderly, as smart home technologies can reduce care costs and improve
      elderly residents’ independence. To develop a greater understanding of smart
      homes for health care services (SHHSs), this study accentuated the necessity of
      ecological approaches with an emphasis on environmental constraints. This study
      was based on 2 rationales: (1) users are inclined to perceive the service quality
      and service experience from environments (ie, servicescape) owing to the
      intangibility of health care and the pervasiveness of smart home technologies,
      and (2) both service domains are complex adaptive systems in which diversified
      and undefined service experiences—not only a few intended service flows—can be
      generated by complex combinations of servicescape elements. Objective: This study
      proposed the conceptual framework of a Smart Servicescape Wheel (SSW) as an
      ecological approach delineating the extensive spectrum of environmental
      constraints in SHHSs. Methods: The SSW framework was established based on a
      literature review. Results: Generally divided by perceptible and imperceptible
      servicescapes, the SSW consists of the perceptible Physical scape (ie, hardware
      components, environmental cues, and human states) and Social scape (ie, service
      relationships and social relationships) as well as the imperceptible Datascape
      (ie, computing intelligence, databases, and communication networks). Following
      the ecological approach, each category of the SSW is subdivided and defined at
      the level of components or functions. Conclusions: The SSW’s strengths lie in the
      various application opportunities for SHHSs. In terms of service planning and
      development, the SSW can be utilized to (1) establish the requirements for SHHS
      development, (2) associate with work domain analysis by defining component
      layers, and (3) understand the real contexts of SHHSs for the enhanced prediction
      of diverse service experiences. Regarding service management, it can be applied
      to develop measurement items for the operation and evaluation of SHHSs.

TI  - Human Activity Recognition in AAL Environments Using Random Projections.
LID - 4073584
AB  - Automatic human activity recognition systems aim to capture the state of the user
      and its environment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors attached to the subject's
      body and permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals
      reflecting the state of human actions. Successful identification of human
      activities can be immensely useful in healthcare applications for Ambient
      Assisted Living (AAL), for automatic and intelligent activity monitoring systems 
      developed for elderly and disabled people. In this paper, we propose the method
      for activity recognition and subject identification based on random projections
      from high-dimensional feature space to low-dimensional projection space, where
      the classes are separated using the Jaccard distance between probability density 
      functions of projected data. Two HAR domain tasks are considered: activity
      identification and subject identification. The experimental results using the
      proposed method with Human Activity Dataset (HAD) data are presented.

TI  - The Light Node Communication Framework: A New Way to Communicate Inside Smart
      Homes.
LID - 2397
AB  - The Internet of things has profoundly changed the way we imagine information
      science and architecture, and smart homes are an important part of this domain.
      Created a decade ago, the few existing prototypes use technologies of the day,
      forcing designers to create centralized and costly architectures that raise some 
      issues concerning reliability, scalability, and ease of access which cannot be
      tolerated in the context of assistance. In this paper, we briefly introduce a new
      kind of architecture where the focus is placed on distribution. More
      specifically, we respond to the first issue we encountered by proposing a
      lightweight and portable messaging protocol. After running several tests, we
      observed a maximized bandwidth, whereby no packets were lost and good encryption 
      was obtained. These results tend to prove that our innovation may be employed in 
      a real context of distribution with small entities.

TI  - Cloud-Based Behavioral Monitoring in Smart Homes.
LID - 1951
AB  - Environmental sensors are exploited in smart homes for many purposes. Sensor data
      inherently carries behavioral information, possibly useful to infer wellness and 
      health-related insights in an indirect fashion. In order to exploit such
      features, however, powerful analytics are needed to convert raw sensor output
      into meaningful and accessible knowledge. In this paper, a complete monitoring
      architecture is presented, including home sensors and cloud-based back-end
      services. Unsupervised techniques for behavioral data analysis are presented,
      including: (i) regression and outlier detection models (also used as feature
      extractors for more complex models); (ii) statistical hypothesis testing
      frameworks for detecting changes in sensor-detected activities; and (iii) a
      clustering process, leveraging deep learning techniques, for extracting complex, 
      multivariate patterns from daily sensor data. Such methods are discussed and
      evaluated on real-life data, collected within several EU-funded projects.
      Overall, the presented methods may prove very useful to build effective
      monitoring services, suitable for practical exploitation in caregiving
      activities, complementing conventional telemedicine techniques.

TI  - Simulation of Smart Home Activity Datasets.
PG  - 14162-79
AB  - A globally ageing population is resulting in an increased prevalence of chronic
      conditions which affect older adults. Such conditions require long-term care and 
      management to maximize quality of life, placing an increasing strain on
      healthcare resources. Intelligent environments such as smart homes facilitate
      long-term monitoring of activities in the home through the use of sensor
      technology. Access to sensor datasets is necessary for the development of novel
      activity monitoring and recognition approaches. Access to such datasets is
      limited due to issues such as sensor cost, availability and deployment time. The 
      use of simulated environments and sensors may address these issues and facilitate
      the generation of comprehensive datasets. This paper provides a review of
      existing approaches for the generation of simulated smart home activity datasets,
      including model-based approaches and interactive approaches which implement
      virtual sensors, environments and avatars. The paper also provides recommendation
      for future work in intelligent environment simulation.

TI  - A Review of Wearable Technologies for Elderly Care that Can Accurately Track
      Indoor Position, Recognize Physical Activities and Monitor Vital Signs in Real
      Time.
LID - 341
AB  - Rapid growth of the aged population has caused an immense increase in the demand 
      for healthcare services. Generally, the elderly are more prone to health problems
      compared to other age groups. With effective monitoring and alarm systems, the
      adverse effects of unpredictable events such as sudden illnesses, falls, and so
      on can be ameliorated to some extent. Recently, advances in wearable and sensor
      technologies have improved the prospects of these service systems for assisting
      elderly people. In this article, we review state-of-the-art wearable technologies
      that can be used for elderly care. These technologies are categorized into three 
      types: indoor positioning, activity recognition and real time vital sign
      monitoring. Positioning is the process of accurate localization and is
      particularly important for elderly people so that they can be found in a timely
      manner. Activity recognition not only helps ensure that sudden events (e.g.,
      falls) will raise alarms but also functions as a feasible way to guide people’s
      activities so that they avoid dangerous behaviors. Since most elderly people
      suffer from age-related problems, some vital signs that can be monitored
      comfortably and continuously via existing techniques are also summarized.
      Finally, we discussed a series of considerations and future trends with regard to
      the construction of “smart clothing” system.

TI  - Automated Clinical Assessment from Smart home-based Behavior Data.
PG  - 1188-94
AB  - Smart home technologies offer potential benefits for assisting clinicians by
      automating health monitoring and well-being assessment. In this paper, we examine
      the actual benefits of smart home-based analysis by monitoring daily behaviour in
      the home and predicting standard clinical assessment scores of the residents. To 
      accomplish this goal, we propose a Clinical Assessment using Activity Behavior
      (CAAB) approach to model a smart home resident’s daily behavior and predict the
      corresponding standard clinical assessment scores. CAAB uses statistical features
      that describe characteristics of a resident’s daily activity performance to train
      machine learning algorithms that predict the clinical assessment scores. We
      evaluate the performance of CAAB utilizing smart home sensor data collected from 
      18 smart homes over two years using prediction and classification-based
      experiments. In the prediction-based experiments, we obtain a statistically
      significant correlation (r = 0.72) between CAAB-predicted and clinician-provided 
      cognitive assessment scores and a statistically significant correlation (r =
      0.45) between CAAB-predicted and clinician-provided mobility scores. Similarly,
      for the classification-based experiments, we find CAAB has a classification
      accuracy of 72% while classifying cognitive assessment scores and 76% while
      classifying mobility scores. These prediction and classification results suggest 
      that it is feasible to predict standard clinical scores using smart home sensor
      data and learning-based data analysis.

TI  - Successful Aging: Advancing the Science of Physical Independence in Older Adults.
PG  - 304-27
AB  - The concept of ‘Successful Aging’ has long intrigued the scientific community.
      Despite this long-standing interest, a consensus definition has proven to be a
      difficult task, due to the inherent challenge involved in defining such a
      complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon. The lack of a clear set of defining
      characteristics for the construct of successful aging has made comparison of
      findings across studies difficult and has limited advances in aging research. The
      domain in which consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is
      the domain of physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an
      excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of
      physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the
      present article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health
      conditions, behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining
      mobility and physical function and promising interventions to counter these
      effects. With life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and
      developed countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health
      focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.

TI  - Exploratory analysis of real personal emergency response call conversations:
      considerations for personal emergency response spoken dialogue systems.
LID - 97
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to derive data from real, recorded,
      personal emergency response call conversations to help improve the artificial
      intelligence and decision making capability of a spoken dialogue system in a
      smart personal emergency response system. The main study objectives were to:
      develop a model of personal emergency response; determine categories for the
      model’s features; identify and calculate measures from call conversations (verbal
      ability, conversational structure, timing); and examine conversational patterns
      and relationships between measures and model features applicable for improving
      the system’s ability to automatically identify call model categories and predict 
      a target response. Methods: This study was exploratory and used mixed methods.
      Personal emergency response calls were pre-classified according to call model
      categories identified qualitatively from response call transcripts. The
      relationships between six verbal ability measures, three conversational structure
      measures, two timing measures and three independent factors: caller type, risk
      level, and speaker type, were examined statistically. Results: Emergency medical 
      response services were the preferred response for the majority of medium and high
      risk calls for both caller types. Older adult callers mainly requested
      non-emergency medical service responders during medium risk situations. By
      measuring the number of spoken words-per-minute and turn-length-in-words for the 
      first spoken utterance of a call, older adult and care provider callers could be 
      identified with moderate accuracy. Average call taker response time was
      calculated using the number-of-speaker-turns and time-in-seconds measures. Care
      providers and older adults used different conversational strategies when
      responding to call takers. The words ‘ambulance’ and ‘paramedic’ may hold
      different latent connotations for different callers. Conclusions: The data
      derived from the real personal emergency response recordings may help a spoken
      dialogue system classify incoming calls by caller type with moderate probability 
      shortly after the initial caller utterance. Knowing the caller type, the target
      response for the call may be predicted with some degree of probability and the
      output dialogue could be tailored to this caller type. The average call taker
      response time measured from real calls may be used to limit the conversation
      length in a spoken dialogue system before defaulting to a live call taker.

      study we use smart home and wearable sensors to collect data while (n=84) older
      adults perform complex activities of daily living. We analyze the data using
      machine learning techniques and reveal that differences between healthy older
      adults and adults with Parkinson disease not only exist in their activity
      patterns, but that these differences can be automatically recognized. Our machine
      learning classifiers reach an accuracy of 0.97 with an AUC value of 0.97 in
      distinguishing these groups. Our permutation-based testing confirms that the
      sensor-based differences between these groups are statistically significant.

TI  - A Survey on Ambient Intelligence in Health Care.
PG  - 2470-94
AB  - Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at
      empowering people’s capabilities by the means of digital environments that are
      sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and
      emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative
      human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive and
      anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make ambient
      intelligence technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life
      solutions, including in the health care domain. This survey will discuss the
      emergence of ambient intelligence (AmI) techniques in the health care domain, in 
      order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will
      examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of
      ambient intelligence, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We
      will summarize of the state of the art artificial intelligence methodologies used
      for developing AmI system in the health care domain, including various learning
      techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for
      reasoning about users’ goals and intensions) and planning techniques (for
      planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology
      might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or
      chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in
      the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the
      possible future research paths.

TI  - Forecasting Behavior in Smart Homes Based on Sleep and Wake Patterns.
PG  - 89-110
AB  - Background: The goal of this research is to use smart home technology to assist
      people who are recovering from injuries or coping with disabilities to live
      independently. Objective: We introduce an algorithm to model and forecast wake
      and sleep behaviors that are exhibited by the participant. Furthermore, we
      propose that sleep behavior is impacted by and can be modeled from wake behavior,
      and vice versa. Methods: This paper describes the Behavior Forecasting (BF)
      algorithm. BF consists of 1) defining numeric values that reflect sleep and wake 
      behavior, 2) forecasting wake and sleep values from past behavior, 3) analyzing
      the effect of wake behavior on sleep and vice versa, and 4) improving prediction 
      performance by using both wake and sleep scores. Results: The BF method was
      evaluated with data collected from 20 smart homes. We found that regardless of
      the forecasting method utilized, wake behavior and sleep behavior can be modeled 
      with a minimum accuracy of 84%. Additionally, normalizing the wake and sleep
      scores drastically improves the accuracy to 99%. Conclusions: The results show
      that we can effectively model wake and sleep behaviors in a smart environment.
      Furthermore, wake behaviors can be predicted from sleep behaviors and vice versa.

TI  - Sensor Network Infrastructure for a Home Care Monitoring System.
PG  - 3833-60
AB  - This paper presents the sensor network infrastructure for a home care system that
      allows long-term monitoring of physiological data and everyday activities. The
      aim of the proposed system is to allow the elderly to live longer in their home
      without compromising safety and ensuring the detection of health problems. The
      system offers the possibility of a virtual visit via a teleoperated robot. During
      the visit, physiological data and activities occurring during a period of time
      can be discussed. These data are collected from physiological sensors (e.g.,
      temperature, blood pressure, glucose) and environmental sensors (e.g., motion,
      bed/chair occupancy, electrical usage). The system can also give alarms if sudden
      problems occur, like a fall, and warnings based on more long-term trends, such as
      the deterioration of health being detected. It has been implemented and tested in
      a test environment and has been deployed in six real homes for a year-long
      evaluation. The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of an
      implemented system for ambient assisted living (AAL) tested in a real
      environment, combining the acquisition of sensor data, a flexible and adaptable
      middleware compliant with the OSGistandard and a context recognition application.
      The system has been developed in a European project called GiraffPlus.

TI  - Smart home in a box: usability study for a large scale self-installation of smart
      home technologies.
PG  - 93-106
AB  - This study evaluates the ability of users to self-install a smart home in a box
      (SHiB) intended for use by a senior population. SHiB is a ubiquitous system,
      developed by the Washington State University Center for Advanced Studies in
      Adaptive Systems (CASAS). Participants involved in this study are from the
      greater Palouse region of Washington State, and there are 13 participants in the 
      study with an average age of 69.23. The SHiB package, which included several
      different types of components to collect and transmit sensor data, was given to
      participants to self-install. After installation of the SHiB, the participants
      were visited by researchers for a check of the installation. The researchers
      evaluated how well the sensors were installed and asked the resident questions
      about the installation process to help improve the SHiB design. The results
      indicate strengths and weaknesses of the SHiB design. Indoor motion tracking
      sensors are installed with high success rate, low installation success rate was
      found for door sensors and setting up the Internet server.

TI  - Human Centred Design Considerations for Connected Health Devices for the Older
      Adult.
PG  - 245-81
AB  - Connected health devices are generally designed for unsupervised use, by
      non-healthcare professionals, facilitating independent control of the individuals
      own healthcare. Older adults are major users of such devices and are a population
      significantly increasing in size. This group presents challenges due to the wide 
      spectrum of capabilities and attitudes towards technology. The fit between
      capabilities of the user and demands of the device can be optimised in a process 
      called Human Centred Design. Here we review examples of some connected health
      devices chosen by random selection, assess older adult known capabilities and
      attitudes and finally make analytical recommendations for design approaches and
      design specifications.

TI  - Automated Assessment of Cognitive Health Using Smart Home Technologies.
PG  - 323-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this work is to develop intelligent systems to monitor
      the well being of individuals in their home environments. OBJECTIVE: This paper
      introduces a machine learning-based method to automatically predict activity
      quality in smart homes and automatically assess cognitive health based on
      activity quality. METHODS: This paper describes an automated framework to extract
      set of features from smart home sensors data that reflects the activity
      performance or ability of an individual to complete an activity which can be
      input to machine learning algorithms. Output from learning algorithms including
      principal component analysis, support vector machine, and logistic regression
      algorithms are used to quantify activity quality for a complex set of smart home 
      activities and predict cognitive health of participants. RESULTS: Smart home
      activity data was gathered from volunteer participants (n=263) who performed a
      complex set of activities in our smart home testbed. We compare our automated
      activity quality prediction and cognitive health prediction with direct
      observation scores and health assessment obtained from neuropsychologists. With
      all samples included, we obtained statistically significant correlation (r=0.54) 
      between direct observation scores and predicted activity quality. Similarly,
      using a support vector machine classifier, we obtained reasonable classification 
      accuracy (area under the ROC curve = 0.80, g-mean = 0.73) in classifying
      participants into two different cognitive classes, dementia and cognitive
      healthy. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that it is possible to automatically
      quantify the task quality of smart home activities and perform limited assessment
      of the cognitive health of individual if smart home activities are properly
      chosen and learning algorithms are appropriately trained.

TI  - Modeling Patterns of Activities using Activity Curves.
PG  - 51-68
AB  - Pervasive computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor 
      behavior and use the large amount of collected data to perform analysis of
      activity-based behavioral patterns. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an 
      activity curve, which represents an abstraction of an individual’s normal daily
      routine based on automatically-recognized activities. We propose methods to
      detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these 
      changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We
      demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a
      longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older
      adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics
      such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional
      health assessment. Our evaluation indicates that correlations do exist between
      behavior and health changes and that these changes can be automatically detected 
      using smart homes, machine learning, and big data-based pervasive analytics.

TI  - An Interactive Real-Time Locating System Based on Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacon
      Network †.
LID - 1637
AB  - The ubiquity of Bluetooth-enabled smartphones and peripherals has brought
      tremendous convenience to our daily life. In recent years, Bluetooth beacons have
      also been gaining popularity in implementing a variety of innovative
      location-based services such as self-guided systems in exhibition centers.
      However, the broadcast-based beacon technology can only provide unidirectional
      communication. In case smartphone users would like to respond to the beacon
      messages, they have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the 
      information back to the backend system. Nevertheless, mobile Internet services
      may not be always available or too costly. In this work, we develop a real-time
      locating system based only on the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to
      support interactive communications by combining the broadcast and mesh topology
      options to extend the applicability of beacon solutions. Specifically, we turn
      the smartphone into a beacon device and augment the beacon devices with the
      capability of forming a mesh network. The implementation result shows that our
      beacon devices can detect the presence of specific users at specific locations,
      and then the presence state can be sent to the application server via the relay
      of beacon devices. Moreover, the application server can send personalized
      location-based messages to the users, again via the relay of beacon devices. With
      the capability of relaying messages between the beacon devices, it would be
      convenient for developers to implement a variety of interactive applications such
      as tracking VIP customers at the airport, or tracking an elder with Alzheimer’s

TI  - Healthy ageing supported by technology – a cross-disciplinary research challenge.
PG  - 81-91
AB  - During the last decade, the challenges of an ageing society became focus for
      extensive scientific, public and political discussions. From discussions in
      scientific fora within each discipline, there is now a shift towards
      cross-disciplinary scientific approaches. The aim of this article is therefore,
      to collect and describe different scientific viewpoints in this regard and to
      point out research gaps to be addressed in the future. The article is based on a 
      number of review articles and keynote lectures given by the author, and
      complemented with informal interviews of experts from different scientific fields
      engaged in the field of technology and ageing. Results show that research has
      emerged from being technology-focussed to scenario-based taking different
      scientific perspectives into account. However, the biggest challenge still is to 
      accommodate the need for a holistic integrated service which means to provide
      personalised services and adapt technology and content to individual needs of
      different stakeholders. Further, cross-disciplinary research is needed that
      relates informatics and technology to different stages of the aging process and
      that evaluates the effects of proposed technical solutions.

TI  - A Review of Age Friendly Virtual Assistive Technologies and their Effect on Daily
      Living for Carers and Dependent Adults.
LID - 49
AB  - Many barriers exist in the lives of older adult’s, including health, transport,
      housing, isolation, disability and access to technology. The appropriate
      integration of technology within age-friendly communities continues to offer
      possible solutions to these barriers and challenges. Older adults and disabled
      people continue to be affected and marginalized due to lack of access to the
      digital world. Working collaboratively with planners, policy makers and
      developers, social and living spaces in the future will ensure that residents are
      equipped to live in an era that continues to be led by, and is dependent upon,
      access to technology. This review paper uniquely draws together the small volume 
      of literature from the fields of gerontology, gerontechnology, human computer
      interaction (HCI), and disability. This paper examines the national and
      international age-friendly frameworks regarding older adults who are carers of
      dependent people with disabilities.

TI  - Cognitive Inference Device for Activity Supervision in the Elderly.
LID - 125618
AB  - Human activity, life span, and quality of life are enhanced by innovations in
      science and technology. Aging individual needs to take advantage of these
      developments to lead a self-regulated life. However, maintaining a self-regulated
      life at old age involves a high degree of risk, and the elderly often fail at
      this goal. Thus, the objective of our study is to investigate the feasibility of 
      implementing a cognitive inference device (CI-device) for effective activity
      supervision in the elderly. To frame the CI-device, we propose a device design
      framework along with an inference algorithm and implement the designs through an 
      artificial neural model with different configurations, mapping the CI-device's
      functions to minimise the device's prediction error. An analysis and discussion
      are then provided to validate the feasibility of CI-device implementation for
      activity supervision in the elderly.

TI  - Patient Portal Use and Experience Among Older Adults: Systematic Review.
LID - e38
AB  - Background: The older adult population (65 years or older) in the United States
      is growing, and it is important for communities to consider ways to support the
      aging population. Patient portals and electronic personal health records (ePHRs) 
      are technologies that could better serve populations with the highest health care
      needs, such as older adults. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the
      existing research landscape related to patient portal and ePHR use and experience
      among older adults and to understand the benefits and barriers to older adults’
      use and adoption of patient portals and ePHRs. Methods: We searched six pertinent
      bibliographic databases for papers, published from 2006 to 2016 and written in
      English, that focused on adults 60 years or older and their use of or experience 
      with patient portals or ePHRs. We adapted preferred reporting items for
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to review papers based
      on exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then applied thematic analysis to
      identify key themes around use, experience, and adoption. Results: We retrieved
      199 papers after an initial screening and removal of duplicate papers. Then we
      applied an inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a final set of 17
      papers that focused on 15 separate projects. The majority of papers described
      studies involving qualitative research, including interviews and focus groups.
      They looked at the experience and use of ePHRs and patient portals. Overall, we
      found 2 main barriers to use: (1) privacy and security and (2) access to and
      ability to use technology and the Internet. We found 2 facilitators: (1)
      technical assistance and (2) family and provider advice. We also reported on
      older adults’ experience, including satisfaction with the system and improvement 
      of the quality of their health care. Several studies captured features that older
      adults wanted from these systems such as further assistance managing
      health-related tasks and contextual health advice and tips. Conclusions: More
      research is needed to better understand the patient portal experience among older
      adults from initial use to adoption. There are also opportunities to explore the 
      role of design in addressing barriers and supporting facilitators to patient
      portal and ePHR use. Finally, the future use of these systems by older adults
      should be anticipated and considered in the design process.

TI  - Ubiquitous Monitoring of Electrical Household Appliances.
PG  - 12159-5191
AB  - The number of appliances at home is increasing continuously, mainly because they 
      make our lives easier. Currently, technology is integrated in all objects of our 
      daily life. TCP/IP let us monitor our home in real time and check ubiquitously if
      something is happening at home. Bearing in mind this idea, we have developed a
      low-cost system, which can be used in any type of electrical household appliance 
      that takes information from the appliance and posts the information to the
      Twitter Social network. Several sensors placed in the household appliances gather
      the sensed data and send them wired or wirelessly, depending on the case, using
      small and cheap devices to a gateway located in the home. This gateway takes
      decisions, based on the received data, and sends notifications to Twitter. We
      have developed a software application that takes the values and decides when to
      issue an alarm to the registered users (Twitter friends of our smart home). The
      performance of our system has been measured taking into account the home network 
      (using IEEE 802.3u and IEEE 802.11g) and the data publishing in Twitter. As a
      result, we have generated an original product and service for any electrical
      household appliance, regardless of the model and manufacturer, that helps home
      users improve their quality of life. The paper also shows that there is no system
      with the same innovative features like the ones presented in this paper.

TI  - SmartFall: A Smartwatch-Based Fall Detection System Using Deep Learning.
LID - 3363
AB  - This paper presents SmartFall, an Android app that uses accelerometer data
      collected from a commodity-based smartwatch Internet of Things (IoT) device to
      detect falls. The smartwatch is paired with a smartphone that runs the SmartFall 
      application, which performs the computation necessary for the prediction of falls
      in real time without incurring latency in communicating with a cloud server,
      while also preserving data privacy. We experimented with both traditional
      (Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) and non-traditional (Deep Learning)
      machine learning algorithms for the creation of fall detection models using three
      different fall datasets (Smartwatch, Notch, Farseeing). Our results show that a
      Deep Learning model for fall detection generally outperforms more traditional
      models across the three datasets. This is attributed to the Deep Learning model’s
      ability to automatically learn subtle features from the raw accelerometer data
      that are not available to Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, which are
      restricted to learning from a small set of extracted features manually specified.
      Furthermore, the Deep Learning model exhibits a better ability to generalize to
      new users when predicting falls, an important quality of any model that is to be 
      successful in the real world. We also present a three-layer open IoT system
      architecture used in SmartFall, which can be easily adapted for the collection
      and analysis of other sensor data modalities (e.g., heart rate, skin temperature,
      walking patterns) that enables remote monitoring of a subject’s wellbeing.

TI  - A Smart Home System for Information Sharing, Health Assessments, and Medication
      Self-Management for Older People: Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Study.
LID - e12447
AB  - Background: Older adults often want to stay in a familiar place, such as their
      home, as they get older. This so-called aging in place, which may involve support
      from relatives or care professionals, can promote older people’s independence and
      well-being. The combination of aging and disease, however, can lead to complex
      medication regimes and difficulties for care providers in correctly assessing the
      older person's health. In addition, the organization of health care is
      fragmented, which makes it difficult for health professionals to encourage older 
      people to participate in their own care. It is also a challenge to perform
      adequate health assessments and to engage in appropriate communication between
      health care professionals. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to describe
      the design for an integrated home-based system that can acquire and compile
      health-related evidence for guidance and information-sharing among care providers
      and care receivers in order to support and promote medication self-management
      among older people. Methods: The authors used a participatory design approach for
      this mixed-methods project, which was divided into four phases. Phase I,
      Conceptualization, consists of the conceptualization of a system to support
      medication self-management, objective health assessments, and communication
      between health care professionals. Phase II, Development of a System, consists of
      building and bringing together the conceptualized systems from Phase I. Phase
      III, Pilot Study, and Phase IV, Full-Scale Intervention, are described briefly.
      Results: Participants in Phase I were people who were involved in some way in the
      care of older adults and included older adults themselves, relatives of older
      adults, care professionals, and industrial partners. With input from Phase I
      participants, we identified two relevant concepts for promoting medication
      self-management, both of which related to systems that participants believed
      could provide guidance for the older adults themselves, relatives of older
      adults, and care professionals. The systems will also encourage
      information-sharing between care providers and care receivers. The first is the
      concept of the Intelligent Age-Friendly Home (IAFH), defined as an integrated
      residential system that evolves to sense, reason, and act in response to
      individuals’ needs, preferences, and behaviors as these change over time. The
      second concept is the Medication safety, Objective assessments of health-related 
      behaviors, and Personalized medication reminders (MedOP) system, a system that
      would be supported by the IAFH, and which consists of three related components:
      one that assesses health behaviors, another that communicates health data, and a 
      third that promotes medication self-management. Conclusions: The participants in 
      this project were older adults, relatives of older adults, care professionals,
      and our industrial partners. With input from the participants, we identified two 
      main concepts that could comprise a system for health assessment, communication, 
      and medication self-management: the IAFH and the MedOP system. These concepts
      will be tested in this study to determine whether they can facilitate and promote
      medication self-management among older people. International Registered Report

TI  - Application of Modified PageRank Algorithm for Anomaly Detection in Movements of 
      Older Adults.
LID - 8612021
AB  - It is a well-known statistic that the percentage of our older adult population
      will globally surpass the other age groups. A majority of the elderly would still
      prefer to keep an active life style. In support of this life style, various
      monitoring systems are being designed and deployed to have a seamless integration
      with the daily living activities of the older adults while preserving various
      levels of their privacy. Motion tracking is one of these health monitoring
      systems. When properly designed, deployed, integrated, and analyzed, they can be 
      used to assist in determining some onsets of anomalies in the health of elderly
      at various levels of their Movements and Activities of Daily Living (MADL). This 
      paper explores how the framework of the PageRank algorithm can be extended for
      monitoring the global movement patterns of older adults at their place of
      residence. Through utilization of an existing dataset, the paper shows how the
      movement patterns between various rooms can be represented as a directed graph
      with weighted edges. To demonstrate how PageRank can be utilized, a base graph
      representing a normal pattern can be defined as what can be used for further
      anomaly detection (e.g., at some instances of observation the measured movement
      pattern deviates from what is previously defined as a normal pattern). It is
      shown how the PageRank algorithm can detect simulated change in the pattern of
      motion when compared with the base-line normal pattern. This feature can offer a 
      practical approach for detecting anomalies in movement patterns associated with
      older adults in their own place of residence and in support of aging in place
      paradigm.

TI  - A Low-Cost Indoor Activity Monitoring System for Detecting Frailty in Older
      Adults.
LID - 452
AB  - Indoor localization systems have already wide applications mainly for providing
      localized information and directions. The majority of them focus on commercial
      applications providing information such us advertisements, guidance and asset
      tracking. Medical oriented localization systems are uncommon. Given the fact that
      an individual’s indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status, in
      this paper we present a low-cost indoor localization system with room-level
      accuracy used to assess the frailty of older people. We focused on designing a
      system with easy installation and low cost to be used by non technical staff. The
      system was installed in older people houses in order to collect data about their 
      indoor localization habits. The collected data were examined in combination with 
      their frailty status, showing a correlation between them. The indoor localization
      system is based on the processing of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
      measurements by a tracking device, from Bluetooth Beacons, using a
      fingerprint-based procedure. The system has been tested in realistic settings
      achieving accuracy above 93% in room estimation. The proposed system was used in 
      271 houses collecting data for 1–7-day sessions. The evaluation of the collected 
      data using ten-fold cross-validation showed an accuracy of 83% in the
      classification of a monitored person regarding his/her frailty status (Frail,
      Pre-frail, Non-frail).

TI  - Data Mining for Wearable Sensors in Health Monitoring Systems: A Review of Recent
      Trends and Challenges.
PG  - 17472-500
AB  - The past few years have witnessed an increase in the development of wearable
      sensors for health monitoring systems. This increase has been due to several
      factors such as development in sensor technology as well as directed efforts on
      political and stakeholder levels to promote projects which address the need for
      providing new methods for care given increasing challenges with an aging
      population. An important aspect of study in such system is how the data is
      treated and processed. This paper provides a recent review of the latest methods 
      and algorithms used to analyze data from wearable sensors used for physiological 
      monitoring of vital signs in healthcare services. In particular, the paper
      outlines the more common data mining tasks that have been applied such as anomaly
      detection, prediction and decision making when considering in particular
      continuous time series measurements. Moreover, the paper further details the
      suitability of particular data mining and machine learning methods used to
      process the physiological data and provides an overview of the properties of the 
      data sets used in experimental validation. Finally, based on this literature
      review, a number of key challenges have been outlined for data mining methods in 
      health monitoring systems.

TI  - SynSys: A Synthetic Data Generation System for Healthcare Applications.
LID - 1181
AB  - Creation of realistic synthetic behavior-based sensor data is an important aspect
      of testing machine learning techniques for healthcare applications. Many of the
      existing approaches for generating synthetic data are often limited in terms of
      complexity and realism. We introduce SynSys, a machine learning-based synthetic
      data generation method, to improve upon these limitations. We use this method to 
      generate synthetic time series data that is composed of nested sequences using
      hidden Markov models and regression models which are initially trained on real
      datasets. We test our synthetic data generation technique on a real annotated
      smart home dataset. We use time series distance measures as a baseline to
      determine how realistic the generated data is compared to real data and
      demonstrate that SynSys produces more realistic data in terms of distance
      compared to random data generation, data from another home, and data from another
      time period. Finally, we apply our synthetic data generation technique to the
      problem of generating data when only a small amount of ground truth data is
      available. Using semi-supervised learning we demonstrate that SynSys is able to
      improve activity recognition accuracy compared to using the small amount of real 
      data alone.

TI  - Rethinking Family-Centred Design Approach Towards Creating Digital Products and
      Services.
LID - 1232
AB  - This article provides further study of a family-centred design approach model
      established in previous studies, which aims to correspond to the limitations and 
      needs of modern families using information and communication technology (ICT)
      solutions for common activities, communication and organisation of family time.
      The ambition is to systematically define and design features (functionalities) of
      a prototype solution that connects family members; provides proper communication;
      promotes active quality family time, active life, a health-friendly lifestyle and
      well-being; and uses various sensor- and user-based data sources through a smart 
      city ecosystem platform. The original approach model was applied in designing the
      MyFamily progressive web application prototype solution as part of the EkoSmart: 
      Active Living and Well-Being Project (RRP3) funded by the Republic of Slovenia
      and the European Regional Development Fund Investing in Your Future program.
      Extensive testing of the prototype solution used and the triangulation method
      used within thematic analysis for user interviews provide new insights and
      proposals for the change of the family-centred design approach model in the form 
      of distinct developmental goals narrative for each generation to enhance
      motivation and relevance of content to different generations of users of such
      digital solutions.

TI  - Aging Well: Using Precision to Drive Down Costs and Increase Health Quality.
LID - e190003
AB  - Efforts to provide patients with individualized treatments have led to tremendous
      breakthroughs in healthcare. However, a precision medicine approach alone will
      not offset the rapid increase in prevalence and burden of chronic
      non-communicable illnesses that is continuing to pervade the world’s aging
      population. With rapid advances in technology, it is now possible to collect
      digital metrics to assess, monitor and detect chronic disease indicators, much
      earlier in the disease course, potentially redefining what was previously
      considered asymptomatic to pre-symptomatic. Data science and artificial
      intelligence can drive the discovery of digital biomarkers before the emergence
      of overt clinical symptoms, thereby transforming the current healthcare approach 
      from one centered on precision medicine to a more comprehensive focus on
      precision health, and by doing so enable the possibility of preventing disease
      altogether. Presented herein are the challenges to the current healthcare model
      and the proposition of first steps for reversing the prevailing intractable trend
      of rising healthcare costs and poorer health quality.

TI  - Acceptance and Use of Health Information Technology By Community-Dwelling Elders.
PG  - 624-35
AB  - Objectives: With the worldwide population growing in age, information technology 
      may help meet important needs to prepare and support patients and families for
      aging. We sought to explore the use and acceptance of information technology for 
      health among the elderly by reviewing the existing literature. Methods: Review of
      literature using PubMed and Google Scholar, references from relevant papers, and 
      consultation with experts. Results: Elderly people approach the Internet and
      health information technology differently than younger people, but have growing
      rates of adoption. Assistive technology, such as sensors or home monitors, may
      help ‘aging in place,' but these have not been thoroughly evaluated. Elders face 
      many barriers to using technology for healthcare decision-making, including
      issues with familiarity, willingness to ask for help, trust of the technology,
      privacy, and design challenges. Conclusions: Barriers must be addressed for these
      tools to be available to this growing population. Design, education, research,
      and policy all play roles in addressing these barriers to acceptance and use.

TI  - Monitoring Methods of Human Body Joints: State-of-the-Art and Research
      Challenges.
LID - 2629
AB  - The world’s population is aging: the expansion of the older adult population with
      multiple physical and health issues is now a huge socio-economic concern
      worldwide. Among these issues, the loss of mobility among older adults due to
      musculoskeletal disorders is especially serious as it has severe social, mental
      and physical consequences. Human body joint monitoring and early diagnosis of
      these disorders will be a strong and effective solution to this problem. A smart 
      joint monitoring system can identify and record important musculoskeletal-related
      parameters. Such devices can be utilized for continuous monitoring of joint
      movements during the normal daily activities of older adults and the healing
      process of joints (hips, knees or ankles) during the post-surgery period. A
      viable monitoring system can be developed by combining miniaturized, durable,
      low-cost and compact sensors with the advanced communication technologies and
      data processing techniques. In this study, we have presented and compared
      different joint monitoring methods and sensing technologies recently reported. A 
      discussion on sensors’ data processing, interpretation, and analysis techniques
      is also presented. Finally, current research focus, as well as future prospects
      and development challenges in joint monitoring systems are discussed.

TI  - Legislative and ethical aspects of introducing new technologies in medical care
      for senior citizens in developed countries.
PG  - 977-84
AB  - Introduction: The majority of developed countries are currently experiencing
      demographic aging. The most frequently expressed concerns related to the changing
      age structure are the increased costs of social and medical care, a lack of labor
      force in the job market, and financial sustainability of the pension system.
      These concerns are often based on the pessimistic view of population aging. This 
      view understands aging as a prolonged period of illness and suffering. On the
      other hand, optimists believe that a longer life span is a result of increased
      quality of life and better health care. The quality of life may be improved not
      only by medicaments, but also by rapidly developing area of medical devices,
      which allow better care for seniors in many areas. Aim: This contribution aims to
      assess the legislative environment and ethical questions related to the use of
      medical devices, especially medical devices, in medical care for senior citizens.
      Methods: The methods used in this study are literature reviews of legislative and
      ethical environment in the European Union (EU) and the US. Results: Main findings
      of this study result from assessing the state of medical device regulations in
      Europe and the US. Namely, the US regulation seems to be better arranged, which
      is probably due to the fact that there is only one responsible body – the US Food
      and Drug Administration, which is responsible for all medical device regulations.
      On the other hand, in the EU, talks about new legislation are led by ministers
      from all the EU member states and it may take a long time before all the EU
      countries come to an agreement.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network-Based Embarrassing Situation Detection under Camera 
      for Social Robot in Smart Homes.
LID - 1530
AB  - Recent research has shown that the ubiquitous use of cameras and voice monitoring
      equipment in a home environment can raise privacy concerns and affect human
      mental health. This can be a major obstacle to the deployment of smart home
      systems for elderly or disabled care. This study uses a social robot to detect
      embarrassing situations. Firstly, we designed an improved neural network
      structure based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to obtain feature
      information. By focusing on reducing area redundancy and computation time, we
      proposed a bounding-box merging algorithm based on region proposal networks
      (B-RPN), to merge the areas that have similar features and determine the borders 
      of the bounding box. Thereafter, we designed a feature extraction algorithm based
      on our improved YOLO and B-RPN, called F-YOLO, for our training datasets, and
      then proposed a real-time object detection algorithm based on F-YOLO (RODA-FY).
      We implemented RODA-FY and compared models on our MAT social robot. Secondly, we 
      considered six types of situations in smart homes, and developed training and
      validation datasets, containing 2580 and 360 images, respectively. Meanwhile, we 
      designed three types of experiments with four types of test datasets composed of 
      960 sample images. Thirdly, we analyzed how a different number of training
      iterations affects our prediction estimation, and then we explored the
      relationship between recognition accuracy and learning rates. Our results show
      that our proposed privacy detection system can recognize designed situations in
      the smart home with an acceptable recognition accuracy of 94.48%. Finally, we
      compared the results among RODA-FY, Inception V3, and YOLO, which indicate that
      our proposed RODA-FY outperforms the other comparison models in recognition
      accuracy.

TI  - Understanding Smart Home Sensor Data for Ageing in Place Through Everyday
      Household Routines: A Mixed Method Case Study.
LID - e52
AB  - Background: An ongoing challenge for smart homes research for aging-in-place is
      how to make sense of the large amounts of data from in-home sensors to facilitate
      real-time monitoring and develop reliable alerts. Objective: The objective of our
      study was to explore the usefulness of a routine-based approach for making sense 
      of smart home data for the elderly. Methods: Maximum variation sampling was used 
      to select three cases for an in-depth mixed methods exploration of the daily
      routines of three elderly participants in a smart home trial using 180 days of
      power use and motion sensor data and longitudinal interview data. Results: Sensor
      data accurately matched self-reported routines. By comparing daily movement data 
      with personal routines, it was possible to identify changes in routine that
      signaled illness, recovery from bereavement, and gradual deterioration of sleep
      quality and daily movement. Interview and sensor data also identified changes in 
      routine with variations in temperature and daylight hours. Conclusions: The
      findings demonstrated that a routine-based approach makes interpreting sensor
      data easy, intuitive, and transparent. They highlighted the importance of
      understanding and accounting for individual differences in preferences for
      routinization and the influence of the cyclical nature of daily routines, social 
      or cultural rhythms, and seasonal changes in temperature and daylight hours when 
      interpreting information based on sensor data. This research has demonstrated the
      usefulness of a routine-based approach for making sense of smart home data, which
      has furthered the understanding of the challenges that need to be addressed in
      order to make real-time monitoring and effective alerts a reality.

TI  - Location Estimation in a Smart Home: System Implementation and Evaluation Using
      Experimental Data.
LID - 142803
AB  - In the context of a constantly increasing aging population with cognitive
      deficiencies, insuring the autonomy of the elders at home becomes a priority. The
      DOMUS laboratory is addressing this issue by conceiving a smart home which can
      both assist people and preserve their quality of life. Obviously, the ability to 
      monitor properly the occupant's activities and thus provide the pertinent
      assistance depends highly on location information inside the smart home. This
      paper proposes a solution to localize the occupant thanks to Bayesian filtering
      and a set of anonymous sensors disseminated throughout the house. The
      localization system is designed for a single person inside the house. It could
      however be used in conjunction with other localization systems in case more
      people are present. Our solution is functional in real conditions. We conceived
      an experiment to estimate precisely its accuracy and evaluate its robustness. The
      experiment consists of a scenario of daily routine meant to maximize the
      occupant's motion in meaningful activities. It was performed by 14 subjects, one 
      subject at a time. The results are satisfactory: the system's accuracy exceeds
      85% and is independent of the occupant's profile. The system works in real time
      and behaves well in presence of noise.

TI  - A Social Virtual Reality-Based Application for the Physical and Cognitive
      Training of the Elderly at Home.
LID - 261
AB  - Frailty is a clinical condition affecting the elderly population which results in
      an increased risk of falls. Previous studies demonstrated that falls prevention
      programs are effective, but they suffer from low adherence, especially when
      subjects have to train unsupervised in their homes. To try to improve treatment
      adherence, virtual reality and social media have been proposed as promising
      strategies for the increase of users’ motivation and thus their willingness to
      practice. In the context of smart homes, this work presents SocialBike, a virtual
      reality-based application aimed at improving the clinical outcomes of older frail
      adults in their houses. Indeed, SocialBike is integrated in the “house of the
      future” framework and proposes a Dual Task training program in which the users
      are required to cycle on a stationary bike while recognizing target animals or
      objects appearing along the way. It also implements the possibility of training
      with other users, thus reducing the risk of social isolation. Within SocialBike, 
      users can choose the multiplayer mode they prefer (i.e., collaborative or
      competitive), and are allowed to train following their own attitude. SocialBike’s
      validation, refinement, and business model are currently under development, and
      are briefly discussed as future works.

TI  - Flexibility Support for Homecare Applications Based on Models and Multi-Agent
      Technology.
PG  - 31939-64
AB  - In developed countries, public health systems are under pressure due to the
      increasing percentage of population over 65. In this context, homecare based on
      ambient intelligence technology seems to be a suitable solution to allow elderly 
      people to continue to enjoy the comforts of home and help optimize medical
      resources. Thus, current technological developments make it possible to build
      complex homecare applications that demand, among others, flexibility mechanisms
      for being able to evolve as context does (adaptability), as well as avoiding
      service disruptions in the case of node failure (availability). The solution
      proposed in this paper copes with these flexibility requirements through the
      whole life-cycle of the target applications: from design phase to runtime. The
      proposed domain modeling approach allows medical staff to design customized
      applications, taking into account the adaptability needs. It also guides software
      developers during system implementation. The application execution is managed by 
      a multi-agent based middleware, making it possible to meet adaptation
      requirements, assuring at the same time the availability of the system even for
      stateful applications.

TI  - Origins and consequences of technology acquirement by independent-living seniors:
      towards an integrative model.
LID - 189
AB  - Background: Living independently can be challenging for seniors. Technologies are
      expected to help older adults age in place, yet little empirical research is
      available on how seniors develop a need for technologies, how they acquire these 
      technologies, and how these subsequently affect their lives. Aging is complex,
      dynamic and personal. But how does this translate to seniors’ adoption and
      acceptance of technology? To better understand origins and consequences of
      technology acquirement by independent-living seniors, an explorative longitudinal
      qualitative field study was set up. Methods: Home visits were made to 33
      community-dwelling seniors living in the Netherlands, on three occasions
      (2012–2014). Semi-structured interviews were conducted on the timeline of
      acquirements, and people and factors involved in acquirements. Additionally,
      participants were interviewed on experiences in using technologies since
      acquirement. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts,
      using a realist approach to better understand the contexts, mechanisms and
      outcomes of technology acquirements. Results: Findings were accumulated in a new 
      conceptual model: The Cycle of Technology Acquirement by Independent-Living
      Seniors (C-TAILS), which provides an integrative perspective on why and how
      technologies are acquired, and why these may or may not prove to be appropriate
      and effective, considering an independent-living senior’s needs and circumstances
      at a given point in time. We found that externally driven and purely
      desire-driven acquirements led to a higher risk of suboptimal use and low levels 
      of need satisfaction. Conclusions: Technology acquirement by independent-living
      seniors may be best characterized as a heterogeneous process with many different 
      origins, pathways and consequences. Furthermore, technologies that are acquired
      in ways that are not congruent with seniors’ personal needs and circumstances run
      a higher risk of proving to be ineffective or inappropriate. Yet, these needs and
      circumstances are subject to change, and the C-TAILS model can be employed to
      better understand contexts and mechanisms that come into play.

TI  - PHAROS—PHysical Assistant RObot System.
LID - 2633
AB  - The great demographic change leading to an ageing society demands technological
      solutions to satisfy the increasing varied elderly needs. This paper presents
      PHAROS, an interactive robot system that recommends and monitors physical
      exercises designed for the elderly. The aim of PHAROS is to be a friendly elderly
      companion that periodically suggests personalised physical activities, promoting 
      healthy living and active ageing. Here, it is presented the PHAROS architecture, 
      components and experimental results. The architecture has three main strands: a
      Pepper robot, that interacts with the users and records their exercises
      performance; the Human Exercise Recognition, that uses the Pepper recorded
      information to classify the exercise performed using Deep Leaning methods; and
      the Recommender, a smart-decision maker that schedules periodically personalised 
      physical exercises in the users’ agenda. The experimental results show a high
      accuracy in terms of detecting and classifying the physical exercises (97.35%)
      done by 7 persons. Furthermore, we have implemented a novel procedure of rating
      exercises on the recommendation algorithm. It closely follows the users’ health
      status (poor performance may reveal health problems) and adapts the suggestions
      to it. The history may be used to access the physical condition of the user,
      revealing underlying problems that may be impossible to see otherwise.

TI  - A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Motion Sensor Placement in Smart Environments.
PG  - 3-16
AB  - Smart environments and ubiquitous computing technologies hold great promise for a
      wide range of real world applications. The medical community is particularly
      interested in high quality measurement of activities of daily living. With
      accurate computer modeling of older adults, decision support tools may be built
      to assist care providers. One aspect of effectively deploying these technologies 
      is determining where the sensors should be placed in the home to effectively
      support these end goals. This work introduces and evaluates a set of approaches
      for generating sensor layouts in the home. These approaches range from the gold
      standard of human intuition-based placement to more advanced search algorithms,
      including Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithms. The generated layouts are
      evaluated based on their ability to detect activities while minimizing the number
      of needed sensors. Sensor-rich environments can provide valuable insights about
      adults as they go about their lives. These sensors, once in place, provide
      information on daily behavior that can facilitate an aging-in-place approach to
      health care.

TI  - Technology-Based Innovations to Foster Personalized Healthy Lifestyles and
      Well-Being: A Targeted Review.
LID - e128
AB  - Background: New community-based arrangements and novel technologies can empower
      individuals to be active participants in their health maintenance, enabling
      people to control and self-regulate their health and wellness and make better
      health- and lifestyle-related decisions. Mobile sensing technology and health
      systems responsive to individual profiles combined with cloud computing can
      expand innovation for new types of interoperable services that are
      consumer-oriented and community-based. This could fuel a paradigm shift in the
      way health care can be, or should be, provided and received, while lessening the 
      burden on exhausted health and social care systems. Objective: Our goal is to
      identify and discuss the main scientific and engineering challenges that need to 
      be successfully addressed in delivering state-of-the-art, ubiquitous eHealth and 
      mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness management services, and
      reposition their role and potential within a broader context of diverse
      sociotechnical drivers, agents, and stakeholders. Methods: We review the
      state-of-the-art relevant to the development and implementation of eHealth and
      mHealth services in critical domains. We identify and discuss scientific,
      engineering, and implementation-related challenges that need to be overcome to
      move research, development, and the market forward. Results: Several important
      advances have been identified in the fields of systems for personalized health
      monitoring, such as smartphone platforms and intelligent ubiquitous services.
      Sensors embedded in smartphones and clothes are making the unobtrusive
      recognition of physical activity, behavior, and lifestyle possible, and thus the 
      deployment of platforms for health assistance and citizen empowerment. Similarly,
      significant advances are observed in the domain of infrastructure supporting
      services. Still, many technical problems remain to be solved, combined with no
      less challenging issues related to security, privacy, trust, and organizational
      dynamics. Conclusions: Delivering innovative ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth
      services, including citizen-centered wellness and lifestyle management services, 
      goes well beyond the development of technical solutions. For the large-scale
      information and communication technology-supported adoption of healthier
      lifestyles to take place, crucial innovations are needed in the process of making
      and deploying usable empowering end-user services that are trusted and
      user-acceptable. Such innovations require multidomain, multilevel,
      transdisciplinary work, grounded in theory but driven by citizens’ and health
      care professionals’ needs, expectations, and capabilities and matched by business
      ability to bring innovation to the market.

TI  - Wearable Health Devices—Vital Sign Monitoring, Systems and Technologies.
LID - 2414
AB  - Wearable Health Devices (WHDs) are increasingly helping people to better monitor 
      their health status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking
      and at a medical level providing more data to clinicians with a potential for
      earlier diagnostic and guidance of treatment. The technology revolution in the
      miniaturization of electronic devices is enabling to design more reliable and
      adaptable wearables, contributing for a world-wide change in the health
      monitoring approach. In this paper we review important aspects in the WHDs area, 
      listing the state-of-the-art of wearable vital signs sensing technologies plus
      their system architectures and specifications. A focus on vital signs acquired by
      WHDs is made: first a discussion about the most important vital signs for health 
      assessment using WHDs is presented and then for each vital sign a description is 
      made concerning its origin and effect on heath, monitoring needs, acquisition
      methods and WHDs and recent scientific developments on the area
      (electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, blood oxygen
      saturation, blood glucose, skin perspiration, capnography, body temperature,
      motion evaluation, cardiac implantable devices and ambient parameters). A general
      WHDs system architecture is presented based on the state-of-the-art. After a
      global review of WHDs, we zoom in into cardiovascular WHDs, analysing commercial 
      devices and their applicability versus quality, extending this subject to smart
      t-shirts for medical purposes. Furthermore we present a resumed evolution of
      these devices based on the prototypes developed along the years. Finally we
      discuss likely market trends and future challenges for the emerging WHDs area.

TI  - Framing the evidence for health smart homes and home-based consumer health
      technologies as a public health intervention for independent aging: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 565-79
AB  - Introduction: There is a critical need for public health interventions to support
      the independence of older adults as the world’s population ages. Health smart
      homes (HSH) and home-based consumer health (HCH) technologies may play a role in 
      these interventions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of HSH and HCH
      literature from indexed repositories for health care and technology disciplines
      (e.g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore) and classified included studies
      according to an evidence-based public health (EBPH) typology. Results: One
      thousand, six hundred and thirty nine candidate articles were identified.
      Thirty-one studies from the years 1998–2011 were included. Twenty-one included
      studies were classified as emerging, 10 as promising and 3 as effective (first
      tier). Conclusion: The majority of included studies were published in the period 
      beginning in the year 2005. All 3 effective (first tier) studies and 9 of 10 of
      promising studies were published during this period. Almost all studies included 
      an activity sensing component and most of these used passive infrared motion
      sensors. The three effective (first tier) studies all used a multicomponent
      technology approach that included activity sensing, reminders and other
      technologies tailored to individual preferences. Future research should explore
      the use of technology for self-management of health by older adults, social
      support and self-reported health measures incorporated into personal health
      records, electronic medical records, and community health registries.

TI  - The Importance of Trust in the Adoption and Use of Intelligent Assistive
      Technology by Older Adults to Support Aging in Place: Scoping Review Protocol.
LID - e218
AB  - Background: Intelligent assistive technologies that complement and extend human
      abilities have proliferated in recent years. Service robots, home automation
      equipment, and other digital assistant devices possessing artificial intelligence
      are forms of assistive technologies that have become popular in society. Older
      adults (>55 years of age) have been identified by industry, government, and
      researchers as a demographic who can benefit significantly from the use of
      intelligent assistive technology to support various activities of daily living.
      Objective: The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the literature on
      the importance of the concept of “trust” in the adoption of intelligent assistive
      technologies to assist aging in place by older adults. Methods: Using a scoping
      review methodology, our search strategy will examine the following databases: ACM
      Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, PsycINFO,
      Scopus, and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently screen the initial
      titles obtained from the search, and these results will be further inspected by
      other members of the research team for inclusion in the review. Results: This
      review will provide insights into how the concept of trust is actualized in the
      adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults. Preliminary
      sensitization to the literature suggests that the concept of trust is fluid,
      unstable, and intimately tied to the type of intelligent assistive technology
      being examined. Furthermore, a wide range of theoretical lenses that include
      elements of trust have been used to examine this concept. Conclusions: This
      review will describe the concept of trust in the adoption of intelligent
      assistive technology by older adults, and will provide insights for
      practitioners, policy makers, and technology vendors for future practice.

TI  - Medicaid Becomes the First Third-Party Payer to Cover Passive Remote Monitoring
      for Home Care: Policy Analysis.
LID - e66
AB  - Background: Recent years have seen an influx of location-tracking,
      activity-monitoring sensors, and Web-cameras to remotely monitor the safety of
      older adults in their homes and to reduce reliance on in-person assistance. The
      state of research on these monitoring technologies leaves open crucial financial,
      social, and ethical cost-benefit questions, which have prevented widespread use. 
      Medicaid is now the first large third-party payer in the United States to pay for
      these technologies, and their use is likely to increase as states transition to
      managed long-term services and supports (MLTSS). Objectives: This is the first
      study to examine how state Medicaid programs are treating passive remote
      monitoring technologies. This study identifies (1) which states allow location
      tracking, sensor systems, and cameras; (2) what policies are in place to track
      their use; (3) what implementation processes and program monitoring mechanisms
      are in place; and (4) what related insights Medicaid program stakeholders would
      like to learn from researchers. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 43 state,
      federal, and managed care organization (MCO) Medicaid program stakeholders about 
      how these technologies are used in state waivers serving community-dwelling older
      adults in 15 states, and what policies are in place to regulate them. The
      interviews were analyzed by the research team using the framework analysis method
      for applied policy research. Results: Two-thirds of the states cover location
      tracking and activity-monitoring sensors and one-third cover cameras, but only 3 
      states have specific service categories that allow them to track when they are
      paying for any of these technologies, impeding regulation and understanding of
      their use at the state and federal level. Consideration of ethical and social
      risks is limited, and states struggle to understand which circumstances warrant
      use. They are further challenged by extreme resource restrictions and transitions
      to MLTSS by MCOs inexperienced in serving this growing “high-need, high-cost”
      population. Conclusions: Decisions about Medicaid reimbursement of technologies
      that have the potential to dramatically alter the way older adults receive
      supportive services are being made without research on their use, social and
      ethical implications, or outcomes. At a minimum, new service categories are
      needed to enable oversight. Participants prioritized 3 research aims to inform
      practice: (1) determine cost-effectiveness; (2) identify what type of information
      beneficiaries want to be generated and whom they want it to be shared with; and
      (3) understand how to support ethical decision making for beneficiaries with
      cognitive impairment. These findings provide direction for future research and
      reveal that greater interaction between policy makers and researchers in this
      field is needed.

TI  - Automated Cognitive Health Assessment Using Smart Home Monitoring of Complex
      Tasks.
PG  - 1302-13
AB  - One of the many services that intelligent systems can provide is the automated
      assessment of resident well-being. We hypothesize that the functional health of
      individuals, or ability of individuals to perform activities independently
      without assistance, can be estimated by tracking their activities using smart
      home technologies. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based method
      for assessing activity quality in smart homes. To validate our approach we
      quantify activity quality for 179 volunteer participants who performed a complex,
      interweaved set of activities in our smart home apartment. We observed a
      statistically significant correlation (r=0.79) between automated assessment of
      task quality and direct observation scores. Using machine learning techniques to 
      predict the cognitive health of the participants based on task quality is
      accomplished with an AUC value of 0.64. We believe that this capability is an
      important step in understanding everyday functional health of individuals in
      their home environments.

TI  - MEMS Sensor Technologies for Human Centred Applications in Healthcare, Physical
      Activities, Safety and Environmental Sensing: A Review on Research Activities in 
      Italy.
PG  - 6441-68
AB  - Over the past few decades the increased level of public awareness concerning
      healthcare, physical activities, safety and environmental sensing has created an 
      emerging need for smart sensor technologies and monitoring devices able to sense,
      classify, and provide feedbacks to users’ health status and physical activities, 
      as well as to evaluate environmental and safety conditions in a pervasive,
      accurate and reliable fashion. Monitoring and precisely quantifying users’
      physical activity with inertial measurement unit-based devices, for instance, has
      also proven to be important in health management of patients affected by chronic 
      diseases, e.g., Parkinson’s disease, many of which are becoming highly prevalent 
      in Italy and in the Western world. This review paper will focus on MEMS sensor
      technologies developed in Italy in the last three years describing research
      achievements for healthcare and physical activity, safety and environmental
      sensing, in addition to smart systems integration. Innovative and smart
      integrated solutions for sensing devices, pursued and implemented in Italian
      research centres, will be highlighted, together with specific applications of
      such technologies. Finally, the paper will depict the future perspective of
      sensor technologies and corresponding exploitation opportunities, again with a
      specific focus on Italy.

TI  - Hospital Real-Time Location System (A Practical Approach in Healthcare): A
      Narrative Review Article.
PG  - 593-602
AB  - Background:: The Hospital Real-time Location Systems (HRTLS), deal with
      monitoring the patients, medical staff and valuable medical equipment in
      emergency situations. Therefore, the study aimed to propose Hospital Real-Time
      Location Systems based on the novel technologies in Iran. Methods:: In this
      narrative-review, the articles and official reports on HRTLS, were gathered and
      analyzed from related textbooks and indexing sites with the defined keywords in
      English or Persian. The search of databases such as IDTechEx, IEEE, PubMed
      Central, Science Direct, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, Scopus, Web of Science, Elsevier
      journals, WHO publications and Google Scholar was performed to reconfirm the
      efficiency of HRTLS from 2006 to 2017. Results:: Various technologies have been
      used in the current systems, which have led to the reduced error rate, costs and 
      increased speed of providing the healthcare services. Applications of these
      systems include tracking of patient’s, medical staff and valuable medical assets.
      Besides, achieving the patient & staff satisfaction is among other basic
      applications of these Systems. The accurate data exchange and processes control
      are considered as positive aspects of this technology. Conclusion:: HRTLS has
      great importance in healthcare systems and its efficiency in medical centers is
      reliable; hence, it seems necessary to determine the organization’s requirements,
      apply novel technologies such as cloud computing and Internet of things, and
      integrate them to get access to maximum advantages in Iranian healthcare centers.

TI  - Using Embedded Sensors in Independent Living to Predict Gait Changes and Falls.
PG  - 78-94
AB  - This study explored using big data, totaling 66 terabytes over 10 years, captured
      from sensor systems installed in independent living apartments to predict falls
      from pre-fall changes in residents’ Kinect-recorded gait parameters. Over a
      period of 3 to 48 months, we analyzed gait parameters continuously collected for 
      residents who actually fell (n = 13) and those who did not fall (n = 10). We
      analyzed associations between participants’ fall events (n = 69) and pre-fall
      changes in in-home gait speed and stride length (n = 2,070). Preliminary results 
      indicate that a cumulative change in speed over time is associated with the
      probability of a fall (p < .0001). The odds of a resident falling within 3 weeks 
      after a cumulative change of 2.54 cm/s is 4.22 times the odds of a resident
      falling within 3 weeks after no change in in-home gait speed. Results demonstrate
      using sensors to measure in-home gait parameters associated with the occurrence
      of future falls.

TI  - Validating a Commercial Device for Continuous Activity Measurement in the Older
      Adult Population for Dementia Management.
PG  - 51-62
AB  - With the introduction of the large number of fitness devices on the market, there
      are numerous possibilities for their use in managing chronic diseases in older
      adults. For example, monitoring people with dementia using commercially available
      devices that measure heart rate, breathing rate, lung volume, step count, and
      activity level could be used to predict episodic behavioral and psychological
      symptoms before they become distressing or disruptive. However, since these
      devices are designed primarily for fitness assessment, validation of the sensors 
      in a controlled environment with the target cohort population is needed. In this 
      study, we present validation results using a commercial fitness tracker, the
      Hexoskin sensor vest, with thirty-one participants aged 65 and older. Estimated
      physiological measures investigated in this study are heart rate, breathing rate,
      lung volume, step count, and activity level of the participants. Findings
      indicate that while the processed step count, heart rate, and breathing rate show
      strong correlations to the clinically accepted gold standard values, lung volume 
      and activity level do not. This indicates the need to proceed cautiously when
      making clinical decisions using such sensors, and suggests that users should
      focus on the three strongly correlated parameters for further analysis, at least 
      in the older population. The use of physiological measurement devices such as the
      Hexoskin may eventually become a non-intrusive way to continuously assess
      physiological measures in older adults with dementia who are at risk for
      distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms.

TI  - Development of a Wheelchair Skills Home Program for Older Adults Using a
      Participatory Action Design Approach.
LID - 172434
AB  - Restricted mobility is the most common impairment among older adults and a manual
      wheelchair is often prescribed to address these limitations. However, limited
      access to rehabilitation services results in older adults typically receiving
      little or no mobility training when they receive a wheelchair. As an alternative 
      and novel approach, we developed a therapist-monitored wheelchair skills home
      training program delivered via a computer tablet. To optimize efficacy and
      adherence, principles of self-efficacy and adult learning theory were
      foundational in the program design. A participatory action design approach was
      used to engage older adult wheelchair users, care providers, and prescribing
      clinicians in an iterative design and development process. A series of prototypes
      were fabricated and revised, based on feedback from eight stakeholder focus
      groups, until a final version was ready for evaluation in a clinical trial.
      Stakeholder contributions affirmed and enhanced the foundational theoretical
      principles and provided validation of the final product for the target
      population.

TI  - Analysis of Android Device-Based Solutions for Fall Detection.
PG  - 17827-94
AB  - Falls are a major cause of health and psychological problems as well as
      hospitalization costs among older adults. Thus, the investigation on automatic
      Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) has received special attention from the research
      community during the last decade. In this area, the widespread popularity,
      decreasing price, computing capabilities, built-in sensors and multiplicity of
      wireless interfaces of Android-based devices (especially smartphones) have
      fostered the adoption of this technology to deploy wearable and inexpensive
      architectures for fall detection. This paper presents a critical and thorough
      analysis of those existing fall detection systems that are based on Android
      devices. The review systematically classifies and compares the proposals of the
      literature taking into account different criteria such as the system
      architecture, the employed sensors, the detection algorithm or the response in
      case of a fall alarms. The study emphasizes the analysis of the evaluation
      methods that are employed to assess the effectiveness of the detection process.
      The review reveals the complete lack of a reference framework to validate and
      compare the proposals. In addition, the study also shows that most research works
      do not evaluate the actual applicability of the Android devices (with limited
      battery and computing resources) to fall detection solutions.

TI  - Wearable Sensors for Remote Health Monitoring.
LID - 130
AB  - Life expectancy in most countries has been increasing continually over the
      several few decades thanks to significant improvements in medicine, public
      health, as well as personal and environmental hygiene. However, increased life
      expectancy combined with falling birth rates are expected to engender a large
      aging demographic in the near future that would impose significant  burdens on
      the socio-economic structure of these countries. Therefore, it is essential to
      develop cost-effective, easy-to-use systems for the sake of elderly healthcare
      and well-being. Remote health monitoring, based on non-invasive and wearable
      sensors, actuators and modern communication and information technologies offers
      an efficient and cost-effective solution that allows the elderly to continue to
      live in their comfortable home environment instead of expensive healthcare
      facilities. These systems will also allow healthcare personnel to monitor
      important physiological signs of their patients in real time, assess health
      conditions and provide feedback from distant facilities. In this paper, we have
      presented and compared several low-cost and non-invasive health and activity
      monitoring systems that were reported in recent years. A survey on textile-based 
      sensors that can potentially be used in wearable systems is also presented.
      Finally, compatibility of several communication technologies as well as future
      perspectives and research challenges in remote monitoring systems will be
      discussed.

TI  - Sensing Home: A Cost-Effective Design for Smart Home via Heterogeneous Wireless
      Networks.
PG  - 30270-92
AB  - The aging population has inspired the marketing of advanced real time devices for
      home health care, more and more wearable devices and mobile applications, which
      have emerged in this field. However, to properly collect behavior information,
      accurately recognize human activities, and deploy the whole system in a real
      living environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feasible
      wireless-based solution to deploy a data collection scheme, activity recognition 
      model, feedback control and mobile integration via heterogeneous networks. We
      compared and found a suitable algorithm that can be run on cost-efficient
      embedded devices. Specifically, we use the Super Set Transformation method to map
      the raw data into a sparse binary matrix. Furthermore, designed front-end devices
      of low power consumption gather the living data of the habitant via ZigBee to
      reduce the burden of wiring work. Finally, we evaluated our approach and show it 
      can achieve a theoretical time-slice accuracy of 98%. The mapping solution we
      propose is compatible with more wearable devices and mobile apps.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347324
AB  - With the rising age of the population, there is increased need to help elderly
      maintain their independence. Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and
      pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities
      and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and 
      intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing,
      accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of
      the more important aspects of elders’ behaviors that could be assessed with smart
      home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to
      identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell
      time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living
      spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model,
      and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately
      detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of
      0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively.
      These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with
      in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques
      so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.

TI  - One-Class Classification-Based Real-Time Activity Error Detection in Smart Homes.
PG  - 914-23
AB  - Caring for individuals with dementia is frequently associated with extreme
      physical and emotional stress, which often leads to depression. Smart home
      technology and advances in machine learning techniques can provide innovative
      solutions to reduce caregiver burden. One key service that caregivers provide is 
      prompting individuals with memory limitations to initiate and complete daily
      activities. We hypothesize that sensor technologies combined with machine
      learning techniques can automate the process of providing reminder-based
      interventions. The first step towards automated interventions is to detect when
      an individual faces difficulty with activities. We propose machine learning
      approaches based on one-class classification that learn normal activity patterns.
      When we apply these classifiers to activity patterns that were not seen before,
      the classifiers are able to detect activity errors, which represent potential
      prompt situations. We validate our approaches on smart home sensor data obtained 
      from older adult participants, some of whom faced difficulties performing routine
      activities and thus committed errors.

TI  - The Multidisciplinary Approach to Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia. A Narrative
      Review of Non-Pharmacological Treatment.
LID - 1058
AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are chronic diseases with
      progressive deterioration of cognition, function, and behavior leading to severe 
      disability and death. The prevalence of AD and dementia is constantly increasing 
      because of the progressive aging of the population. These conditions represent a 
      considerable challenge to patients, their family and caregivers, and the health
      system, because of the considerable need for resources allocation. There is no
      disease modifying intervention for AD and dementia, and the symptomatic
      pharmacological treatments has limited efficacy and considerable side effects.
      Non-pharmacological treatment (NPT), which includes a wide range of approaches
      and techniques, may play a role in the treatment of AD and dementia.Aim: To
      review, with a narrative approach, current evidence on main NPTs for AD and
      dementia.Methods: PubMed and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews were
      searched for studies written in English and published from 2000 to 2018. The
      bibliography of the main articles was checked to detect other relevant
      papers.Results: The role of NPT has been largely explored in AD and dementia. The
      main NPT types, which were reviewed here, include exercise and motor
      rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation, NPT for behavioral and psychological
      symptoms of dementia, occupational therapy, psychological therapy, complementary 
      and alternative medicine, and new technologies, including information and
      communication technologies, assistive technology and domotics, virtual reality,
      gaming, and telemedicine. We also summarized the role of NPT to address
      caregivers' burden.Conclusions: Although NPT is often applied in the
      multidisciplinary approach to AD and dementia, supporting evidence for their use 
      is still preliminary. Some studies showed statistically significant effect of NPT
      on some outcomes, but their clinical significance is uncertain. Well-designed
      randomized controlled trials with innovative designs are needed to explore the
      efficacy of NPT in AD and dementia. Further studies are required to offer robust 
      neurobiological grounds for the effect of NPT, and to examine its cost-efficacy
      profile in patients with dementia.

TI  - A New Paradigm of Technology Enabled “Vital Signs” for Early Detection of Health 
      Change for Older Adults.
PG  - 281-90
AB  - Environmentally embedded (non-wearable) sensor technology is in continuous use in
      elder housing to monitor a new set of “vital signs” that continuously measure the
      functional status of older adults, detect potential changes in health or
      functional status, and alert healthcare providers for early recognition and
      treatment of those changes. Older adult participants’ respiration, pulse, and
      restlessness are monitored as they sleep. Gait speed, stride length, and stride
      time are calculated daily, and automatically assess for increasing fall risk.
      Activity levels are summarized and graphically displayed for easy interpretation.
      Falls are detected when they occur and alerts are sent immediately to healthcare 
      providers, so time to rescue may be reduced. Automated health alerts are sent to 
      health care staff, based on continuously running algorithms applied to the sensor
      data, days and weeks before typical signs or symptoms are detected by the person,
      family members, or health care providers. Discovering these new functional status
      “vital signs,” developing automated methods for interpreting them, and alerting
      others when changes occur has the potential to transform chronic illness
      management and facilitate aging in place through the end of life. Key findings of
      research in progress at the University of Missouri are discussed in this
      viewpoint article, as well as obstacles to widespread adoption.

TI  - Accessible Home Environments for People with Functional Limitations: A Systematic
      Review.
LID - 826
AB  - The aim of this review is to evaluate the health and social effects of accessible
      home environments for people with functional limitations, in order to provide
      evidence to promote well-informed decision making for policy guideline
      development and choices about public health interventions. MEDLINE and nine other
      electronic databases were searched between December 2014 and January 2015, for
      articles published since 2004. All study types were included in this review. Two 
      reviewers independently screened 12,544 record titles or titles and abstracts
      based on our pre-defined eligibility criteria. We identified 94 articles as
      potentially eligible; and assessed their full text. Included studies were
      critically appraised using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool, version 2011.
      Fourteen studies were included in the review. We did not identify any
      meta-analysis or systematic review directly relevant to the question for this
      systematic review. A narrative approach was used to synthesise the findings of
      the included studies due to methodological and statistical heterogeneity. Results
      suggest that certain interventions to enhance the accessibility of homes can have
      positive health and social effects. Home environments that lack accessibility
      modifications appropriate to the needs of their users are likely to result in
      people with physical impairments becoming disabled at home.

PG  - 339-51
AB  - The data mining and pervasive sensing technologies found in smart homes offer
      unprecedented opportunities for providing health monitoring and assistance to
      individuals experiencing difficulties living independently at home. In order to
      monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design
      technologies that recognize and track activities that people normally perform as 
      part of their daily routines. One question that frequently arises, however, is
      how many smart home sensors are needed and where should they be placed in order
      to accurately recognize activities? We employ data mining techniques to look at
      the problem of sensor selection for activity recognition in smart homes. We
      analyze the results based on six data sets collected in five distinct smart home 
      environments.

TI  - eHealth Literacy and Web 2.0 Health Information Seeking Behaviors Among Baby
      Boomers and Older Adults.
LID - e70
AB  - Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high
      risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are
      increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and
      evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is
      known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for 
      health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent 
      to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use
      influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby 
      boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older
      adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional,
      telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from
      the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device
      use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test
      compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health
      information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to
      determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and
      electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for
      seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0
      users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook
      and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of
      Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those
      who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t217.60=−2.98, P=.003.
      Younger age (b=−0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic
      devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 
      =.17, R2adj =.14, F9,229=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more
      likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1,
      P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health
      information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post
      graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely
      than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information.
      Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with
      greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those
      highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of
      Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more
      diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a
      better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking
      and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making.

TI  - Energy-Efficient Medium Access Control Protocols for Cognitive Radio Sensor
      Networks: A Comparative Survey.
LID - 3781
AB  - The increase of application areas in wireless sensor networks demands novel
      solutions in terms of energy consumption and radio frequency management.
      Cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs) are key for ensuring efficient spectrum
      management, by making it possible to use the unused licensed frequency spectrum
      together with the unlicensed frequency spectrum. Sensor nodes powered by
      energy-constrained batteries necessarily require energy-efficient protocols at
      the routing and medium access control (MAC) layers. In CRSNs, energy efficiency
      is more important because the sensor nodes consume additional energy for spectrum
      sensing and management. To the best of authors’ knowledge, there is no survey on 
      “energy-efficient” MAC protocols for CRSNs in the literature, even though a
      conceptual review on MAC protocols for CRSNs was presented at a conference
      recently. In this paper, energy-efficient MAC protocols for CRSNs are extensively
      surveyed and qualitatively compared. Open issues, and research challenges in the 
      design of MAC protocols for CRSNs, are also discussed.

TI  - Urbanization and health in China, thinking at the national, local and individual 
      levels.
LID - 32
AB  - Background: China has the biggest population in the world, and has been
      experiencing the largest migration in history, and its rapid urbanization has
      profound and lasting impacts on local and national public health. Under these
      conditions, a systems understanding on the correlation among urbanization,
      environmental change and public health and to devise solutions at national, local
      and individual levels are in urgent need. Methods: In this paper, we provide a
      comprehensive review of recent studies which have examined the relationship
      between urbanization, urban environmental changes and human health in China.
      Based on the review, coupled with a systems understanding, we summarize the
      challenges and opportunities for promoting the health and wellbeing of the whole 
      nation at national, local, and individual levels. Results: Urbanization and urban
      expansion result in urban environmental changes, as well as residents’ lifestyle 
      change, which can lead independently and synergistically to human health
      problems. China has undergone an epidemiological transition, shifting from
      infectious to chronic diseases in a much shorter time frame than many other
      countries. Environmental risk factors, particularly air and water pollution, are 
      a major contributing source of morbidity and mortality in China. Furthermore,
      aging population, food support system, and disparity of public service between
      the migrant worker and local residents are important contributions to China’s
      urban health. Conclusions: At the national level, the central government could
      improve current environmental policies, food safety laws, and make adjustments to
      the health care system and to demographic policy. At the local level, local
      government could incorporate healthy life considerations in urban planning
      procedures, make improvements to the local food supply, and enforce environmental
      monitoring and management. At the individual level, urban residents can be
      exposed to education regarding health behaviour choices while being encouraged to
      take responsibility for their health and to participate in environmental
      monitoring and management. Electronic supplementary material: The online version

TI  - Evolution of Cognitive Rehabilitation After Stroke From Traditional Techniques to
      Smart and Personalized Home-Based Information and Communication Technology
      Systems: Literature Review.
LID - e4
AB  - Background: Neurological patients after stroke usually present cognitive deficits
      that cause dependencies in their daily living. These deficits mainly affect the
      performance of some of their daily activities. For that reason, stroke patients
      need long-term processes for their cognitive rehabilitation. Considering that
      classical techniques are focused on acting as guides and are dependent on help
      from therapists, significant efforts are being made to improve current
      methodologies and to use eHealth and Web-based architectures to implement
      information and communication technology (ICT) systems that achieve reliable,
      personalized, and home-based platforms to increase efficiency and level of
      attractiveness for patients and carers. Objective: The goal of this work was to
      provide an overview of the practices implemented for the assessment of stroke
      patients and cognitive rehabilitation. This study puts together traditional
      methods and the most recent personalized platforms based on ICT technologies and 
      Internet of Things. Methods: A literature review has been distributed to a
      multidisciplinary team of researchers from engineering, psychology, and sport
      science fields. The systematic review has been focused on published scientific
      research, other European projects, and the most current innovative large-scale
      initiatives in the area. A total of 3469 results were retrieved from Web of
      Science, 284 studies from Journal of Medical Internet Research, and 15 European
      research projects from Community Research and Development Information Service
      from the last 15 years were reviewed for classification and selection regarding
      their relevance. Results: A total of 7 relevant studies on the screening of
      stroke patients have been presented with 6 additional methods for the analysis of
      kinematics and 9 studies on the execution of goal-oriented activities. Meanwhile,
      the classical methods to provide cognitive rehabilitation have been classified in
      the 5 main techniques implemented. Finally, the review has been finalized with
      the selection of 8 different ICT–based approaches found in scientific-technical
      studies, 9 European projects funded by the European Commission that offer eHealth
      architectures, and other large-scale activities such as smart houses and the
      initiative City4Age. Conclusions: Stroke is one of the main causes that most
      negatively affect countries in the socioeconomic aspect. The design of new
      ICT-based systems should provide 4 main features for an efficient and
      personalized cognitive rehabilitation: support in the execution of complex daily 
      tasks, automatic error detection, home-based performance, and accessibility. Only
      33% of the European projects presented fulfilled those requirements at the same
      time. For this reason, current and future large-scale initiatives focused on
      eHealth and smart environments should try to solve this situation by providing
      more complete and sophisticated platforms.

TI  - Active subjects of passive monitoring: responses to a passive monitoring system
      in low-income independent living.
PG  - 537-60
AB  - Passive monitoring technology is beginning to be reimbursed by third-party payers
      in the United States of America. Given the low voluntary uptake of these
      technologies on the market, it is important to understand the concerns and
      perspectives of users, former users and non-users. In this paper, the range of
      ways older adults relate to passive monitoring in low-income independent-living
      residences is presented. This includes experiences of adoption, non-adoption,
      discontinuation and creative ‘misuse’. The analysis of interviews reveals three
      key insights. First, assumptions built into the technology about how older adults
      live present a problem for many users who experience unwanted disruptions and
      threats to their behavioural autonomy. Second, resident response is varied and
      challenges the dominant image of residents as passive subjects of a passive
      monitoring system. Third, the priorities of older adults (e.g. safety, autonomy, 
      privacy, control, contact) are more diverse and multi-faceted than those of the
      housing organisation staff and family members (e.g. safety, efficiency) who drive
      the passive monitoring intervention. The tension between needs, desires and the
      daily lives of older adults and the technological solutions offered to them is
      made visible by their active responses, including resistance to them. This
      exposes the active and meaningful qualities of older adults’ decisions and
      practices.

TI  - SAMuS: Service-Oriented Architecture for Multisensor Surveillance in Smart Homes.
LID - 150696
AB  - The design of a service-oriented architecture for multisensor surveillance in
      smart homes is presented as an integrated solution enabling automatic deployment,
      dynamic selection, and composition of sensors. Sensors are implemented as
      Web-connected devices, with a uniform Web API. RESTdesc is used to describe the
      sensors and a novel solution is presented to automatically compose Web APIs that 
      can be applied with existing Semantic Web reasoners. We evaluated the solution by
      building a smart Kinect sensor that is able to dynamically switch between IR and 
      RGB and optimizing person detection by incorporating feedback from pressure
      sensors, as such demonstrating the collaboration among sensors to enhance
      detection of complex events. The performance results show that the platform
      scales for many Web APIs as composition time remains limited to a few hundred
      milliseconds in almost all cases.

PG  - 534-44
AB  - Performing daily activities without assistance is important to maintaining an
      independent functional lifestyle. As a result, automated activity prompting
      systems can potentially extend the period of time that adults can age in place.
      In this paper we introduce AP, an algorithm to automate activity prompting based 
      on smart home technology. AP learns prompt rules based on the time when
      activities are typically performed as well as the relationship between activities
      that normally occur in a sequence. We evaluate the AP algorithm based on smart
      home datasets and demonstrate its ability to operate within a physical smart
      environment.

TI  - An Evaluation of Wellness Assessment Visualizations for Older Adults.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Background: Smart home technologies provide a valuable resource to unobtrusively 
      monitor health and wellness within an older adult population. However, the
      breadth and density of data available along with aging associated decreases in
      working memory, prospective memory, spatial cognition, and processing speed can
      make it challenging to comprehend for older adults. We developed visualizations
      of smart home health data integrated into a framework of wellness. We evaluated
      the visualizations through focus groups with older adults and identified
      recommendations to guide the future development of visualizations. Materials and 
      Methods: We conducted four focus groups with older adult participants (n=31) at
      an independent retirement community. Participants were presented with three
      different visualizations from a wellness pilot study. A qualitative descriptive
      analysis was conducted to identify thematic content. Results: We identified three
      themes related to processing and application of visualizations: (1) values of
      visualizations for wellness assessment, (2) cognitive processing approaches to
      visualizations, and (3) integration of health data for visualization. In
      addition, the focus groups highlighted key design considerations of
      visualizations important towards supporting decision-making and evaluation
      assessments within integrated health displays. Conclusions: Participants found
      inherent value in having visualizations available to proactively engage with
      their healthcare provider. Integrating the visualizations into a wellness
      framework helped reduce the complexity of raw smart home data. There has been
      limited work on health visualizations from a consumer perspective, in particular 
      for an older adult population. Creating appropriately designed visualizations is 
      valuable towards promoting consumer involvement within the shared decision-making
      process of care.

TI  - Pervasive Computing Technologies to Continuously Assess Alzheimer’s Disease
      Progression and Intervention Efficacy.
LID - 102
AB  - Traditionally, assessment of functional and cognitive status of individuals with 
      dementia occurs in brief clinic visits during which time clinicians extract a
      snapshot of recent changes in individuals’ health. Conventionally, this is done
      using various clinical assessment tools applied at the point of care and relies
      on patients’ and caregivers’ ability to accurately recall daily activity and
      trends in personal health. These practices suffer from the infrequency and
      generally short durations of visits. Since 2004, researchers at the Oregon Center
      for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) at the Oregon Health and Science University
      have been working on developing technologies to transform this model. ORCATECH
      researchers have developed a system of continuous in-home monitoring using
      pervasive computing technologies that make it possible to more accurately track
      activities and behaviors and measure relevant intra-individual changes. We have
      installed a system of strategically placed sensors in over 480 homes and have
      been collecting data for up to 8 years. Using this continuous in-home monitoring 
      system, ORCATECH researchers have collected data on multiple behaviors such as
      gait and mobility, sleep and activity patterns, medication adherence, and
      computer use. Patterns of intra-individual variation detected in each of these
      areas are used to predict outcomes such as low mood, loneliness, and cognitive
      function. These methods have the potential to improve the quality of patient
      health data and in turn patient care especially related to cognitive decline.
      Furthermore, the continuous real-world nature of the data may improve the
      efficiency and ecological validity of clinical intervention studies.

TI  - Personalized Telehealth in the Future: A Global Research Agenda.
LID - e53
AB  - As telehealth plays an even greater role in global health care delivery, it will 
      be increasingly important to develop a strong evidence base of successful,
      innovative telehealth solutions that can lead to scalable and sustainable
      telehealth programs. This paper has two aims: (1) to describe the challenges of
      promoting telehealth implementation to advance adoption and (2) to present a
      global research agenda for personalized telehealth within chronic disease
      management. Using evidence from the United States and the European Union, this
      paper provides a global overview of the current state of telehealth services and 
      benefits, presents fundamental principles that must be addressed to advance the
      status quo, and provides a framework for current and future research initiatives 
      within telehealth for personalized care, treatment, and prevention. A broad,
      multinational research agenda can provide a uniform framework for identifying and
      rapidly replicating best practices, while concurrently fostering global
      collaboration in the development and rigorous testing of new and emerging
      telehealth technologies. In this paper, the members of the Transatlantic
      Telehealth Research Network offer a 12-point research agenda for future
      telehealth applications within chronic disease management.

TI  - Passive Sensor Technology Interface to Assess Elder Activity in Independent
      Living.
PG  - 318-25
AB  - Background: Effectiveness of clinical information systems to improve nursing and 
      patient outcomes depends on human factors including system usability,
      organizational workflow, and user satisfaction. Objective: To examine to what
      extent residents, family members, and clinicians find a sensor data interface
      used to monitor elder activity levels usable and useful in an independent living 
      setting. Methods: Three independent expert reviewers conducted an initial
      heuristic evaluation. Subsequently, 20 end users (5 residents, 5 family members, 
      5 registered nurses, and 5 physicians) participated in the evaluation. During the
      evaluation each participant was asked to complete three scenarios taken from
      three residents. Morae recorder software was used to capture data during the user
      interactions. Results: The heuristic evaluation resulted in 26 recommendations
      for interface improvement; these were classified under the headings content,
      aesthetic appeal, navigation, and architecture, which were derived from heuristic
      results. Total time for elderly residents to complete scenarios was much greater 
      than for other users. Family members spent more time than clinicians, but less
      time than residents to complete scenarios. Elder residents and family members had
      difficulty interpreting clinical data and graphs, experienced information
      overload, and did not understand terminology. All users found the sensor data
      interface useful for identifying changing resident activities. Discussion: Older 
      adult users have special needs that should be addressed when designing clinical
      interfaces for them, especially information as important as health information.
      Evaluating human factors during user interactions with clinical information
      systems should be a requirement before implementation.

TI  - Geriatric Telemedicine: Background and Evidence for Telemedicine as a Way to
      Address the Challenges of Geriatrics.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - Objectives: The global population of elderly people is increasing at a remarkable
      rate, which may be expected to continue for some time. Older patients require
      more care, and with the current model of care delivery, the costs may be expected
      to rise, although higher cost is unsustainable. For this reason, a new pattern of
      practice is needed. Telemedicine will be presented as a highly effective and
      necessary tool in geriatrics. Methods: This review will present some of the
      background and evidence for telemedicine as a way to address the challenges of
      geriatrics through geriatric telemedicine. Some of the evidence for the value of 
      telemedicine as a tool for physicians and healthcare systems is presented.
      Results: Telemedicine offers many means to address the problems of geriatric care
      in creative ways. The use of electronic medicine, telecommunications, and
      information management has now found its way into the very fabric of health care.
      The use of telemedicine is a fait accompli in much of the world, and it continues
      to have an increasing role deeply imbedded in our electronic practices coupled
      with social media. Conclusions: The evidence for successful incorporation of
      telemedicine into practice is abundant and continues to accrue. This is a great
      opportunity for medical practice to evolve to new levels of engagement with
      patients and new levels of attainment in terms of quality care.

TI  - Process Mining for Individualized Behavior Modeling Using Wireless Tracking in
      Nursing Homes.
PG  - 15434-51
AB  - The analysis of human behavior patterns is increasingly used for several research
      fields. The individualized modeling of behavior using classical techniques
      requires too much time and resources to be effective. A possible solution would
      be the use of pattern recognition techniques to automatically infer models to
      allow experts to understand individual behavior. However, traditional pattern
      recognition algorithms infer models that are not readily understood by human
      experts. This limits the capacity to benefit from the inferred models. Process
      mining technologies can infer models as workflows, specifically designed to be
      understood by experts, enabling them to detect specific behavior patterns in
      users. In this paper, the eMotiva process mining algorithms are presented. These 
      algorithms filter, infer and visualize workflows. The workflows are inferred from
      the samples produced by an indoor location system that stores the location of a
      resident in a nursing home. The visualization tool is able to compare and
      highlight behavior patterns in order to facilitate expert understanding of human 
      behavior. This tool was tested with nine real users that were monitored for a
      25-week period. The results achieved suggest that the behavior of users is
      continuously evolving and changing and that this change can be measured, allowing
      for behavioral change detection.

TI  - Patterns of Technology Use Among Older Adults With and Without Disabilities.
PG  - 412-21
AB  - Purpose of the Study:: The purpose of this study was to describe prevalence of
      technology use among adults ages 65 and older, particularly for those with
      disability and activity-limiting symptoms and impairments. Design and Methods::
      Data from the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally
      representative sample of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries (N = 7,609),
      were analyzed. Analysis consisted of technology use (use of e-mail/text messages 
      and the internet) by sociodemographic and health characteristics and prevalence
      ratios for technology usage by disability status. Results:: Forty percent of
      older adults used e-mail or text messaging and 42.7% used the internet. Higher
      prevalence of technology use was associated with younger age, male sex, white
      race, higher education level, and being married (all p values <.001). After
      adjustment for sociodemographic and health characteristics, technology use
      decreased significantly with greater limitations in physical capacity and greater
      disability. Vision impairment and memory limitations were also associated with
      lower likelihood of technology use. Implications:: Technology usage in U.S. older
      adults varied significantly by sociodemographic and health status. Prevalence of 
      technology use differed by the type of disability and activity-limiting
      impairments. The internet, e-mail, and text messaging might be viable mediums for
      health promotion and communication, particularly for younger cohorts of older
      adults and those with certain types of impairment and less severe disability.

TI  - CRAFFT: An Activity Prediction Model based on Bayesian Networks.
PG  - 193-205
AB  - Recent advances in the areas of pervasive computing, data mining, and machine
      learning offer unique opportunities to provide health monitoring and assistance
      for individuals facing difficulties to live independently in their homes. Several
      components have to work together to provide health monitoring for smart home
      residents including, but not limited to, activity recognition, activity
      discovery, activity prediction, and prompting system. Compared to the significant
      research done to discover and recognize activities, less attention has been given
      to predict the future activities that the resident is likely to perform. Activity
      prediction components can play a major role in design of a smart home. For
      instance, by taking advantage of an activity prediction module, a smart home can 
      learn context-aware rules to prompt individuals to initiate important activities.
      In this paper, we propose an activity prediction model using Bayesian networks
      together with a novel two-step inference process to predict both the next
      activity features and the next activity label. We also propose an approach to
      predict the start time of the next activity which is based on modeling the
      relative start time of the predicted activity using the continuous normal
      distribution and outlier detection. To validate our proposed models, we used real
      data collected from physical smart environments.

TI  - Connectivity for Healthcare and Well-Being Management: Examples from Six European
      Projects.
PG  - 1947-71
AB  - Technological advances and societal changes in recent years have contributed to a
      shift in traditional care models and in the relationship between patients and
      their doctors/carers, with (in general) an increase in the patient-carer physical
      distance and corresponding changes in the modes of access to relevant care
      information by all groups. The objective of this paper is to showcase the
      research efforts of six projects (that the authors are currently, or have
      recently been, involved in), CAALYX, eCAALYX, COGKNOW, EasyLine+, I2HOME, and
      SHARE-it, all funded by the European Commission towards a future where citizens
      can take an active role into managing their own healthcare. Most importantly,
      sensitive groups of citizens, such as the elderly, chronically ill and those
      suffering from various physical and cognitive disabilities, will be able to
      maintain vital and feature-rich connections with their families, friends and
      healthcare providers, who can then respond to, and prevent, the development of
      adverse health conditions in those they care for in a timely manner, wherever the
      carers and the people cared for happen to be.

TI  - Modeling Accessibility of Screening and Treatment Facilities for Older Adults
      using Transportation Networks.
PG  - 64-75
AB  - Increased lifespans and population growth have resulted in an older U.S. society 
      that must reckon with the complex oral health needs that arise as adults age.
      Understanding accessibility to screening and treatment facilities for older
      adults is necessary in order to provide them with preventive and restorative
      services. This study uses an agent-based model to examine the accessibility of
      screening and treatment facilities via transportation networks for older adults
      living in the neighborhoods of northern Manhattan, New York City. Older adults
      are simulated as socioeconomically distinct agents who move along a GIS-based
      transportation network using transportation modes that mediate their access to
      screening and treatment facilities. This simulation model includes four types of 
      mobile agents as a simplifying assumption: walk, by car, by bus, or by van (i.e.,
      a form of transportation assistance for older adults). These mobile agents follow
      particular routes: older adults who travel by car, bus, and van follow street
      roads, whereas pedestrians follow walkways. The model enables the user to focus
      on one neighborhood at a time for analysis. The spatial dimension of an older
      adult’s accessibility to screening and treatment facilities is simulated through 
      the travel costs (indicated by travel time or distance) incurred in the GIS-based
      model environment, where lower travel costs to screening and treatment facilities
      imply better access. This model provides a framework for representing
      health-seeking behavior that is contextualized by a transportation network in a
      GIS environment.

TI  - A Depth Video Sensor-Based Life-Logging Human Activity Recognition System for
      Elderly Care in Smart Indoor Environments.
PG  - 11735-59
AB  - Recent advancements in depth video sensors technologies have made human activity 
      recognition (HAR) realizable for elderly monitoring applications. Although
      conventional HAR utilizes RGB video sensors, HAR could be greatly improved with
      depth video sensors which produce depth or distance information. In this paper, a
      depth-based life logging HAR system is designed to recognize the daily activities
      of elderly people and turn these environments into an intelligent living space.
      Initially, a depth imaging sensor is used to capture depth silhouettes. Based on 
      these silhouettes, human skeletons with joint information are produced which are 
      further used for activity recognition and generating their life logs. The
      life-logging system is divided into two processes. Firstly, the training system
      includes data collection using a depth camera, feature extraction and training
      for each activity via Hidden Markov Models. Secondly, after training, the
      recognition engine starts to recognize the learned activities and produces life
      logs. The system was evaluated using life logging features against principal
      component and independent component features and achieved satisfactory
      recognition rates against the conventional approaches. Experiments conducted on
      the smart indoor activity datasets and the MSRDailyActivity3D dataset show
      promising results. The proposed system is directly applicable to any elderly
      monitoring system, such as monitoring healthcare problems for elderly people, or 
      examining the indoor activities of people at home, office or hospital.

TI  - On the Disambiguation of Passively Measured In-home Gait Velocities from
      Multi-person Smart Homes.
PG  - 165-74
AB  - In-home monitoring of gait velocity with passive PIR sensors in a smart home has 
      been shown to be an effective method of continuously and unobtrusively measuring 
      this important predictor of cognitive function and mobility. However, passive
      measurements of velocity are nonspecific with regard to who generated each
      measurement or walking event. As a result, this method is not suitable for
      multi-person homes without additional information to aid in the disambiguation of
      gait velocities. In this paper we propose a method based on Gaussian mixture
      models (GMMs) combined with infrequent clinical assessments of gait velocity to
      model in-home walking speeds of two or more residents. Modeling the gait
      parameters directly allows us to avoid the more difficult problem of assigning
      each measured velocity individually to the correct resident. We show that if the 
      clinically measured gait velocities of residents are separated by at least 15
      cm/s a GMM can be accurately fit to the in-home gait velocity data. We
      demonstrate the accuracy of this method by showing that the correlation between
      the means of the GMMs and the clinically measured gait velocities is 0.877 (p
      value < 0.0001) with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of (0.79, 0.94) for 54
      measurements of 20 subjects living in multi-person homes. Example applications of
      using this method to track in-home mean velocities over time are also given.

TI  - Using the Technology Acceptance Model to explore community dwelling older adults’
      perceptions of a 3D interior design application to facilitate pre-discharge home 
      adaptations.
LID - 73
AB  - Background: In the UK occupational therapy pre-discharge home visits are
      routinely carried out as a means of facilitating safe transfer from the hospital 
      to home. Whilst they are an integral part of practice, there is little evidence
      to demonstrate they have a positive outcome on the discharge process. Current
      issues for patients are around the speed of home visits and the lack of shared
      decision making in the process, resulting in less than 50 % of the specialist
      equipment installed actually being used by patients on follow-up. To improve
      practice there is an urgent need to examine other ways of conducting home visits 
      to facilitate safe discharge. We believe that Computerised 3D Interior Design
      Applications (CIDAs) could be a means to support more efficient, effective and
      collaborative practice. A previous study explored practitioners perceptions of
      using CIDAs; however it is important to ascertain older adult’s views about the
      usability of technology and to compare findings. This study explores the
      perceptions of community dwelling older adults with regards to adopting and using
      CIDAs as an assistive tool for the home adaptations process. Methods: Ten
      community dwelling older adults participated in individual interactive
      task-focused usability sessions with a customised CIDA, utilising the think-aloud
      protocol and individual semi-structured interviews. Template analysis was used to
      carry out both deductive and inductive analysis of the think-aloud and interview 
      data. Initially, a deductive stance was adopted, using the three pre-determined
      high-level themes of the technology acceptance model (TAM): Perceived Usefulness 
      (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Actual Use (AU). Inductive template analysis 
      was then carried out on the data within these themes, from which a number of
      sub-thmes emerged. Results: Regarding PU, participants believed CIDAs served as a
      useful visual tool and saw clear potential to facilitate shared understanding and
      partnership in care delivery. For PEOU, participants were able to create 3D home 
      environments however a number of usability issues must still be addressed. The AU
      theme revealed the most likely usage scenario would be collaborative involving
      both patient and practitioner, as many participants did not feel confident or see
      sufficient value in using the application autonomously. Conclusions: This
      research found that older adults perceived that CIDAs were likely to serve as a
      valuable tool which facilitates and enhances levels of patient/practitioner
      collaboration and empowerment. Older adults also suggested a redesign of the
      interface so that less sophisticated dexterity and motor functions are required. 
      However, older adults were not confident, or did not see sufficient value in
      using the application autonomously. Future research is needed to further
      customise the CIDA software, in line with the outcomes of this study, and to
      explore the potential of collaborative application patient/practitioner-based
      deployment.

TI  - Activity Recognition on Streaming Sensor Data.
PG  - 138-54
AB  - Many real-world applications that focus on addressing needs of a human, require
      information about the activities being performed by the human in real-time. While
      advances in pervasive computing have lead to the development of wireless and
      non-intrusive sensors that can capture the necessary activity information,
      current activity recognition approaches have so far experimented on either a
      scripted or pre-segmented sequence of sensor events related to activities. In
      this paper we propose and evaluate a sliding window based approach to perform
      activity recognition in an on line or streaming fashion; recognizing activities
      as and when new sensor events are recorded. To account for the fact that
      different activities can be best characterized by different window lengths of
      sensor events, we incorporate the time decay and mutual information based
      weighting of sensor events within a window. Additional contextual information in 
      the form of the previous activity and the activity of the previous window is also
      appended to the feature describing a sensor window. The experiments conducted to 
      evaluate these techniques on real-world smart home datasets suggests that
      combining mutual information based weighting of sensor events and adding past
      contextual information into the feature leads to best performance for streaming
      activity recognition.

TI  - Barriers to Independent Living for Individuals with Disabilities and Seniors.
PG  - 70-7
AB  - Individuals with disabilities and seniors often lack the freedom to choose with
      whom they live and where they reside. Service options may involve moving
      consumers to large nursing facilities or other less-preferred settings rather
      than optimizing environmental supports in their own home or in less restrictive
      settings. Not only do adults usually enjoy greater choice when they live in their
      own homes relative to individuals living in congregate care or group home
      settings but independent and semi-independent settings are also associated with
      better outcomes and lower costs. Identifying variables that serve as barriers to 
      independent living is especially important given estimates predicting that the
      numbers of seniors and individuals with disabilities will double in the next
      20 years. This doubling will tax an already burdened and costly system of care.
      The present study queried consumers and other key stakeholders about potential
      barriers to independent living and their importance. Findings not only revealed a
      high degree of overlap between identified barriers and their importance ratings
      within groups but also showed clear differences in potential barriers across the 
      groups assessed (individuals with disabilities and senior citizens).

TI  - A Smart-Home System to Unobtrusively and Continuously Assess Loneliness in Older 
      Adults.
LID - 2800311
AB  - Loneliness is a common condition in older adults and is associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality, decreased sleep quality, and increased risk of cognitive
      decline. Assessing loneliness in older adults is challenging due to the negative 
      desirability biases associated with being lonely. Thus, it is necessary to
      develop more objective techniques to assess loneliness in older adults. In this
      paper, we describe a system to measure loneliness by assessing in-home behavior
      using wireless motion and contact sensors, phone monitors, and computer software 
      as well as algorithms developed to assess key behaviors of interest. We then
      present results showing the accuracy of the system in detecting loneliness in a
      longitudinal study of 16 older adults who agreed to have the sensor platform
      installed in their own homes for up to 8 months. We show that loneliness is
      significantly associated with both time out-of-home

TI  - Integrating an openEHR-based personalized virtual model for the ageing population
      within HBase.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in ageing population that
      carries an increased risk for adverse health outcomes including falls,
      hospitalization, disability, and mortality. As these outcomes affect the health
      and social care planning, during the last years there is a tendency of investing 
      in monitoring and preventing strategies. Although a number of electronic health
      record (EHR) systems have been developed, including personalized virtual patient 
      models, there are limited ageing population oriented systems. Methods: We exploit
      the openEHR framework for the representation of frailty in ageing population in
      order to attain semantic interoperability, and we present the methodology for
      adoption or development of archetypes. We also propose a framework for a
      one-to-one mapping between openEHR archetypes and a column-family NoSQL database 
      (HBase) aiming at the integration of existing and newly developed archetypes into
      it. Results: The requirement analysis of our study resulted in the definition of 
      22 coherent and clinically meaningful parameters for the description of frailty
      in older adults. The implemented openEHR methodology led to the direct use of 22 
      archetypes, the modification and reuse of two archetypes, and the development of 
      28 new archetypes. Additionally, the mapping procedure led to two different HBase
      tables for the storage of the data. Conclusions: In this work, an openEHR-based
      virtual patient model has been designed and integrated into an HBase storage
      system, exploiting the advantages of the underlying technologies. This framework 
      can serve as a base for the development of a decision support system using the
      openEHR’s Guideline Definition Language in the future.

      issues: corroboration of the Preservation of Self model and reactions to a “smart
      dresser” computer-based dressing aid.
LID - 2055207616677129
AB  - Objective: To gain an understanding of Latino/Hispanic caregivers’
      dementia-related dressing issues, their impressions of using a “smart”
      context-aware dresser to coach dressing, and recommendations to improve its
      acceptability. Method: The same Latina moderator conducted all the caregiver
      focus groups. She followed a semi-structured interview guide that was previously 
      used with White and African American family caregivers who experienced
      Alzheimer’s disease related dressing challenges. From that study, the
      Preservation of Self model emerged. Using a deductive qualitative analytic
      approach, we applied the thematic domains from the Preservation of Self model to 
      ascertain relevance to Latino/Hispanic caregivers. Results: Twenty
      Latino/Hispanic experienced caregivers were recruited, enrolled, and participated
      in one of three focus groups. The majority were female (75%) and either the
      spouse (25%) or adult child (35%). Striking similarities occurred with the
      dressing challenges and alignment with the Preservation of Self model. Ethnic
      differences arose in concerns over assimilation weakening the Latino culture of
      family caregiving. Regional clothing preferences were noted. Technology
      improvement recommendations for our system, called DRESS, included developing
      bilingual prompting dialogs and video modules using the local vernacular to
      improve cultural sensitivity. Caregivers identified the potential for the
      technology to enable user privacy, empowerment, and exercise as well as offering 
      respite time for themselves. Conclusion: Findings suggest dementia-related
      dressing issues were shared in common by different racial/ethnic groups but the
      response to them was influenced by cultural dynamics. For the first time
      Latino/Hispanic voices are heard to reflect their positive technology
      impressions, concerns, and recommendations in order to begin to address the
      cultural digital disparities divide.

      ‘co-produced’ – day-to-day by the efforts of older people, and their formal and
      informal networks of carers (e.g. family, friends, neighbours). First, we reveal 
      how ‘bricolage’ allows care recipients and family members to customise assisted
      living technologies to individual needs. We argue that making customisation
      easier through better design must be part of making assisted living technologies 
      ‘work’. Second, we draw attention to the importance of formal and informal carers
      establishing and maintaining mutual awareness of the older person’s circumstances
      day-to-day so they can act in a concerted and coordinated way when problems
      arise. Unfortunately, neither the design of most current assisted living
      technologies, nor the ways care services are typically configured, acknowledges
      these realities of ageing in place. We conclude that rather than more ‘advanced’ 
      technologies, the success of ageing in place programmes will depend on effortful 
      alignments in the technical, organisational and social configuration of support.

TI  - Integrated data visualisation: an approach to capture older adults’ wellness.
PG  - 89-104
AB  - Informatics tools can help support the health and independence of older adults.
      In this paper, we present an approach towards integrating health-monitoring data 
      and describe several techniques for the assessment and visualisation of
      integrated health and well-being of older adults. We present three different
      visualisation techniques to provide distinct alternatives towards display of the 
      same information, focusing on reducing the cognitive load of data interpretation.
      We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating health-monitoring information into 
      a comprehensive measure of wellness, while also highlighting the challenges of
      designing visual displays targeted at multiple user groups. These visual displays
      of wellness can be incorporated into personal health records and can be an
      effective support for informed decision-making.

TI  - Willingness of older adults to share data and privacy concerns after exposure to 
      unobtrusive in-home monitoring.
PG  - 428-35
AB  - Older adult participants in the Intelligent Systems for Assessment of Aging
      Changes study (ISAAC) carried out by the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology
      (ORCATECH) were surveyed regarding their attitudes about unobtrusive home
      monitoring and computer use at baseline and after one year (n=119). The survey
      was part of a longitudinal study using in-home sensor technology to detect
      cognitive changes and other health problems. Our primary objective was to measure
      willingness to share health or activity data with one’s doctor or family members 
      and concerns about privacy or security of monitoring over one year of study
      participation. Differences in attitudes of participants with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI) compared to those with normal cognition were also examined. A
      high proportion (over 72%) of participants reported acceptance of in-home and
      computer monitoring and willingness to have data shared with their doctor or
      family members. However, a majority (60%) reported concerns related to privacy or
      security; these concerns increased after one year of participation. Few
      differences between participants with MCI and those with normal cognition were
      identified. Findings suggest that involvement in this unobtrusive in-home
      monitoring study may have raised awareness about the potential privacy risks of
      technology. Still, results show high acceptance, stable over time, of sharing
      information from monitoring systems with family members and doctors. Our findings
      have important implications for the deployment of technologies among older adults
      in research studies as well as in the general community.

TI  - Health and Fitness Apps for Hands-Free Voice-Activated Assistants: Content
      Analysis.
LID - e174
AB  - Background: Hands-free voice-activated assistants and their associated devices
      have recently gained popularity with the release of commercial products,
      including Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Voice-activated assistants have many
      potential use cases in healthcare including education, health tracking and
      monitoring, and assistance with locating health providers. However, little is
      known about the types of health and fitness apps available for voice-activated
      assistants as it is an emerging market. Objective: This review aimed to examine
      the characteristics of health and fitness apps for commercially available,
      hands-free voice-activated assistants, including Amazon Alexa and Google
      Assistant. Methods: Amazon Alexa Skills Store and Google Assistant app were
      searched to find voice-activated assistant apps designated by vendors as health
      and fitness apps. Information was extracted for each app including name,
      description, vendor, vendor rating, user reviews and ratings, cost, developer and
      security policies, and the ability to pair with a smartphone app and website and 
      device. Using a codebook, two reviewers independently coded each app using the
      vendor’s descriptions and the app name into one or more health and fitness,
      intended age group, and target audience categories. A third reviewer adjudicated 
      coding disagreements until consensus was reached. Descriptive statistics were
      used to summarize app characteristics. Results: Overall, 309 apps were reviewed; 
      health education apps (87) were the most commonly occurring, followed by fitness 
      and training (72), nutrition (33), brain training and games (31), and health
      monitoring (25). Diet and calorie tracking apps were infrequent. Apps were mostly
      targeted towards adults and general audiences with few specifically geared
      towards patients, caregivers, or medical professionals. Most apps were free to
      enable or use and 18.1% (56/309) could be paired with a smartphone app and
      website and device; 30.7% (95/309) of vendors provided privacy policies; and
      22.3% (69/309) provided terms of use. The majority (36/42, 85.7%) of Amazon Alexa
      apps were rated by the vendor as mature or guidance suggested, which were geared 
      towards adults only. When there was a user rating available, apps had a wide
      range of ratings from 1 to 5 stars with a mean of 2.97. Google Assistant apps did
      not have user reviews available, whereas most of Amazon Alexa apps had at least
      1-9 reviews available. Conclusions: The emerging market of health and fitness
      apps for voice-activated assistants is still nascent and mainly focused on health
      education and fitness. Voice-activated assistant apps had a wide range of content
      areas but many published in the health and fitness categories did not actually
      have a clear health or fitness focus. This may, in part, be due to Amazon and
      Google policies, which place restrictions on the delivery of care or direct
      recording of health data. As in the mobile app market, the content and
      functionalities may evolve to meet growing demands for self-monitoring and
      disease management.

TI  - Review of Three-Dimensional Human-Computer Interaction with Focus on the Leap
      Motion Controller.
LID - 2194
AB  - Modern hardware and software development has led to an evolution of user
      interfaces from command-line to natural user interfaces for virtual immersive
      environments. Gestures imitating real-world interaction tasks increasingly
      replace classical two-dimensional interfaces based on
      Windows/Icons/Menus/Pointers (WIMP) or touch metaphors. Thus, the purpose of this
      paper is to survey the state-of-the-art Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
      techniques with a focus on the special field of three-dimensional interaction.
      This includes an overview of currently available interaction devices, their
      applications of usage and underlying methods for gesture design and recognition. 
      Focus is on interfaces based on the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) and
      corresponding methods of gesture design and recognition. Further, a review of
      evaluation methods for the proposed natural user interfaces is given.

      interventions for carers of home dwelling older people.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - BACKGROUND:: A growing number of studies of informal carers of older people
      reveal positive results concerning support via Information and Communication
      Technologies (ICT). Systematic examination of factors that have a potential
      impact on carer outcomes are needed to inform future research. OBJECTIVE:: To
      explore studies concerning ICT support of adult carers of older people and to
      identify study characteristics that have a potential impact on carer outcomes.
      METHODS:: This integrative review includes 123 studies published since 2005.
      Fundamental questions for designing sensitive support interventions; ‘who, what, 
      and how’ were applied to a synthesis of the results. RESULTS:: Identified
      characteristics from the studies responding to the who question included
      variables of the carers, such as their relationship with the care recipient or
      their ethnicity. Characteristics related to the what question related to the
      types of interventions, and the how question concerned the different services or 
      programs offered, the idiosyncratic needs of the carers, and the types of
      technologies used. CONCLUSION:: Results are discussed according to micro, meso
      and macro levels of analysis. This extensive review can inform future studies and
      highlight the evidence in the area for decision makers, practitioners and/or NGOs
      working with innovative forms of support for carers of older people.

TI  - Evolution of an Early Illness Warning System to Monitor Frail Elders in
      Independent Living.
PG  - 337-63
AB  - This paper describes the evolution of an early illness warning system used by an 
      interdisciplinary team composed of clinicians and engineers in an independent
      living facility. The early illness warning system consists of algorithms which
      analyze resident activity patterns obtained from sensors embedded in residents’
      apartments. The engineers designed an automated reasoning system to generate
      clinically relevant alerts which are sent to clinicians when significant changes 
      occur in the sensor data, for example declining activity levels. During January
      2010 through July 2010, clinicians and engineers conducted weekly iterative
      review cycles of the early illness warning system to discuss concerns about the
      functionality of the warning system, to recommend solutions for the concerns, and
      to evaluate the implementation of the solutions. A total of 45 concerns were
      reviewed during this period. Iterative reviews resulted in greater efficiencies
      and satisfaction for clinician users who were monitoring elder activity patterns.

TI  - Questionnaire development and validation for designing a health telemonitoring
      system for frail elderly people.
LID - 2055207619838940
AB  - Background: Advancements in information technology have been instrumental in
      successful recent developments in telemonitoring systems. In this regard, there
      is a lack of development of valid and reliable tools to determine the
      requirements and applications of telemonitoring systems used to provide health
      care for frail elderly people living at home, specifically in a national setting.
      Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2018. The statistical
      population was 15 geriatric and gerontology professionals and 15 health
      information management experts. Then, content validity ratio (CVR), Cronbach's
      alpha, and correlation coefficient were calculated for measuring content
      validity, internal consistency and external reliability (through the test–retest 
      method) respectively. SPSS software was used to analyze the collected data.
      Results: Based on the identified items, a draft questionnaire was developed.
      Using the validity analysis in two stages, 37 items were removed, and 60 items
      were approved as the essential system requirements. The final questionnaire was
      organized into five sections with content validity index 99% and internal
      reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.9). Furthermore, the external
      reliability results of the questionnaire showed that this instrument has a
      desirable correlation coefficient (r = 0.85, p-value<0.05). Conclusion:
      Considering the desirable validity and reliability of the questionnaire
      developed, it is recommended to telemonitoring system designers to determine the 
      usages and requirements of health monitoring systems for frail elderly people
      living at home. The verified instrument is suitable for use in countries with the
      same living conditions and level of development as Iran.

AB  - Background: With the rise in popularity of Web 2.0 technologies, the sharing of
      patient experiences about physicians on online forums and medical websites has
      become a common practice. However, negative comments posted by patients are
      considered to be more influential by other patients and physicians than those
      that are satisfactory. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze negative
      comments posted online about physicians and to identify possible solutions to
      improve patient satisfaction, as well as their relationship with physicians.
      Methods: A Java-based program was developed to collect patient comments on the
      Good Doctor website, one of the most popular online health communities in China. 
      A total of 3012 negative comments concerning 1029 physicians (mean 2.93 [SD
      4.14]) from 5 highly ranked hospitals in Beijing were extracted for content
      analysis. An initial coding framework was constructed with 2 research assistants 
      involved in the codification. Results: Analysis, based on the collected 3012
      negative comments, revealed that unhappy patients are not alike and that their
      complaints cover a wide range of issues experienced throughout the whole process 
      of medical consultation. Among them, physicians in Obstetrics and Gynecology
      (606/3012, 20.12%; P=.001) and Internal Medicine (487/3012, 16.17%; P=.80)
      received the most negative comments. For negative comments per physician,
      Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (mean 5.72, P<.001) and Andrology
      (mean 5, P=.02) ranked the highest. Complaints relating to insufficient medical
      consultation duration (577/3012, 19.16%), physician impatience (527/3012,
      17.50%), and perceived poor therapeutic effect (370/3012, 12.28%) received the
      highest number of negative comments. Specific groups of people, such as those
      accompanying older patients or children, traveling patients, or very important
      person registrants, were shown to demonstrate little tolerance for poor medical
      service. Conclusions: Analysis of online patient complaints provides an
      innovative approach to understand factors associated with patient
      dissatisfaction. The outcomes of this study could be of benefit to hospitals or
      physicians seeking to improve their delivery of patient-centered services.
      Patients are expected to be more understanding of overloaded physicians’
      workloads, which are impacted by China’s stretched medical resources, as efforts 
      are made to build more harmonious physician-patient relationships.

TI  - Novel pervasive scenarios for home management: the Butlers architecture.
LID - 52
AB  - Many efforts today aim to energy saving, promoting the user’s awareness and
      virtuous behavior in a sustainability perspective. Our houses, appliances, energy
      meters and devices are becoming smarter and connected, domotics is increasing
      possibilities in house automation and control, and ambient intelligence and
      assisted living are bringing attention onto people’s needs from different
      viewpoints.Our assumption is that considering these aspects together allows for
      novel intriguing possibilities. To this end, in this paper we combine home energy
      management with domotics, coordination technologies, intelligent agents, ambient 
      intelligence, ubiquitous technologies and gamification to devise novel scenarios,
      where energy monitoring and management is just the basic brick of a much wider
      and comprehensive home management system. The aim is to control home appliances
      well beyond energy consumption, combining home comfort, appliance scheduling,
      safety constraints, etc. with dynamically-changeable users’ preferences, goals
      and priorities. At the same time, usability and attractiveness are seen as key
      success factors: so, the intriguing technologies available in most houses and
      smart devices are exploited to make the system configuration and use simpler,
      entertaining and attractive for users. These aspects are also integrated with
      ubiquitous and pervasive technologies, geo-localization, social networks and
      communities to provide enhanced functionalities and support smarter application
      scenarios, hereby further strengthening technology acceptation and
      diffusion.Accordingly, we first analyse the system requirements and define a
      reference multi-layer architectural model – the Butlers architecture – that
      specifies seven layers of functionalities, correlating the requirements, the
      corresponding technologies and the consequent value-added for users in each
      layer. Then, we outline a set of notable scenarios of increasing functionalities 
      and complexity, discuss the structure of the corresponding system patterns in
      terms of the proposed architecture, and make this concrete by presenting some
      comprehensive interaction examples as comic strip stories. Next, we discuss the
      implementation requirements and how they can be met with the available
      technologies, discuss a possible architecture, refine it in the concrete case of 
      the TuCSoN coordination technology, present a subsystem prototype and discuss its
      properties in the Butlers perspective.

      Changing World: A Theoretical Perspective.
PG  - 41-63
AB  - Technologies have become a major force in people’s lives. They change how people 
      interact with the environment, even as the environment changes. We propose that
      technology use in the setting of changing environments is motivated by essential 
      needs and tensions experienced by the individual. We apply three developmental
      and behavioral theories (Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development, Maslow’s
      hierarchy of needs, and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model) to explain
      technology-related behaviors among older adults. We consider how technology use
      has addressed and can address major ecological changes, in three areas: health
      promotion, natural disasters, and disparities. We propose that considering these 
      theories can help researchers and developers ensure that technologies will help
      promote a healthier world for older adults.

      Fall Detection.
LID - e0168069
AB  - During the last years, many research efforts have been devoted to the definition 
      of Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) that benefit from the inherent computing,
      communication and sensing capabilities of smartphones. However, employing a
      smartphone as the unique sensor in a FDS application entails several
      disadvantages as long as an accurate characterization of the patient’s mobility
      may force to transport this personal device on an unnatural position. This paper 
      presents a smartphone-based architecture for the automatic detection of falls.
      The system incorporates a set of small sensing motes that can communicate with
      the smartphone to help in the fall detection decision. The deployed architecture 
      is systematically evaluated in a testbed with experimental users in order to
      determine the number and positions of the sensors that optimize the effectiveness
      of the FDS, as well as to assess the most convenient role of the smartphone in
      the architecture.

TI  - Functional Re-organization of Cortical Networks of Senior Citizens After a
      24-Week Traditional Dance Program.
LID - 422
AB  - Neuroscience is developing rapidly by providing a variety of modern tools for
      analyzing the functional interactions of the brain and detection of pathological 
      deviations due to neurodegeneration. The present study argues that the induction 
      of neuroplasticity of the mature human brain leads to the prevention of dementia.
      Promising solution seems to be the dance programs because they combine cognitive 
      and physical activity in a pleasant way. So, we investigated whether the
      traditional Greek dances can improve the cognitive, physical and functional
      status of the elderly always aiming at promoting active and healthy aging.
      Forty-four participants were randomly assigned equally to the training group and 
      an active control group. The duration of the program was 6 months. Also, the
      participants were evaluated for their physical status and through an
      electroencephalographic (EEG) examination at rest (eyes-closed condition). The
      EEG testing was performed 1–14 days before (pre) and after (post) the training.
      Cortical network analysis was applied by modeling the cortex through a generic
      anatomical model of 20,000 fixed dipoles. These were grouped into 512 cortical
      regions of interest (ROIs). High quality, artifact-free data resulting from an
      elaborate pre-processing pipeline were segmented into multiple, 30 s of
      continuous epochs. Then, functional connectivity among those ROIs was performed
      for each epoch through the relative wavelet entropy (RWE). Synchronization
      matrices were computed and then thresholded in order to provide binary, directed 
      cortical networks of various density ranges. The results showed that the dance
      training improved optimal network performance as estimated by the small-world
      property. Further analysis demonstrated that there were also local network
      changes resulting in better information flow and functional re-organization of
      the network nodes. These results indicate the application of the dance training
      as a possible non-pharmacological intervention for promoting mental and physical 
      well-being of senior citizens. Our results were also compared with a combination 
      of computerized cognitive and physical training, which has already been
      demonstrated to induce neuroplasticity (LLM Care).

AB  - The Aging in Place Project at the University of Missouri (MU) required
      legislation in 1999 and 2001 to be fully realized. An innovative home health
      agency was initiated by the Sinclair School of Nursing specifically to help older
      adults age in place in the environment of their choice. In 2004, an innovative
      independent living environment was built and is operated by a private long term
      care company, as a special facility where residents can truly age in place and
      never fear being moved to a traditional nursing home unless they choose to do so.
      With care provided by the home care agency with registered nurse care
      coordination services, residents receive preventative and early illness
      recognition assistance that have markedly improved their lives. Evaluation of
      aging in place reveal registered nurse care coordination improves outcomes of
      cognition, depression, activities of daily living, incontinence, pain, and
      shortness of breath as well as delaying or preventing nursing home placement.
      Links with MU students, faculty, and nearly every school or college on campus
      enrich the lives of the students and residents of the housing environment.
      Research projects are encouraged and residents who choose to participate are
      enjoying helping with developing cutting technology to help other seniors age in 
      place.

TI  - The State of the Science of Health and Wellness for Adults With Intellectual and 
      Developmental Disabilities.
PG  - 385-98
AB  - Historically, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have 
      experienced health disparities related to several factors including: a lack of
      access to high quality medical care, inadequate preparation of health care
      providers to meet their needs, the social determinants of health (e.g., poverty, 
      race and gender), and the failure to include people with IDD in public health
      efforts and other prevention activities. Over the past decade, a greater effort
      has been made to both identify and begin to address myriad health disparities
      experienced by people with IDD through a variety of activities including programs
      that address health lifestyles and greater attention to the training of health
      care providers. Gaps in the literature include the lack of intervention trials,
      replications of successful approaches, and data that allow for better comparisons
      between people with IDD and without IDD living in the same communities.
      Implications for future research needed to reduce health disparities for people
      with IDD include: better monitoring and treatment for chronic conditions common
      in the general population that are also experienced by people with IDD, an
      enhanced understanding of how to promote health among those in the IDD population
      who are aging, addressing the health needs of people with IDD who are not part of
      the disability service system, developing a better understanding of how to
      include people with IDD in health and wellness programs, and improving methods
      for addressing the healthcare needs of members of this group in an efficient and 
      cost-effective manner, either through better access to general medical care or
      specialized programs.

TI  - The Effect of Online Effort and Reputation of Physicians on Patients’ Choice:
      3-Wave Data Analysis of China’s Good Doctor Website.
LID - e10170
AB  - Background: Nowadays, patients are seeking physician information more frequently 
      via the internet. Physician-rating websites (PRWs) have been recognized as the
      most convenient way to gain insight and detailed information about specific
      physicians before receiving consultation. However, little is known about how the 
      information provided on PRWs may affect patients’ decisions to seek medical
      advice. Objective: This study aimed to examine whether the physicians’ online
      efforts and their reputation have a relationship with patients’ choice of
      physician on PRWs. Methods: A model, based on social exchange theory, was
      developed to analyze the factors associated with the number of online patients. A
      3-wave data collection exercise, covering 4037 physicians on China’s Good Doctor 
      website, was conducted during the months of February, April, and June 2017.
      Increases in consultation in a 60-day period were used as the dependent variable,
      whereas 2 series of data were analyzed using linear regression modeling. The
      fixed-effect model was used to analyze the 3-wave data. Results: The adjusted R2 
      value in the linear regression models were 0.28 and 0.27, whereas in the
      fixed-effect model, it was .30. Both the linear regression and fixed-effect
      models yielded a good fit. A positive effect of physicians’ effort on the
      aggregated number of online patients was identified in all models (R2=0.30 and
      R2=0.37 in 2 regression models; R2=0.23 in fixed effect model; P<.001). The
      proxies of physicians’ reputations indicated different results, with total number
      of page views of physicians’ homepages (R2=0.43 and R2=0.46; R2=0.16; P<.001) and
      number of votes received (R2=0.33 and R2=0.27; R2=0.43; P<.001) being seen as
      positive. Virtual gifts were not significant in all models, whereas thank-you
      messages were only significant in the fixed-effect model (R2=0.11; P=.02). The
      effort made by physicians online is positively associated with their aggregated
      number of patients consulted, whereas the effect of a physician’s reputation
      remains uncertain. The control effect of a physician’s title and hospital’s level
      was not significant in all linear regressions. Conclusions: Both the effort and
      reputation of physicians online contribute to the increased number of online
      patients’ consultation; however, the influence of a physician’s reputation
      varies. This may imply that physicians’ online effort and reputation are critical
      in attracting patients and that strategic manipulation of physician profiles is
      worthy of study. Practical insights are also discussed.

TI  - Fall Detection Devices and their Use with Older Adults: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 178-96
AB  - Background: Falls represent a significant threat to the health and independence
      of adults 65 years of age and older. As a wide variety and large amount of
      passive monitoring systems are currently and increasingly available to detect
      when an individual has fallen, there is a need to analyze and synthesize the
      evidence regarding their ability to accurately detect falls to determine which
      systems are most effective. Objectives: The purpose of this literature review is 
      to systematically assess the current state of design and implementation of fall
      detection devices. This review also examines the extent to which these devices
      have been tested in the real world as well as the acceptability of these devices 
      to older adults. Data sources: A systematic literature review was conducted in
      PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO from their respective inception dates to June
      25, 2013. Study Eligibility Criteria and Interventions: Articles were included if
      they discussed a project or multiple projects involving a system with the purpose
      of detecting a fall in adults. It was not a requirement for inclusion in this
      review that the system targets persons over the age of 65. Articles were excluded
      if they were not written in English or if they looked at fall risk, fall
      detection in children, fall prevention or a Personal Emergency Response device.
      Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were initially divided into those 
      using sensitivity, specificity or accuracy in their evaluation methods, and those
      using other methods to evaluate their devices. Studies were further classified
      into wearable devices and non-wearable devices. Studies were appraised for
      inclusion of older adults in sample and if evaluation included real world
      settings. Results: This review identified 57 projects that used wearable systems 
      and 35 projects using non-wearable systems, regardless of evaluation technique.
      Non-wearable systems included cameras, motion sensors, microphones and floor
      sensors. Of the projects examining wearable systems, only 7.1% reported
      monitoring older adults in a real world setting. There were no studies of
      non-wearable devices that used older adults as subjects in either a lab or a real
      world setting. In general, older adults appear to be interested in using such
      devices although they express concerns over privacy and understanding exactly
      what the device is doing at specific times. Limitations: This systematic review
      was limited to articles written in English and did not include gray literature.
      Manual paper screening and review processes may have been subject to interpretive
      bias. Conclusions and implications of key findings: There exists a large body of 
      working describing various fall detection devices. The challenge in this area is 
      to create highly accurate unobtrusive devices. From this review it appears that
      the technology is becoming more able to accomplish such a task. There is a need
      now for more real world tests as well as standardization of the evaluation of
      these devices.

TI  - Testing a Theory-Based Mobility Monitoring Protocol Using In-Home Sensors: A
      Feasibility Study.
PG  - 253-63
AB  - Mobility is a key factor in the performance of many everyday tasks required for
      independent living as a person grows older. The purpose of this mixed methods
      study was to test a theory-based mobility monitoring protocol by comparing
      sensor-based measures to self-report measures of mobility and assessing the
      acceptability of in-home sensors with older adults. Standardized instruments to
      measure physical, psychosocial and cognitive parameters were administered to 8
      community-dwelling older adults at baseline, 3 month and 6 month visits
      (examples: FES, GDS-SF, Mini-cog). Semi-structured interviews to characterize
      acceptability of the technology were conducted at 3 month and 6 month visits.
      Technical issues prevented comparison of sensor-based measures with self-report
      measures. In-home sensor technology for monitoring mobility is acceptable to
      older adults. Implementing our theory-based mobility monitoring protocol in a
      field study in the homes of older adults is a feasible undertaking but requires
      more robust technology for sensor-based measure validation.

TI  - Designing health insurance information for the Medicare beneficiary: a policy
      synthesis.
PG  - 685-720
AB  - Can Medicare beneficiaries make rational and informed decisions about their
      coverage under the Medicare program? Recent policy developments in the Medicare
      program have been based on the theory of competition in medical care. One of the 
      key assumptions of the competitive model is the free flow of adequate
      information, enabling the consumer to make an informed choice from among the
      various sellers of a particular product. Options for Medicare beneficiaries in
      supplementing their basic Medicare coverage include the purchase of private
      supplementary insurance policies or enrollment in a Medicare HMO. These
      consumers, in a complex health insurance market, have only limited information
      available to them because many health plans do not make adequate comparable
      product information available. Moreover, since the introduction of the Medicare
      HMO option, the long-range plan for management of the Medicare budget has become 
      based on the large-scale voluntary enrollment of beneficiaries into capitated
      health plans. The policy instrument that has been used to improve beneficiary
      decisions on how to supplement Medicare coverage is the informational or
      educational program. This synthesis presents findings regarding the relative
      effectiveness of different types of health insurance information programs for the
      Medicare beneficiary in an effort to promote practical use of the most effective 
      types of information.

TI  - Forecasting Occurrences of Activities.
PG  - 77-91
AB  - While activity recognition has been shown to be valuable for pervasive computing 
      applications, less work has focused on techniques for forecasting the future
      occurrence of activities. We present an activity forecasting method to predict
      the time that will elapse until a target activity occurs. This method generates
      an activity forecast using a regression tree classifier and offers an advantage
      over sequence prediction methods in that it can predict expected time until an
      activity occurs. We evaluate this algorithm on real-world smart home datasets and
      provide evidence that our proposed approach is most effective at predicting
      activity timings.

TI  - Health status, mental health and air quality: evidence from pensioners in Europe.
PG  - 14206-25
AB  - Environmental quality is an important determinant of individuals’ well-being and 
      one of the main concerns of the governments is the improvement on air quality and
      the protection of public health. This is especially the case of sensitive
      demographic groups, such as the old aged people. However, the question this study
      attempts to answer is how do individuals value the effects on the environment.
      The study explores the effects of old and early public pension schemes, as well
      as the impact of air pollution on health status of retired citizens. The
      empirical analysis relies on detailed micro-level data derived from the Survey of
      Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). As proxies for health, we use
      the general health status and the Eurod mental health indicator. We examine two
      air pollutants: the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ground-level ozone (O3). Next, we
      calculate the marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) which shows how much the people 
      are willing to pay for improvement in air quality. We apply various quantitative 
      techniques and approaches, including the fixed effects ordinary least squares
      (OLS) and the fixed effects instrumental variables (IV) approach. The last
      approach is applied to reduce the endogeneity problem coming from possible
      reverse causality between the air pollution, pensions and the health outcomes.
      For robustness check, we apply also a structural equation modelling (SEM) which
      is proper when the outcomes are latent variables. Based on our favoured IV
      estimates and the health status, we find that the MWTP values for one unit
      decrease in SO2 and O3 are respectively €221 and €88 per year. The respective
      MWTP values using the Eurod measure are €155 and €68. Overall, improvement of
      health status implies reduction in health expenditures, and in previous
      literature, ageing has been traditionally considered the most important
      determinant. However, this study shows that health lifestyle and socio-economic
      status, such as education and marital status, are more important, and
      furthermore, air pollution cannot be ignored in the agenda of policy makers.

TI  - Significant Change Spotting for Periodic Human Motion Segmentation of Cleaning
      Tasks Using Wearable Sensors.
LID - 187
AB  - The proportion of the aging population is rapidly increasing around the world,
      which will cause stress on society and healthcare systems. In recent years,
      advances in technology have created new opportunities for automatic activities of
      daily living (ADL) monitoring to improve the quality of life and provide adequate
      medical service for the elderly. Such automatic ADL monitoring requires reliable 
      ADL information on a fine-grained level, especially for the status of interaction
      between body gestures and the environment in the real-world. In this work, we
      propose a significant change spotting mechanism for periodic human motion
      segmentation during cleaning task performance. A novel approach is proposed based
      on the search for a significant change of gestures, which can manage critical
      technical issues in activity recognition, such as continuous data segmentation,
      individual variance, and category ambiguity. Three typical machine learning
      classification algorithms are utilized for the identification of the significant 
      change candidate, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors
      (kNN), and Naive Bayesian (NB) algorithm. Overall, the proposed approach achieves
      96.41% in the F1-score by using the SVM classifier. The results show that the
      proposed approach can fulfill the requirement of fine-grained human motion
      segmentation for automatic ADL monitoring.

TI  - Activity Discovery and Activity Recognition: A New Partnership.
PG  - 820-8
AB  - Activity recognition has received increasing attention from the machine learning 
      community. Of particular interest is the ability to recognize activities in real 
      time from streaming data, but this presents a number of challenges not faced by
      traditional offline approaches. Among these challenges is handling the large
      amount of data that does not belong to a predefined class. In this paper, we
      describe a method by which activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral 
      patterns in observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not
      belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and segmenting it
      into learnable classes. We demonstrate that activity discovery not only sheds
      light on behavioral patterns, but it can also boost the performance of
      recognition algorithms. We introduce this partnership between activity discovery 
      and online activity recognition in the context of the CASAS smart home project
      and validate our approach using CASAS datasets.

TI  - Older adults’ acceptance of a community-based telehealth wellness system.
PG  - 27-36
AB  - The development of ongoing assessment tools to monitor older adult health and
      wellness can support improved quality of life and independence. These
      technologies have often been employed within private residences. Our work
      describes a telehealth kiosk system implemented within a community setting, which
      reduces the costs of installing and maintaining individual systems. Though user
      acceptance of telehealth systems has been studied within the context of home
      residences, this has yet to be addressed for community-based systems. Older
      adults in a retirement community were recruited to use a telehealth system
      including assessment of vital signs and cognitive performance. With a series of
      focus groups (N = 12, average age 79.3 years), we examined user perceptions of
      the telehealth kiosk, addressing issues of usability, effectiveness and privacy. 
      Older adults were favorable towards the collection of health monitoring
      information, recognizing the utility of these data sources. There were issues of 
      usability, especially regarding ergonomics of the telehealth kiosk. We found no
      concerns over privacy, with some participants expressing increased preference for
      the social interactions afforded through the community setting. Understanding the
      social, technical and human factors involved with a community-based telehealth
      system can inform the design of cost-effective health monitoring systems.

      community dwelling older adults.
PG  - 320-33
AB  - Background: Older adults apply various strategies to pursue healthy aging, but we
      know little about their views and use of personal health information to
      accomplish those ends. Methods: As a first step in formulating the role of
      personal health information management (PHIM) in healthy aging, we explored the
      perspectives of older adults on health and health information used in their
      everyday lives through four focus groups with 25 community-dwelling adults aged
      60 and over. Results: We found that the concept of wellness–the holistic and
      multidimensional nature of health and wellbeing–plays prominently in how older
      adults think about health and health information. Participants expressed wellness
      from a position of personal strength, rather than health-related deficits, by
      focusing on wellness activities for staying healthy through: (1) personal health 
      practices, (2) social network support, and (3) residential community engagement. 
      Conclusion: Although these themes involve personal health information, existing
      PHIM systems that focus on disease management are generally not designed to
      support wellness activities. Substantial opportunity exists to fill this wellness
      support gap with innovative health information technology designed for older
      adults. Findings carry implications for the design of PHIM tools that support
      healthy aging and methods for engaging older adults as co-producers of this
      critical support.

TI  - Decision support at home (DS@HOME) – system architectures and requirements.
PG  - 43
AB  - Background: Demographic change with its consequences of an aging society and an
      increase in the demand for care in the home environment has triggered intensive
      research activities in sensor devices and smart home technologies. While many
      advanced technologies are already available, there is still a lack of decision
      support systems (DSS) for the interpretation of data generated in home
      environments. The aim of the research for this paper is to present the
      state-of-the-art in DSS for these data, to define characteristic properties of
      such systems, and to define the requirements for successful home care DSS
      implementations. Methods: A literature review was performed along with the
      analysis of cross-references. Characteristic properties are proposed and
      requirements are derived from the available body of literature. Results: 79
      papers were identified and analyzed, of which 20 describe implementations of
      decision components. Most authors mention server-based decision support
      components, but only few papers provide details about the system architecture or 
      the knowledge base. A list of requirements derived from the analysis is
      presented. Among the primary drawbacks of current systems are the missing
      integration of DSS in current health information system architectures including
      interfaces, the missing agreement among developers with regard to the
      formalization and customization of medical knowledge and a lack of intelligent
      algorithms to interpret data from multiple sources including clinical application
      systems. Conclusions: Future research needs to address these issues in order to
      provide useful information – and not only large amounts of data – for both the
      patient and the caregiver. Furthermore, there is a need for outcome studies
      allowing for identifying successful implementation concepts.

PG  - 527-39
AB  - The machine learning and pervasive sensing technologies found in smart homes
      offer unprecedented opportunities for providing health monitoring and assistance 
      to individuals experiencing difficulties living independently at home. In order
      to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design
      technologies that recognize and track activities that people normally perform as 
      part of their daily routines. Although approaches do exist for recognizing
      activities, the approaches are applied to activities that have been pre-selected 
      and for which labeled training data is available. In contrast, we introduce an
      automated approach to activity tracking that identifies frequent activities that 
      naturally occur in an individual’s routine. With this capability we can then
      track the occurrence of regular activities to monitor functional health and to
      detect changes in an individual’s patterns and lifestyle. In this paper we
      describe our activity mining and tracking approach and validate our algorithms on
      data collected in physical smart environments.

TI  - Older Adults’ Satisfaction with a Medication Dispensing Device in Home Care.
PG  - 211-22
AB  - Introduction: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions face the complex task
      of medication management involving multiple medications of varying doses at
      different times. Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home-based 
      devices for medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We
      examined older adults’ perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device
      as part of a clinical trial involving home health care clients, nurse
      coordination and use of the medication dispensing device. Methods: Ninety-six
      frail older adult participants who used the medication dispensing device for 12
      months completed a satisfaction survey related to perceived usefulness and
      reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped by themes in the following areas: 
      Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management Assistance, Routine Task
      Performance and Acceptability. Results: Nearly all participants perceived the
      medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in
      management of their medications. Eighty-four percent of participants expressed a 
      desire to use the machine in the future. Conclusion: The technology-enhanced
      medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool for older adults
      to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. Improved usability
      and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future research. Trial

TI  - Using the eServices Platform for Detecting Behavior Patterns Deviation in the
      Elderly Assisted Living: A Case Study.
LID - 530828
AB  - World's aging population is rising and the elderly are increasingly isolated
      socially and geographically. As a consequence, in many situations, they need
      assistance that is not granted in time. In this paper, we present a solution that
      follows the CRISP-DM methodology to detect the elderly's behavior pattern
      deviations that may indicate possible risk situations. To obtain these patterns, 
      many variables are aggregated to ensure the alert system reliability and minimize
      eventual false positive alert situations. These variables comprehend information 
      provided by body area network (BAN), by environment sensors, and also by the
      elderly's interaction in a service provider platform, called eServices—Elderly
      Support Service Platform. eServices is a scalable platform aggregating a service 
      ecosystem developed specially for elderly people. This pattern recognition will
      further activate the adequate response. With the system evolution, it will learn 
      to predict potential danger situations for a specified user, acting preventively 
      and ensuring the elderly's safety and well-being. As the eServices platform is
      still in development, synthetic data, based on real data sample and empiric
      knowledge, is being used to populate the initial dataset. The presented work is a
      proof of concept of knowledge extraction using the eServices platform
      information. Regardless of not using real data, this work proves to be an asset, 
      achieving a good performance in preventing alert situations.

TI  - Autonomous Unobtrusive Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults.
PG  - 1383-94
AB  - The current diagnosis process of dementia is resulting in a high-percentage of
      cases with delayed detection. To address this problem, in this paper we explore
      the feasibility of autonomously detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the 
      older adult population. We implement a signal processing approach equipped with a
      machine learning paradigm to process and analyze real world data acquired using
      home-based unobtrusive sensing technologies. Using the sensor and clinical data
      pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of 3 years, a number
      of measures associated with the subjects' walking speeds and general activity in 
      the home were calculated. Different time spans of these measures were used to
      generate feature vectors to train and test two machine learning algorithms namely
      support vector machines and random forests. We were able to autonomously detect
      MCI in older adults with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under
      the precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks. This work is 
      of great significance since it can potentially assist in the early detection of
      cognitive impairment in older adults.

TI  - Visualization approaches to support healthy aging: A systematic review.
PG  - 860
AB  - Background: Informatics tools have the potential to support the growing number of
      older adults who are aging in place. Many tools include visualizations (data
      visualizations and visualizations of physical representations). However, the role
      of visualizations in supporting aging in place remains largely unexplored.
      Objective: To synthesize and identify gaps in the literature evaluating
      visualizations (data visualizations and visualizations of physical
      representations) for informatics tools to support healthy aging. Methods: We
      conducted a search in CINAHL, Embase, Engineering Village, PsycINFO, PubMed, and 
      Web of Science using a priori defined terms for publications in English
      describing community-based studies evaluating visualizations used by adults aged 
      ≥ 65 years. Results: Six out of the identified 251 publications were eligible.
      Most studies described in the publications were user studies and all varied
      methodological quality. Three publications described visualizations of virtual
      representations supported performing at-home exercises. Participants found visual
      representations either (1) helpful, motivational, and supported their
      understanding of their health behaviours or (2) not an improvement over
      alternatives. Three publications described data visualizations that aimed to
      support understanding of one’s health. Participants were able to interpret data
      visualizations that used precise data and encodings that were more concrete
      better than those that did not provide precision or were abstract. Participants
      found data visualizations helpful in understanding their overall health and
      granular data. Conclusions: Few studies were identified that used and evaluated
      visualizations for older adults to promote engagement in exercises or
      understanding of their health. While visualizations demonstrated some promise to 
      support older adult users in these activities, the studies had various
      methodological limitations. More research is needed, including research that
      overcomes methodological limitations of studies we identified, to develop
      visualizations that older adults could use with ease and accuracy to support
      their health behaviours and decision making.

TI  - Green Communication for Wireless Body Area Networks: Energy Aware Link Efficient 
      Routing Approach.
LID - 3237
AB  - Recent technological advancement in wireless communication has led to the
      invention of wireless body area networks (WBANs), a cutting-edge technology in
      healthcare applications. WBANs interconnect with intelligent and miniaturized
      biomedical sensor nodes placed on human body to an unattended monitoring of
      physiological parameters of the patient. These sensors are equipped with limited 
      resources in terms of computation, storage, and battery power. The data
      communication in WBANs is a resource hungry process, especially in terms of
      energy. One of the most significant challenges in this network is to design
      energy efficient next-hop node selection framework. Therefore, this paper
      presents a green communication framework focusing on an energy aware link
      efficient routing approach for WBANs (ELR-W). Firstly, a link efficiency-oriented
      network model is presented considering beaconing information and network
      initialization process. Secondly, a path cost calculation model is derived
      focusing on energy aware link efficiency. A complete operational framework ELR-W 
      is developed considering energy aware next-hop link selection by utilizing the
      network and path cost model. The comparative performance evaluation attests the
      energy-oriented benefit of the proposed framework as compared to the
      state-of-the-art techniques. It reveals a significant enhancement in body area
      networking in terms of various energy-oriented metrics under medical
      environments.

TI  - How to Tackle Key Challenges in the Promotion of Physical Activity among Older
      Adults (65+): The AEQUIPA Network Approach.
LID - 379
AB  - The paper introduces the theoretical framework and methods/instruments used by
      the Physical Activity and Health Equity: Primary Prevention for Healthy Ageing
      (AEQUIPA) prevention research network as an interdisciplinary approach to tackle 
      key challenges in the promotion of physical activity among older people (65+).
      Drawing on the social-ecological model, the AEQUIPA network developed an
      interdisciplinary methodological design including quantitative/qualitative
      studies and systematic reviews, while combining expertise from diverse fields:
      public health, psychology, urban planning, sports sciences, health technology and
      geriatrics. AEQUIPA tackles key challenges when promoting physical activity (PA) 
      in older adults: tailoring of interventions, fostering community readiness and
      participation, strengthening intersectoral collaboration, using new technological
      devices and evaluating intervention generated inequalities. AEQUIPA aims to
      strengthen the evidence base for age-specific preventive PA interventions and to 
      yield new insights into the explanatory power of individual and contextual
      factors. Currently, the empirical work is still underway. First experiences
      indicate that the network has achieved a strong regional linkage with
      communities, local stakeholders and individuals. However, involving inactive
      persons and individuals from minority groups remained challenging. A review of
      existing PA intervention studies among the elderly revealed the potential to
      assess equity effects. The results will add to the theoretical and methodological
      discussion on evidence-based age-specific PA interventions and will contribute to
      the discussion about European and national health targets.

TI  - A Physical Activity Reference Data-Set Recorded from Older Adults Using Body-Worn
      Inertial Sensors and Video Technology—The ADAPT Study Data-Set.
LID - 559
AB  - Physical activity monitoring algorithms are often developed using conditions that
      do not represent real-life activities, not developed using the target population,
      or not labelled to a high enough resolution to capture the true detail of human
      movement. We have designed a semi-structured supervised laboratory-based activity
      protocol and an unsupervised free-living activity protocol and recorded 20 older 
      adults performing both protocols while wearing up to 12 body-worn sensors.
      Subjects’ movements were recorded using synchronised cameras (≥25 fps), both
      deployed in a laboratory environment to capture the in-lab portion of the
      protocol and a body-worn camera for out-of-lab activities. Video labelling of the
      subjects’ movements was performed by five raters using 11 different category
      labels. The overall level of agreement was high (percentage of agreement >90.05%,
      and Cohen’s Kappa, corrected kappa, Krippendorff’s alpha and Fleiss’ kappa
      >0.86). A total of 43.92 h of activities were recorded, including 9.52 h of
      in-lab and 34.41 h of out-of-lab activities. A total of 88.37% and 152.01% of
      planned transitions were recorded during the in-lab and out-of-lab scenarios,
      respectively. This study has produced the most detailed dataset to date of
      inertial sensor data, synchronised with high frame-rate (≥25 fps) video labelled 
      data recorded in a free-living environment from older adults living
      independently. This dataset is suitable for validation of existing activity
      classification systems and development of new activity classification algorithms.

TI  - A Deep-Learning Model for Subject-Independent Human Emotion Recognition Using
      Electrodermal Activity Sensors.
LID - 1659
AB  - One of the main objectives of Active and Assisted Living (AAL) environments is to
      ensure that elderly and/or disabled people perform/live well in their immediate
      environments; this can be monitored by among others the recognition of emotions
      based on non-highly intrusive sensors such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
      sensors. However, designing a learning system or building a machine-learning
      model to recognize human emotions while training the system on a specific group
      of persons and testing the system on a totally a new group of persons is still a 
      serious challenge in the field, as it is possible that the second testing group
      of persons may have different emotion patterns. Accordingly, the purpose of this 
      paper is to contribute to the field of human emotion recognition by proposing a
      Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which ensures promising
      robustness-related results for both subject-dependent and subject-independent
      human emotion recognition. The CNN model has been trained using a grid search
      technique which is a model hyperparameter optimization technique to fine-tune the
      parameters of the proposed CNN architecture. The overall concept’s performance is
      validated and stress-tested by using MAHNOB and DEAP datasets. The results
      demonstrate a promising robustness improvement regarding various evaluation
      metrics. We could increase the accuracy for subject-independent classification to
      78% and 82% for MAHNOB and DEAP respectively and to 81% and 85% subject-dependent
      classification for MAHNOB and DEAP respectively (4 classes/labels). The work
      shows clearly that while using solely the non-intrusive EDA sensors a robust
      classification of human emotion is possible even without involving
      additional/other physiological signals.

TI  - The organising vision for telehealth and telecare: discourse analysis.
LID - e001574
AB  - Objective: To (1) map how different stakeholders understand telehealth and
      telecare technologies and (2) explore the implications for development and
      implementation of telehealth and telecare services. Design: Discourse analysis.
      Sample: 68 publications representing diverse perspectives (academic, policy,
      service, commercial and lay) on telehealth and telecare plus field notes from 10 
      knowledge-sharing events. Method: Following a familiarisation phase (browsing and
      informal interviews), we studied a systematic sample of texts in detail. Through 
      repeated close reading, we identified assumptions, metaphors, storylines,
      scenarios, practices and rhetorical positions. We added successive findings to an
      emerging picture of the whole. Main findings: Telehealth and telecare
      technologies featured prominently in texts on chronic illness and ageing. There
      was no coherent organising vision. Rather, four conflicting discourses were
      evident and engaged only minimally with one another's arguments. Modernist
      discourse presented a futuristic utopian vision in which assistive technologies, 
      implemented at scale, would enable society to meet its moral obligations to older
      people by creating a safe ‘smart’ home environment where help was always at hand,
      while generating efficiency savings. Humanist discourse emphasised the uniqueness
      and moral worth of the individual and tailoring to personal and family context;
      it considered that technologies were only sometimes fit for purpose and could
      create as well as solve problems. Political economy discourse envisaged a
      techno-economic complex of powerful vested interests driving commodification of
      healthcare and diversion of public funds into private business. Change management
      discourse recognised the complicatedness of large-scale technology programmes and
      emphasised good project management and organisational processes. Conclusion:
      Introduction of telehealth and telecare is hampered because different
      stakeholders hold different assumptions, values and world views, ‘talk past’ each
      other and compete for recognition and resources. If investments in these
      technologies are to bear fruit, more effective inter-stakeholder dialogue must
      occur to establish an organising vision that better accommodates competing
      discourses.

TI  - Needs and preferences for technology among Chinese family caregivers of persons
      with dementia: A pilot study.
LID - 2055668318775315
AB  - Background: Dementia is a major public health concern associated with significant
      caregiver demands and there are technologies available to assist with caregiving.
      However, there is a paucity of information on caregiver needs and preferences for
      these technologies, especially among Chinese family caregivers of persons with
      dementia in Canada. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the
      technology needs and preferences of Chinese family caregivers of persons with
      dementia with a sex and gender lens in Canada. Methods: A cross-sectional survey 
      was conducted through the Yee Hong Centre of Geriatric Care in Canada. Frequency 
      distributions, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, and multiple regression analyses were 
      performed. Results: The majority of the 40 respondents did not demonstrate
      knowledge about technology to assist with caregiving. Ease of installation and
      reliability were identified as the most important features when installing and
      using technology respectively. Respondents demonstrated a positive attitude
      towards the use of technology during caregiving. Controlling for age, female
      respondents were significantly more receptive of technology. Conclusions: Our
      findings suggest a need to increase awareness of technology options to assist
      caregiving in this ethnic population and provide insight for future development
      and marketing of technology that better align with caregivers’ needs.

TI  - GERONTECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE CONTINUUM: FROM INDEPENDENT TO ASSISTED LIVING.
PG  - 683
AB  - The dramatic growth in the world’s older population will have a significant
      effect on healthcare, social services, communities, and families; it will require
      innovative interdisciplinary solutions. The emergence of gerontechnology may
      address many aging-related challenges in the continuum of care for older adults. 
      Telehealth, combined with patient education, engages independent
      community-dwelling chronically ill older adults in their own care.
      Health-assistive smart homes assist independent and assisted-living older adults 
      with safety and health via ambient motion sensors and machine learning algorithms
      that may identify and predict health events, as well as provide timely alerts to 
      facilitate earlier interventions. Mindful implementation and evaluation of the
      efficacy of gerontechnologies will be needed as more technological solutions
      become available and are employed. A focus on personhood and an emphasis on
      patient-centered care will help ensure safe and ethical use of technology, which 
      is designed by digital natives for use by a non-digital native older adult
      population. In this symposium, we will present research findings from four
      distinct studies that describe: (a) the implementation and evaluation of smart
      home sensors or telehealth technology for remote patient monitoring in community 
      and institutional settings and (b) the challenges to adoption of such
      technologies among older adults. We will also discuss the need for health care
      and human service professionals to be cognizant of technological resources in
      order to increase adoption and implementation. Gerontechnology may improve
      quality of life among older adults, increase their ability to age-in-place, and
      decrease health care costs while maintaining function and dignity.

TI  - Survey on Fall Detection and Fall Prevention Using Wearable and External Sensors.
PG  - 19806-42
AB  - According to nihseniorhealth.gov (a website for older adults), falling represents
      a great threat as people get older, and providing mechanisms to detect and
      prevent falls is critical to improve people's lives. Over 1.6 million U.S. adults
      are treated for fall-related injuries in emergency rooms every year suffering
      fractures, loss of independence, and even death. It is clear then, that this
      problem must be addressed in a prompt manner, and the use of pervasive computing 
      plays a key role to achieve this. Fall detection (FD) and fall prevention (FP)
      are research areas that have been active for over a decade, and they both strive 
      for improving people's lives through the use of pervasive computing. This paper
      surveys the state of the art in FD and FP systems, including qualitative
      comparisons among various studies. It aims to serve as a point of reference for
      future research on the mentioned systems. A general description of FD and FP
      systems is provided, including the different types of sensors used in both
      approaches. Challenges and current solutions are presented and described in great
      detail. A 3-level taxonomy associated with the risk factors of a fall is
      proposed. Finally, cutting edge FD and FP systems are thoroughly reviewed and
      qualitatively compared, in terms of design issues and other parameters.

TI  - Tablet-Based Well-Being Check for the Elderly: Development and Evaluation of
      Usability and Acceptability.
LID - e12
AB  - Background: Many elderly people prefer to live at home independently. One of the 
      major concerns raised by the family members is the safety and well-being of their
      elderly family members when living independently in a home environment. To
      address this issue, assistive technology solutions have been available in the
      market. Despite their availability and proliferation, these types of solutions
      are not popular with the elderly due to their intrusive nature, privacy-related
      issues, social stigma, and fear of losing human interaction. This study shares
      the experience in the development of a digital photo frame system that helps
      family members to check the well-being of the elderly, exploiting their desire to
      remain socially connected. Objectives: The aim of this study was to iteratively
      design, implement, and assess the usability, user friendliness, and acceptability
      of a tablet-based system to check the well-being of the elderly. Methods: Our
      study methodology comprises three separate stages: initial system development,
      contextual assessment, and comparative case study evaluation. Results: In the
      first stage, requirements were elicited from the elderly to design a well-being
      check prototype. In the second stage, areas for improvements (eg, privacy
      features) were identified. Also, additional features (such as medication prompts 
      or food reminders) were suggested to help aged and health care service providers 
      with effective but subtle monitoring of the elderly. These would lower their
      operating cost by reducing visits by care providers to the homes of the elderly. 
      In the third stage, the results highlighted the difference (between users in
      India and Australia) in the levels of familiarity of the elderly with this
      technology. Some elderly participants at the Kalyani Institute for Study,
      Planning and Action for Rural Change, India latched onto this technology quickly 
      while a few refused to use the system. However, in all cases, the support of
      family members was crucial for their willingness to use the technology.
      Conclusions: This project has three major outcomes. First, a picture frame
      prototype was tested with the elderly to leverage the benefits of social
      communication. Second, the project helped us test and implement the “Silvercare” 
      model for supporting the elderly through young retired people residing in the
      area. Finally, the project helped formalize the agile three-stage design
      methodology to develop information technology solutions for the elderly. Also,
      the project contributed to an ongoing European Union Project called Victoryahome,
      which involves more than 50 sites across 5 countries (Norway, Sweden,
      Netherlands, Portugal, and Australia) to assess the use of telepresence robots,
      wearable fall detectors, and medication dispensers for the elderly living
      independently.

TI  - User Requirements for Technology to Assist Aging in Place: Qualitative Study of
      Older People and Their Informal Support Networks.
LID - e10741
AB  - Background: Informal support is essential for enabling many older people to age
      in place. However, there is limited research examining the information needs of
      older adults’ informal support networks and how these could be met through home
      monitoring and information and communication technologies. Objective: The purpose
      of this study was to investigate how technologies that connect older adults to
      their informal and formal support networks could assist aging in place and
      enhance older adults’ health and well-being. Methods: Semistructured interviews
      were conducted with 10 older adults and a total of 31 members of their
      self-identified informal support networks. They were asked questions about their 
      information needs and how technology could support the older adults to age in
      place. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results: The
      analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) the social enablers theme,
      which outlined how timing, informal support networks, and safety concerns assist 
      the older adults’ uptake of technology, (2) the technology concerns theme, which 
      outlined concerns about cost, usability, information security and privacy, and
      technology superseding face-to-face contact, and (3) the information desired
      theme, which outlined what information should be collected and transferred and
      who should make decisions about this. Conclusions: Older adults and their
      informal support networks may be receptive to technology that monitors older
      adults within the home if it enables aging in place for longer. However, cost,
      privacy, security, and usability barriers would need to be considered and the
      system should be individualizable to older adults’ changing needs. The user
      requirements identified from this study and described in this paper have informed
      the development of a technology that is currently being prototyped.

      is, on the one hand, to analyze the extent to which technology is present in
      terms of its relationship with frailty and what technological resources are used 
      to treat it. Its other purpose is to define new challenges and contributions made
      by physiotherapy using technology. Eighty documents related to research,
      validation and/or the ascertaining of different types of hardware, software or
      both were reviewed in prominent areas. The authors used the following scales: in 
      the area of diagnosis, Fried’s phenotype model of frailty and a model based on
      trials for the design of devices. The technologies developed that are based on
      these models accounted for 55% and 45% of cases respectively. In the area of
      prevention, the results proved similar regarding the use of wireless sensors with
      cameras (35.71%), and Kinect™ sensors (28.57%) to analyze movements and postures 
      that indicate a risk of falling. In the area of care, results were found
      referring to the use of different motion, physiological and environmental
      wireless sensors (46,15%), i.e. so-called smart homes. In the area of treatment, 
      the results show with a percentage of 37.5% that the Nintendo® Wii™ console is
      the most used tool for treating frailty in elderly persons. Further work needs to
      be carried out to reduce the gap existing between technology, frail elderly
      persons, healthcare professionals and carers to bring together the different
      views about technology. This need raises the challenge of developing and
      implementing technology in physiotherapy via serious games that may via play and 
      connectivity help to improve the functional capacity, general health and quality 
      of life of frail individuals.

TI  - Home Care Technology Through an Ability Expectation Lens.
LID - e155
AB  - Home care is on the rise, and its delivery is increasingly reliant on an
      expanding variety of health technologies ranging from computers to telephone
      “health apps” to social robots. These technologies are most often predicated on
      expectations that people in their homes (1) can actively interact with these
      technologies and (2) are willing to submit to the action of the technology in
      their home. Our purpose is to use an “ability expectations” lens to bring
      together, and provide some synthesis of, the types of utility and disadvantages
      that can arise for people with disabilities in relation to home care technology
      development and use. We searched the academic databases Scopus, Web of Science,
      EBSCO ALL, IEEE Xplore, and Compendex to collect articles that had the term “home
      care technology” in the abstract or as a topic (in the case of Web of Science).
      We also used our background knowledge and related academic literature pertaining 
      to self-diagnosis, health monitoring, companionship, health information
      gathering, and care. We examined background articles and articles collected
      through our home care technology search in terms of ability expectations assumed 
      in the presentation of home care technologies, or discussed in relation to home
      care technologies. While advances in health care support are made possible
      through emerging technologies, we urge critical examination of such technologies 
      in terms of implications for the rights and dignity of people with diverse
      abilities. Specifically, we see potential for technologies to result in new forms
      of exclusion and powerlessness. Ableism influences choices made by funders,
      policy makers, and the public in the development and use of home health
      technologies and impacts how people with disabilities are served and how useful
      health support technologies will be for them. We urge continued critical
      examination of technology development and use according to ability expectations, 
      and we recommend increasing incorporation of participatory design processes to
      counteract potential for health support technology to render people with
      disabilities technologically excluded and powerless.

TI  - Mitigating Burden Associated With Informal Caregiving.
PG  - 50-5
AB  - Informal caregiving is the most common form of long-term care provided in the
      United States, and with the projected rapid growth of older adults, informal
      caregiving will be even more critical in the foreseeable future. In the United
      States, slightly more than 20% of informal caregivers provide care for more than 
      one care recipient, and 10% provide care for three or more care recipients.
      Caring for a dependent, older adult patient may have negative effects on
      physical, psychological, psychosocial, social and financial health of caregivers.
      Careful assessment of the impact of informal caregiving on the caregiver’s
      functioning is imperative, and will enable a practitioner to not only find ways
      to help caregivers shoulder the effects of caregiving, but also to measure the
      effectiveness of interventions that seek to mitigate the effects of caregiving.

TI  - Non-contact Pressure-based Sleep/Wake Discrimination.
PG  - 1750-60
AB  - Poor sleep is increasingly being recognised as an important prognostic parameter 
      of health. For those with suspected sleep disorders, patients are referred to
      sleep clinics which guide treatment. However, sleep clinics are not always a
      viable option due to their high cost, a lack of experienced practitioners,
      lengthy waiting lists and an unrepresentative sleeping environment. A home-based 
      non-contact sleep/wake monitoring system may be used as a guide for treatment
      potentially stratifying patients by clinical need or highlighting longitudinal
      changes in sleep and nocturnal patterns. This paper presents the evaluation of an
      under-mattress sleep monitoring system for non-contact sleep/wake discrimination.
      A large dataset of sensor data with concomitant sleep/wake state was collected
      from both younger and older adults participating in a circadian sleep study. A
      thorough training/testing/validation procedure was configured and optimised
      feature extraction and sleep/wake discrimination algorithms evaluated both within
      and across the two cohorts. An accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 74.3%,
      95.5%, and 53.2% is reported over all subjects using an external validation
      dataset (71.9%, 87.9% and 56%, and 77.5%, 98% and 57% is reported for younger and
      older subjects respectively). These results compare favourably with similar
      research, however this system provides an ambient alternative suitable for long
      term continuous sleep monitoring, particularly amongst vulnerable populations.

TI  - Care robots for the supermarket shelf: a product gap in assistive technologies.
PG  - 763-81
AB  - The literature on the development of assistive robots is dominated by
      technological papers with little consideration of how such devices might be
      commercialised for a mass market at a price that is affordable for older people
      and their families as well as public services and care insurers. This article
      argues that the focus of technical development in this field is too ambitious,
      neglecting the potential market for an affordable device that is aleady in the
      realm of the ‘adjacent possible’ given current technology capabilities. It also
      questions on both ethical and marketing grounds the current effort to develop
      assistive robots with pet-like or human-like features. The marketing literature
      on ‘really new products’ has so far not appeared to inform the development of
      assistive robots but has some important lessons. These include using analogies
      with existing products and giving particular attention to the role of early
      adopters. Relevant analogies for care robots are not animals or humans but useful
      domestic appliances and personal technologies with attractive designs, engaging
      functionality and intuitive usability. This points to a strategy for enabling
      mass adoption – which has so far eluded even conventional telecare – of
      emphasising how such an appliance is part of older people's contemporary
      lifestyles rather than a sign of age-related decline and loss of independence.

PG  - 49-66
AB  - Aim:: To explore the use ofthe Ecological Validity Model as a guiding framework
      in the provision of a culturally-sensitive assistive technology (AT) intervention
      for community older people. Methods:: Twenty-seven Hispanic adultsaged 70 years
      and older, and four individuals with expertisein AT participated in a concurrent 
      nested mixed method study where the quantitative method (content validity ratio
      exercise) was embedded in the dominant qualitative method (focus groups).
      Results:: Findings informedthe development of the Assistive Technology Life
      Enhancement Program (ATLEP); an intervention consisting of seven modules
      addressing AT devices with culturally sensitive elements. Conclusions:: The
      Ecological Validity Model, as well as, the input from older adults were both
      effective methodological strategies in tailoring the ATLEP intervention to the
      needs and circumstances of community-living older people living in Puerto Rico.

TI  - Health information technologies in geriatrics and gerontology: a mixed systematic
      review.
PG  - 1109-19
AB  - Objective: To review, categorize, and synthesize findings from the literature
      about the application of health information technologies in geriatrics and
      gerontology (GGHIT). Materials and Methods: This mixed-method systematic review
      is based on a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and ABI/Inform
      Global. Study selection and coding were performed independently by two
      researchers and were followed by a narrative synthesis. To move beyond a simple
      description of the technologies, we employed and adapted the diffusion of
      innovation theory (DOI). Results: 112 papers were included. Analysis revealed
      five main types of GGHIT: (1) telecare technologies (representing half of the
      studies); (2) electronic health records; (3) decision support systems; (4)
      web-based packages for patients and/or family caregivers; and (5) assistive
      information technologies. On aggregate, the most consistent finding proves to be 
      the positive outcomes of GGHIT in terms of clinical processes. Although less
      frequently studied, positive impacts were found on patients’ health,
      productivity, efficiency and costs, clinicians’ satisfaction, patients’
      satisfaction and patients’ empowerment. Discussion: Further efforts should focus 
      on improving the characteristics of such technologies in terms of compatibility
      and simplicity. Implementation strategies also should be improved as trialability
      and observability are insufficient. Conclusions: Our results will help
      organizations in making decisions regarding the choice, planning and diffusion of
      GGHIT implemented for the care of older adults.

TI  - Physical Activity Levels and Patterns in Older Adults: The Influence of a
      DVD-Based Exercise Program.
PG  - 91-7
AB  - The use of multimedia to influence health behaviors offers unique advantages over
      more traditional center-based programs, however, little is known about the
      effectiveness of such approaches in improving physical activity levels over time.
      The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a progressive and
      age-appropriate, DVD-delivered exercise program in promoting physical activity
      levels among older adult cohorts. Community dwelling older adults (N=307, Mean
      age=71 years) were randomized to one of two groups: a 6-month home-based
      DVD-delivered exercise program i.e. the FlexToBa intervention group or a healthy 
      aging DVD control group. Physical activity was assessed objectively using a
      standard 7-day accelerometer wear period and subjectively using the Godin Leisure
      Time Exercise Questionnaire, at baseline and follow-up. ANCOVAs indicated a
      statistically significant treatment effect for subjectively [F (1,250) = 8.42, P 
      = .004, η2 = .03] and objectively [F (1,240) = 3.77, P = .05, η2 = .02] measured 
      physical activity. The older cohort (>70) in the FlexToBa condition further had
      significantly larger improvements in physical activity levels compared to their
      younger counterparts. From a public health perspective, media-delivered
      interventions such as the FlexToBa program might prove to be cost-effective, have
      a broader reach and at the same time be effective in improving physical activity 
      levels in older adults.

TI  - Evaluating the Economic Impact of Smart Care Platforms: Qualitative and
      Quantitative Results of a Case Study.
LID - e33
AB  - Background: In response to the increasing pressure of the societal challenge
      because of a graying society, a gulf of new Information and Communication
      Technology (ICT) supported care services (eCare) can now be noticed. Their common
      goal is to increase the quality of care while decreasing its costs. Smart Care
      Platforms (SCPs), installed in the homes of care-dependent people, foster the
      interoperability of these services and offer a set of eCare services that are
      complementary on one platform. These eCare services could not only result in more
      quality care for care receivers, but they also offer opportunities to care
      providers to optimize their processes. Objective: The objective of the study was 
      to identify and describe the expected added values and impacts of integrating
      SCPs in current home care delivery processes for all actors. In addition, the
      potential economic impact of SCP deployment is quantified from the perspective of
      home care organizations. Methods: Semistructured and informal interviews and
      focus groups and cocreation workshops with service providers, managers of home
      care organizations, and formal and informal care providers led to the
      identification of added values of SCP integration. In a second step, process
      breakdown analyses of home care provisioning allowed defining the operational
      impact for home care organization. Impacts on 2 different process steps of
      providing home care were quantified. After modeling the investment, an economic
      evaluation compared the business as usual (BAU) scenario versus the integrated
      SCP scenario. Results: The added value of SCP integration for all actors involved
      in home care was identified. Most impacts were qualitative such as increase in
      peace of mind, better quality of care, strengthened involvement in care
      provisioning, and more transparent care communication. For home care
      organizations, integrating SCPs could lead to a decrease of 38% of the current
      annual expenses for two administrative process steps namely, care rescheduling
      and the billing for care provisioning. Conclusions: Although integrating SCP in
      home care processes could affect both the quality of life of the care receiver
      and informal care giver, only scarce and weak evidence was found that supports
      this assumption. In contrast, there exists evidence that indicates the lack of
      the impact on quality of life of the care receiver while it increases the cost of
      care provisioning. However, our cost-benefit quantification model shows that
      integrating SCPs in home care provisioning could lead to a considerable decrease 
      of costs for care administrative tasks. Because of this cost decreasing impact,
      we believe that the integration of SCPs will be driven by home care organizations
      instead of the care receivers themselves.

PG  - 90-104
AB  - The pervasive sensing technologies found in smart environments offer
      unprecedented opportunities for monitoring and assisting the individuals who live
      and work in these spaces. An aspect of daily life that is important for one's
      emotional and physical health is social interaction. In this paper we investigate
      the use of smart environment technologies to detect and analyze interactions in
      smart spaces. We introduce techniques for collect and analyzing sensor
      information in smart environments to help in interpreting resident behavior
      patterns and determining when multiple residents are interacting. The
      effectiveness of our techniques is evaluated using two physical smart environment
      testbeds.

TI  - Reactions to a Remote-Controlled Video-Communication Robot in Seniors' Homes: A
      Pilot Study of Feasibility and Acceptance.
PG  - 755-9
AB  - Objective:Remote telepresence provided by tele-operated robotics represents a new
      means for obtaining important health information, improving older adults' social 
      and daily functioning and providing peace of mind to family members and
      caregivers who live remotely. In this study we tested the feasibility of use and 
      acceptance of a remotely controlled robot with video-communication capability in 
      independently living, cognitively intact older adults.Materials and Methods:A
      mobile remotely controlled robot with video-communication ability was placed in
      the homes of eight seniors. The attitudes and preferences of these volunteers and
      those of family or friends who communicated with them remotely via the device
      were assessed through survey instruments.Results:Overall experiences were
      consistently positive, with the exception of one user who subsequently progressed
      to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Responses from our participants
      indicated that in general they appreciated the potential of this technology to
      enhance their physical health and well-being, social connectedness, and ability
      to live independently at home. Remote users, who were friends or adult children
      of the participants, were more likely to test the mobility features and had
      several suggestions for additional useful applications.Conclusions:Results from
      the present study showed that a small sample of independently living, cognitively
      intact older adults and their remote collaterals responded positively to a remote
      controlled robot with video-communication capabilities. Research is needed to
      further explore the feasibility and acceptance of this type of technology with a 
      variety of patients and their care contacts.

TI  - What Do Users Want From “Smart” Wheelchairs?
LID - 263
AB  - Technological advances have made it possible to integrate a variety of functions 
      into “smart” wheelchairs that include robotics but also sensors that support
      telehealth and communication applications. The purpose of this study was to
      identify possible features that current older adult wheelchair users identify as 
      being most helpful and most important and to use scenarios to determine
      acceptability of potential features. A small pilot study including 5 wheelchair
      users residing an assisted living facility was conducted that included a
      questionnaire and a focus group. The participants identified safety-related
      features as most helpful and important. Within the scenarios presented, the
      safety-related features were identified as highly acceptable. Features that were 
      available with current technology (e.g. communication with family) were least
      highly rated. While more research is needed on user preferences, “smart”
      wheelchair developers will want to include user preferences and focus on safety
      and telehealth features.

TI  - Naturalistic Assessment of Everyday Activities and Prompting Technologies in Mild
      Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 442-52
AB  - Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often have difficulty
      performing complex instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which are
      critical to independent living. In this study, amnestic multi-domain MCI (N =
      29), amnestic single-domain MCI (N = 18), and healthy older participants (N = 47)
      completed eight scripted IADLs (e.g., cook oatmeal on the stove) in a smart
      apartment testbed. We developed and experimented with a graded hierarchy of
      technology-based prompts to investigate both the amount of prompting and type of 
      prompts required to assist individuals with MCI in completing the activities.
      When task errors occurred, progressive levels of assistance were provided,
      starting with the lowest level needed to adjust performance. Results showed that 
      the multi-domain MCI group made more errors and required more prompts than the
      single-domain MCI and healthy older adult groups. Similar to the other two
      groups, the multi-domain MCI group responded well to the indirect prompts and did
      not need a higher level of prompting to get back on track successfully with the
      tasks. Need for prompting assistance was best predicted by verbal memory
      abilities in multi-domain amnestic MCI. Participants across groups indicated that
      they perceived the prompting technology to be very helpful.

TI  - Adaptive Dynamic Programming-Based Multi-Sensor Scheduling for Collaborative
      Target Tracking in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks.
LID - 4090
AB  - Collaborative target tracking is one of the most important applications of
      wireless sensor networks (WSNs), in which the network must rely on sensor
      scheduling to balance the tracking accuracy and energy consumption, due to the
      limited network resources for sensing, communication, and computation. With the
      recent development of energy acquisition technologies, the building of WSNs based
      on energy harvesting has become possible to overcome the limitation of battery
      energy in WSNs, where theoretically the lifetime of the network could be extended
      to infinite. However, energy-harvesting WSNs pose new technical challenges for
      collaborative target tracking on how to schedule sensors over the infinite
      horizon under the restriction on limited sensor energy harvesting capabilities.
      In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)-based
      multi-sensor scheduling algorithm (ADP-MSS) for collaborative target tracking for
      energy-harvesting WSNs. ADP-MSS can schedule multiple sensors for each time step 
      over an infinite horizon to achieve high tracking accuracy, based on the extended
      Kalman filter (EKF) for target state prediction and estimation. Theoretical
      analysis shows the optimality of ADP-MSS, and simulation results demonstrate its 
      superior tracking accuracy compared with an ADP-based single-sensor scheduling
      scheme and a simulated-annealing based multi-sensor scheduling scheme.

TI  - Pilot testing a digital pet avatar for older adults.
PG  - 542-7
AB  - Social isolation in older adults is a major public health concern. An embodied
      conversational agent (ECA) has the potential to enhance older adults’ social
      interaction. However, little is known about older adults’ experience with an ECA.
      In this paper, we conducted a pilot study to examine the perceived acceptance and
      utility of a tablet-based conversational agent in the form of an avatar (termed
      “digital pet”) for older adults. We performed secondary analysis of data
      collected from a study that employed the use of a digital pet in ten older
      adults’ homes for three months. Most of the participants enjoyed the
      companionship, entertainment, reminders, and instant assistance from the digital 
      pet. However, participants identified limited conversational ability and
      technical issues as system challenges. Privacy, dependence, and cost were major
      concerns. Future applications should maximize the agent’s conversational ability 
      and the system’s overall usability. Our results can inform future designs of
      conversational agents for older adults, which need to include older adults as
      system co-designers to maximize usability and acceptance.

TI  - The reduction of disability in community-dwelling frail older people: design of a
      two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 511
AB  - Background: Frailty among older people is related to an increased risk of adverse
      health outcomes such as acute and chronic diseases, disability and mortality.
      Although many intervention studies for frail older people have been reported,
      only a few have shown positive effects regarding disability prevention. This
      article presents the design of a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial on
      the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of a primary care
      intervention that combines the most promising elements of disability prevention
      in community-dwelling frail older people. Methods/design: In this study twelve
      general practitioner practices were randomly allocated to the intervention group 
      (6 practices) or to the control group (6 practices). Three thousand four hundred 
      ninety-eight screening questionnaires including the Groningen Frailty Indicator
      (GFI) were sent out to identify frail older people. Based on their GFI score
      (≥5), 360 participants will be included in the study. The intervention will
      receive an interdisciplinary primary care intervention. After a comprehensive
      assessment by a practice nurse and additional assessments by other professionals,
      if needed, an individual action plan will be defined. The action plan is related 
      to a flexible toolbox of interventions, which will be conducted by an
      interdisciplinary team. Effects of the intervention, both for the frail older
      people and their informal caregivers, will be measured after 6, 12 and 24 months 
      using postal questionnaires and telephone interviews. Data for the process
      evaluation and economic evaluation will be gathered continuously over a 24-month 
      period. Discussion: The proposed study will provide information about the
      usefulness of an interdisciplinary primary care intervention. The postal
      screening procedure was conducted in two cycles between December 2009 and April
      2010 and turned out to be a feasible method. The response rate was 79.7%.
      According to GFI scores 29.3% of the respondents can be considered as frail (GFI 
      ≥ 5). Nearly half of them (48.1%) were willing to participate. The baseline
      measurements started in January 2010. In February 2010 the first older people
      were approached by the practice nurse for a comprehensive assessment. Data on the
      effect, process, and economic evaluation will be available in 2012. Trial

      Participants reported using a wide variety of technology items, particularly in
      their homes. Positive attitudes (i.e., likes) outnumbered negative attitudes
      (i.e., dislikes), suggesting that older adults perceive the benefits of
      technology use to outweigh the costs of such use. Positive attitudes were most
      frequently related to how the technology supported activities, enhanced
      convenience, and contained useful features. Negative attitudes were most
      frequently associated with technology creating inconveniences, unhelpful
      features, as well as security and reliability concerns. Given that older adults
      reported more positive than negative attitudes about the technologies they use,
      these results contradict stereotypes that older adults are afraid or unwilling to
      use technology. These findings also highlight the importance of perceived
      benefits of use and ease of use for models of technology acceptance. Emphasizing 
      the benefits of technology in education and training programs may increase future
      technology adoption.

TI  - A Scoping Review of Epidemiological, Ergonomic, and Longitudinal Cohort Studies
      Examining the Links between Stair and Bathroom Falls and the Built Environment.
LID - 1598
AB  - Stair and bathroom falls contribute to injuries among older adults. This review
      examined which features of stairs and bathrooms have been assessed in
      epidemiological, ergonomic, and national aging studies on falls or their risk
      factors. Epidemiological and ergonomic studies were eligible if published from
      2006–2017, written in English, included older persons, and reported built
      environment measures. The data extracted included the following: study population
      and design, outcome measures, and stair and bathroom features. National aging
      studies were eligible if English questionnaires were available, and if data were 
      collected within the last 10 years. Sample characteristics; data collection
      methods; and data about falls, the environment, and assistive device use were
      extracted. There were 114 eligible articles assessed—38 epidemiologic and 76
      ergonomic. Among epidemiological studies, 2 assessed stair falls only, 4 assessed
      bathroom falls only, and 32 assessed falls in both locations. Among ergonomic
      studies, 67 simulated stairs and 9 simulated bathrooms. Specific environmental
      features were described in 14 (36.8%) epidemiological studies and 73 (96%)
      ergonomic studies. Thirteen national aging studies were identified—four had stair
      data and six had bathroom data. Most epidemiologic and national aging studies did
      not include specific measures of stairs or bathrooms; the built environment
      descriptions in ergonomic studies were more detailed. More consistent and
      detailed environmental measures in epidemiologic and national aging studies would
      better inform fall prevention approaches targeting the built environment.

TI  - Perspectives of older people about contingency planning for falls in the
      community: A qualitative meta-synthesis.
LID - e0177510
AB  - Objective: Despite consistent evidence for the positive impact of contingency
      planning for falls in older people, implementation of plans often fail. This is
      likely due to lack of recognition and knowledge about perspectives of older
      people about contingency planning. The objective of this research was to explore 
      the perspectives of older people living in the community about use of contingency
      planning for getting help quickly after a fall. Method: A systematic literature
      search seeking qualitative research was conducted in April 2014, with no limit
      placed on date of publication. Medline, EMBASE, Ageline, CINAHL, HealthSource-
      Nursing/Academic Edition, AMED and Psych INFO databases were searched. Three main
      concepts were explored and linked using Boolean operators; older people, falls
      and contingency planning. The search was updated until February 2016 with no new 
      articles found. After removal of duplicates, 562 articles were assessed against
      inclusion and exclusion criteria resulting in six studies for the meta-synthesis.
      These studies were critically appraised using the McMaster critical appraisal
      tool. Bespoke data extraction sheets were developed and a meta-synthesis approach
      was adopted to extract and synthesise findings. Findings: Three themes of ‘a mix 
      of attitudes’, ‘careful deliberations’ and ‘a source of anxiety’ were
      established. Perspectives of older people were on a continuum between regarding
      contingency plans as necessary and not necessary. Levels of engagement with the
      contingency planning process seemed associated with acceptance of their risk of
      falling and their familiarity with available contingency planning strategies.
      Conclusion: Avoiding a long lie on the floor following a fall is imperative for
      older people in the community but there is a lack of knowledge about contingency 
      planning for falls. This meta-synthesis provides new insights into this area of
      health service delivery and highlights that implementation of plans needs to be
      directed by the older people rather than the health professionals.

TI  - Automatic classifier based on heart rate variability to identify fallers among
      hypertensive subjects.
PG  - 89-94
AB  - Accidental falls are a major problem of later life. Different technologies to
      predict falls have been investigated, but with limited success, mainly because of
      low specificity due to a high false positive rate. This Letter presents an
      automatic classifier based on heart rate variability (HRV) analysis with the goal
      to identify fallers automatically. HRV was used in this study as it is considered
      a good estimator of autonomic nervous system (ANS) states, which are responsible,
      among other things, for human balance control. Nominal 24 h electrocardiogram
      recordings from 168 cardiac patients (age 72 ± 8 years, 60 female), of which 47
      were fallers, were investigated. Linear and nonlinear HRV properties were
      analysed in 30 min excerpts. Different data mining approaches were adopted and
      their performances were compared with a subject-based receiver operating
      characteristic analysis. The best performance was achieved by a hybrid algorithm,
      RUSBoost, integrated with feature selection method based on principal component
      analysis, which achieved satisfactory specificity and accuracy (80 and 72%,
      respectively), but low sensitivity (51%). These results suggested that ANS states
      causing falls could be reliably detected, but also that not all the falls were
      due to ANS states.

TI  - An Analysis of a Digital Variant of the Trail Making Test Using Machine Learning 
      Techniques.
PG  - 251-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this work is to develop a digital version of a standard
      cognitive assessment, the Trail Making Test (TMT), and assess its utility.
      OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a novel digital version of the TMT and
      introduces a machine learning based approach to assess its capabilities. METHODS:
      Using digital Trail Making Test (dTMT) data collected from (N=54) older adult
      participants as feature sets, we use machine learning techniques to analyze the
      utility of the dTMT and evaluate the insights provided by the digital features.
      RESULTS: Predicted TMT scores correlate well with clinical digital test scores
      (r=0.98) and paper time to completion scores (r=0.65). Predicted TICS exhibited a
      small correlation with clinically-derived TICS scores (r=0.12 Part A, r=0.10 Part
      B). Predicted FAB scores exhibited a small correlation with clinically-derived
      FAB scores (r=0.13 Part A, r=0.29 for Part B). Digitally-derived features were
      also used to predict diagnosis (AUC of 0.65). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate
      that the dTMT is capable of measuring the same aspects of cognition as the
      paper-based TMT. Furthermore, the dTMT’s additional data may be able to help
      monitor other cognitive processes not captured by the paper-based TMT alone.

TI  - Use of nonintrusive sensor-based information and communication technology for
      real-world evidence for clinical trials in dementia.
PG  - 1216-31
AB  - Cognitive function is an important end point of treatments in dementia clinical
      trials. Measuring cognitive function by standardized tests, however, is biased
      toward highly constrained environments (such as hospitals) in selected samples.
      Patient-powered real-world evidence using information and communication
      technology devices, including environmental and wearable sensors, may help to
      overcome these limitations. This position paper describes current and novel
      information and communication technology devices and algorithms to monitor
      behavior and function in people with prodromal and manifest stages of dementia
      continuously, and discusses clinical, technological, ethical, regulatory, and
      user-centered requirements for collecting real-world evidence in future
      randomized controlled trials. Challenges of data safety, quality, and privacy and
      regulatory requirements need to be addressed by future smart sensor technologies.
      When these requirements are satisfied, these technologies will provide access to 
      truly user relevant outcomes and broader cohorts of participants than currently
      sampled in clinical trials.

TI  - Air Quality Monitoring for Vulnerable Groups in Residential Environments Using a 
      Multiple Hazard Gas Detector.
LID - 362
AB  - This paper presents a smart “e-nose” device to monitor indoor hazardous air.
      Indoor hazardous odor is a threat for seniors, infants, children, pregnant women,
      disabled residents, and patients. To overcome the limitations of using existing
      non-intelligent, slow-responding, deficient gas sensors, we propose a novel
      artificial-intelligent-based multiple hazard gas detector (MHGD) system that is
      mounted on a motor vehicle-based robot which can be remotely controlled. First,
      we optimized the sensor array for the classification of three hazardous gases,
      including cigarette smoke, inflammable ethanol, and off-flavor from spoiled food,
      using an e-nose with a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber can prevent the impact 
      of environmental changes. We compared the classification results of all
      combinations of sensors, and selected the one with the highest accuracy (98.88%) 
      as the optimal sensor array for the MHGD. The optimal sensor array was then
      mounted on the MHGD to detect and classify the target gases without a mixing
      chamber but in a controlled environment. Finally, we tested the MHGD under these 
      conditions, and achieved an acceptable accuracy (70.00%).

TI  - A Novel Sensor-Assisted RFID-Based Indoor Tracking System for the Elderly Living 
      Alone.
PG  - 10094-113
AB  - The population of elderly people is increasing rapidly in many developed nations.
      Providing safe and comfortable care to aging people is an important social goal. 
      Moreover, obtaining correct activity and location information for an elderly
      person is an important research goal. This work proposes a novel intelligent
      RFID-based indoor tracking system for elderly people living alone. The proposed
      system uses environment information for inhabitants and received signal strength 
      of an RFID reader to estimate the probable location of an inhabitant. The
      proposed system then coordinates with the wireless sensor node of a three-axis
      accelerometer and uses a genetic algorithm to compute the location of the
      inhabitant. The proposed system also uses context and gait information to improve
      inhabitant-tracking accuracy. Experiment results show that the accuracy of the
      proposed system is better than that of existing RFID-based systems.

TI  - A ZigBee-Based Location-Aware Fall Detection System for Improving Elderly
      Telecare.
PG  - 4233-48
AB  - Falls are the primary cause of accidents among the elderly and frequently cause
      fatal and non-fatal injuries associated with a large amount of medical costs.
      Fall detection using wearable wireless sensor nodes has the potential of
      improving elderly telecare. This investigation proposes a ZigBee-based
      location-aware fall detection system for elderly telecare that provides an
      unobstructed communication between the elderly and caregivers when falls happen. 
      The system is based on ZigBee-based sensor networks, and the sensor node consists
      of a motherboard with a tri-axial accelerometer and a ZigBee module. A wireless
      sensor node worn on the waist continuously detects fall events and starts an
      indoor positioning engine as soon as a fall happens. In the fall detection
      scheme, this study proposes a three-phase threshold-based fall detection
      algorithm to detect critical and normal falls. The fall alarm can be canceled by 
      pressing and holding the emergency fall button only when a normal fall is
      detected. On the other hand, there are three phases in the indoor positioning
      engine: path loss survey phase, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
      collection phase and location calculation phase. Finally, the location of the
      faller will be calculated by a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with weighted RSSI.
      The experimental results demonstrate that the fall detection algorithm achieves
      95.63% sensitivity, 73.5% specificity, 88.62% accuracy and 88.6% precision.
      Furthermore, the average error distance for indoor positioning is 1.15 ± 0.54 m. 
      The proposed system successfully delivers critical information to remote telecare
      providers who can then immediately help a fallen person.

PG  - 283-94
AB  - This chapter focuses on rehabilitation robotics which can be used to augment the 
      clinician’s toolbox in order to deliver meaningful restorative therapy for an
      aging population, as well as on advances in orthotics to augment an individual’s 
      functional abilities beyond neurorestoration potential. The interest in
      rehabilitation robotics and orthotics is increasing steadily with marked growth
      in the last 10 years. This growth is understandable in view of the increased
      demand for caregivers and rehabilitation services escalating apace with the
      graying of the population. We will provide an overview on improving function in
      people with a weak limb due to a neurological disorder who cannot properly
      control it to interact with the environment (orthotics); we will then focus on
      tools to assist the clinician in promoting rehabilitation of an individual so
      that s/he can interact with the environment unassisted (rehabilitation robotics).
      We will present a few clinical results occurring immediately poststroke as well
      as during the chronic phase that demonstrate superior gains for the upper
      extremity when employing rehabilitation robotics instead of usual care. These
      include the landmark VA-ROBOTICS multisite, randomized clinical study which
      demonstrates clinical gains for chronic stroke that go beyond usual care at no
      additional cost.

PG  - 5561-95
AB  - Wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies are considered one of the key research
      areas in computer science and the healthcare application industries for improving
      the quality of life. The purpose of this paper is to provide a snapshot of
      current developments and future direction of research on wearable and implantable
      body area network systems for continuous monitoring of patients. This paper
      explains the important role of body sensor networks in medicine to minimize the
      need for caregivers and help the chronically ill and elderly people live an
      independent life, besides providing people with quality care. The paper provides 
      several examples of state of the art technology together with the design
      considerations like unobtrusiveness, scalability, energy efficiency, security and
      also provides a comprehensive analysis of the various benefits and drawbacks of
      these systems. Although offering significant benefits, the field of wearable and 
      implantable body sensor networks still faces major challenges and open research
      problems which are investigated and covered, along with some proposed solutions, 
      in this paper.

TI  - “Are you sure?”: Lapses in Self-Reported Activities Among Healthy Older Adults
      Reporting Online.
PG  - 627-41
AB  - Accurate retrospective reporting of activities and symptoms has been shown to be 
      problematic for older adults, yet standard clinical care relies on self-reports
      to aid in assessment and management. Our aim was to examine the relationship
      between self-report and sensor-based measures of activity. We administered an
      online activity survey to participants in our ongoing longitudinal study of
      in-home ubiquitous monitoring. We found a wide range of accuracy when comparing
      self-report with time-stamped sensor data. Of the 95 participants who completed
      the two-hour activity log, nearly one quarter did not complete the task in a way 
      that could potentially be compared with sensor data. Where comparisons were
      possible, agreement between self-reported and sensor-based activity was achieved 
      by a minority of participants. The findings suggest that capture of real time
      events with unobtrusive activity monitoring may be a more reliable approach to
      describing behaviors patterns and meaningful changes in older adults.

      Integration Lessons Learned.
PG  - 329-34
AB  - Health monitoring data collected from multiple available intake devices provide a
      rich resource to support older adult health and wellness. Though large amounts of
      data can be collected, there is currently a lack of understanding on integration 
      of these various data sources using commercially available products. This article
      describes an inexpensive approach to integrating data from multiple sources from 
      a recently completed pilot project that assessed older adult wellness, and
      demonstrates challenges and benefits in pursuing data integration using
      commercially available products. The data in this project were sourced from a)
      electronically captured participant intake surveys, and existing commercial
      software output for b) vital signs and c) cognitive function. All the software
      used for data integration in this project was freeware and was chosen because of 
      its ease of comprehension by novice database users. The methods and results of
      this approach provide a model for researchers with similar data integration needs
      to easily replicate this effort at a low cost.

TI  - Principle of rational prescribing and deprescribing in older adults with multiple
      chronic conditions.
PG  - 639-52
AB  - Although the majority of older adults in the developed world live with multiple
      chronic conditions (MCCs), the task of selecting optimal treatment regimens is
      still fraught with difficulty. Older adults with MCCs may derive less benefit
      from prescribed medications than healthier patients as a result of the competing 
      risk of several possible outcomes including, but not limited to, death before a
      benefit can be accrued. In addition, these patients may be at increased risk of
      medication-related harms in the form of adverse effects and significant burdens
      of treatment. At present, the balance of these benefits and harms is often
      uncertain, given that older adults with MCCs are often excluded from clinical
      trials. In this review, we propose a framework to consider patients’ own
      priorities to achieve optimal treatment regimens. To begin, the practicing
      clinician needs information on the patient’s goals, what the patient is willing
      and able to do to achieve these goals, an estimate of the patient’s clinical
      trajectory, and what the patient is actually taking. We then describe how to
      integrate this information to understand what matters most to the patient in the 
      context of an array of potential tradeoffs. Finally, we propose conducting serial
      therapeutic trials of prescribing and deprescribing, with success measured as
      progress towards the patient’s own health outcome goals. The process described in
      this manuscript is truly an iterative process, which should be repeated regularly
      to account for changes in the patient’s priorities and clinical status. With this
      process, we aim to achieve optimal prescribing, that is, treatment regimens that 
      maximize benefits that matter to the patient and minimize burdens and potential
      harms.

TI  - Applications of Technology in Neuropsychological Assessment.
LID - 10.1080/13854046.2013.834971
AB  - Most neuropsychological assessments include at least one measure that is
      administered, scored, or interpreted by computers or other technologies. Despite 
      supportive findings for these technology-based assessments, there is resistance
      in the field of neuropsychology to adopt additional measures that incorporate
      technology components. This literature review addresses the research findings of 
      technology-based neuropsychological assessments, including computer-, and virtual
      reality-based measures of cognitive and functional abilities. We evaluate the
      strengths and limitations of each approach, and examine the utility of
      technology-based assessments to obtain supplemental cognitive and behavioral
      information that may be otherwise undetected by traditional paper and pencil
      measures. We argue that the potential of technology use in neuropsychological
      assessment has not yet been realized, and continued adoption of new technologies 
      could result in more comprehensive assessment of cognitive dysfunction and in
      turn, better informed diagnosis and treatments. Recommendations for future
      research are also provided.

TI  - Bridging the digital divide in older adults: a study from an initiative to inform
      older adults about new technologies.
PG  - 193-201
AB  - Purpose: In a society where technology progresses at an exponential rate, older
      adults are often unaware of the existence of different kinds of information and
      communication technologies (ICTs). To bridge the gap, we launched a 2-year
      project, during which we conducted focus groups (FGs) with demonstrations of
      ICTs, allowing older adults to try them out and to share their opinions. This
      study aimed at investigating how participants perceived this kind of initiative
      and how they reacted to different kinds of ICTs. Patients and methods: In total, 
      14 FGs were conducted with community-dwelling older adults, with a frequency of
      two FGs on the same topic once per trimester. Twenty-three older adults (four men
      and 19 women) attended at least one FG but only nearly half of them were regular 
      attendants (ten participating in at least five sessions). Age of participants
      ranged from 63 years to 88 years, with a mean of 77.1 years. All of them had
      completed secondary education. The analyses of the data were performed according 
      to inductive thematic analysis. Results: Four overarching themes emerged from the
      analysis. The first concerned participants’ motivation for and assessment of the 
      project. The second theme identified the underlying factors of the “digital
      divide” between the younger and the older generations. The third theme concerned 
      the factors of technology adoption among older adults. The fourth one identified 
      participants’ attitudes toward assistive ICTs, designed specifically for older
      adults (“gerontechnologies”). Discussions and conclusion: This project
      encouraging older adults to be informed about different kinds of ICTs was
      positively rated. With regard to ICTs, participants perceived a digital divide.
      The underlying factors are generation/cohort effects, cognitive and physical
      decline related to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies. However,
      more and more older adults adopt different kinds of ICTs in order to fit in with 
      the society. Concerning assistive ICTs, they manifested a lack of perceived need 
      and usefulness. Also, there was a negative image of end users of this kind of
      technologies. The so-called gerontechnologies specifically targeting older adults
      contain stigmatizing symbolism that might prevent them from adopting them.

PG  - 238-44
AB  - The research provides results of an expert review of data displays for a sensor
      system used to monitor functional abilities in the elderly. The research took
      place at TigerPlace, an assisted living facility, where the sensor system is
      currently being evaluated. A checklist of 16 heuristic criteria was used to
      evaluate the sensor data displays keeping in mind the users of the system, adults
      and elderly people. Results of our expert review indicate that flexibility and
      efficiency of use, help and documentation, navigation and skills were not well
      developed in our sensor data displays. Conversely, sensor data displays were
      rated highly for their aesthetic value and for their ample visual contrast for
      the main parts of the data displays. Researchers believe that through the use of 
      a sensor system we can accomplish new ways of detecting functional decline in
      elderly residents living in assisted living facilities.

      Evidence-Based Decision Making: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 541-58
AB  - Background: Healthcare is a knowledge driven process and thus knowledge
      management and the tools to manage knowledge in healthcare sector are gaining
      attention. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate knowledge
      management implementation and knowledge management tools used in healthcare for
      informed decision making. Methods: Three databases, two journals websites and
      Google Scholar were used as sources for the review. The key terms used to search 
      relevant articles include: “Healthcare and Knowledge Management”; “Knowledge
      Management Tools in Healthcare” and “Community of Practices in healthcare”.
      Results: It was found that utilization of knowledge management in healthcare is
      encouraging. There exist numbers of opportunities for knowledge management
      implementation, though there are some barriers as well. Some of the opportunities
      that can transform healthcare are advances in health information and
      communication technology, clinical decision support systems, electronic health
      record systems, communities of practice and advanced care planning. Conclusion:
      Providing the right knowledge at the right time, i.e., at the point of decision
      making by implementing knowledge management in healthcare is paramount. To do so,
      it is very important to use appropriate tools for knowledge management and
      user-friendly system because it can significantly improve the quality and safety 
      of care provided for patients both at hospital and home settings.

TI  - Generating Sensor Data Summaries to Communicate Change in Elder’s Health Status.
PG  - 73-84
AB  - Background: Sensor systems detect critical health changes of frail residents in
      the community. However, sensor systems alone may not allow users to identify data
      trends fast enough. Linguistic summaries of sensor data describing elder activity
      in their apartment provide a useful solution so clinicians can respond quicker.
      Objectives: This paper describes two case studies of independent elders living
      with sensors in their assisted living apartment. Residents experienced declining 
      health status and activity level over a period of approximately 24 months.
      Linguistic summaries were assessed iteratively by engineers and nurses working
      with the sensor system. Methods: We created summaries of activity data collected 
      from sensors located in resident apartments during a period of health status
      change. Engineers distilled information from heterogeneous data sources including
      bedroom motion and bed restlessness sensors during the summarization process.
      Engineers used fuzzy measures to compare two different periods of nighttime
      activity. Using iterative approaches a registered nurse worked with the team to
      develop algorithms and short phrases that appropriately capture and describe
      changes in activity levels. Results: Total activity levels captured by sensors
      were graphed for two elderly residents experiencing health problems over a period
      of months. In the first case study (resident 3004), an elderly resident had knee 
      surgery and onset of backspasms postoperatively. Graphed dissimilar measures show
      changes from baseline when backspasms occur. In the second case study (resident
      3003), there were increased periods of bed restlessness before and after a
      resident had a major surgical procedure. During these periods, graphs of
      dissimilarity measures indicate that there were changes from usual baseline
      periods of restlessness postoperatively indicating the health problems were
      persisting. Nurse care coordination notes indicate these episodes were related to
      poor pain control. Conclusions: Summaries of activity change are useful for care 
      coordinators to detect resident health status for community dwelling residents.

TI  - Assessment of Smart Watches for Management of Non-Communicable Diseases in the
      Ageing Population: A Systematic Review.
LID - 56
AB  - Advancement in wearable technologies is providing promising new ways to monitor
      and improve patient care to the ageing population. With the global demographic
      transition of developed countries to an ageing population, implementation of
      these technologies could benefit patients and clinicians. This systematic review 
      assesses experimental studies performed utilizing these technologies. A
      systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was performed on the application of
      wearable technologies in the patients 60 years old or greater or what is
      considered ageing population. Search results were reviewed and synthesized to
      attempt to ascertain its possible clinical application and impact. A total of 422
      papers were identified for review. Eight papers were relevant to the ageing
      population. The majority of papers identified were experimental studies. This was
      because the technology is still new to the field of medicine. The studies were
      performed in North America, United Kingdom, Germany and Indonesia. All showed
      promise that wearable technologies can benefit the management of non-communicable
      diseases in the ageing population. Current studies focus on the experimental
      nature of wearable technology. Further clinical trials are needed to assess the
      benefit in the management of ageing populations in the clinical setting.

TI  - Technological Health Intervention in Population Aging to Assist People to Work
      Smarter not Harder: Qualitative Study.
LID - e3
AB  - Background: Technology-based health care has been promoted as an effective tool
      to enable clinicians to work smarter. However, some health stakeholders believe
      technology will compel users to work harder by creating extra work. Objective:
      The objective of this study was to investigate how and why electronic health
      (eHealth) has been applied in Taiwan and to suggest implications that may inspire
      other countries facing similar challenges. Methods: A qualitative methodology was
      adopted to obtain insightful inputs from deeper probing. Taiwan was selected as a
      typical case study, given its aging population, advanced technology, and
      comprehensive health care system. This study investigated 38 stakeholders in the 
      health care ecosystem through in-depth interviews and focus groups, which
      provides an open, flexible, and enlightening way to study complex, dynamic, and
      interactive situations through informal conversation or a more structured,
      directed discussion. Results: First, respondents indicated that the use of
      technology can enable seamless patient care and clinical benefits such as
      flexibility in time management. Second, the results suggested that a leader’s
      vision, authority, and management skills might influence success in health care
      innovation. Finally, the results implied that both internal and external
      organizational governance are highly relevant for implementing technology-based
      innovation in health care. Conclusions: This study provided Taiwanese
      perspectives on how to intelligently use technology to benefit health care and
      debated the perception that technology prevents human interaction between
      clinicians and patients.

TI  - Making Sense of Mobile- and Web-Based Wellness Information Technology:
      Cross-Generational Study.
LID - e83
AB  - Background: A recent trend in personal health and wellness management is the
      development of computerized applications or information and communication
      technologies (ICTs) that support behavioral change, aid the management of chronic
      conditions, or help an individual manage their wellness and engage in a healthier
      lifestyle. Objective: To understand how individuals across 3 generations (young, 
      middle-aged, and older) think about the design and use of collaborative health
      and wellness management technologies and what roles these could take in their
      lives. Methods: Face-to-face semistructured interviews, paper prototype systems, 
      and video skits were used to assess how individuals from 3 age cohorts (young:
      18-25 years; middle-aged: 35-50 years; and older: ≥65 years) conceptualize the
      role that health and wellness computing could take in their lives. Results: A
      total of 21 participants in the 3 age cohorts took part (young: n=7; middle-aged:
      n=7; and older: n=7). Young adults expected to be able to actively manage the
      presentation of their health-related information. Middle-aged adults had more
      nuanced expectations that reflect their engagement with work and other life
      activities. Older adults questioned the sharing of health information with a
      larger audience, although they saw the value in 1-way sharing between family
      members or providing aggregated information. Conclusions: Our findings inform our
      suggestions for improving the design of future collaborative health and wellness 
      applications that target specific age groups. We recommend that collaborative ICT
      health applications targeting young adults should integrate with existing social 
      networking sites, whereas those targeting middle-aged and older adults should
      support small social networks that rely on intimate personal relationships.
      Systems that target middle-aged adults should support episodic needs, such as
      time-sensitive, perhaps intermittent, goal setting. They should also have a low
      barrier to entry, allowing individuals who do not normally engage with the
      Internet to participate with the application for the specific purposes of health 
      engagement. Collaborative ICT health applications targeting older adults should
      allow discreet 1-way sharing, and also support sharing of information in
      aggregate with others’ data. These systems should also provide mechanisms to
      preselect recipients of different kinds of data, or to easily direct specific
      information to individuals in real time.

TI  - What Does Big Data Mean for Wearable Sensor Systems?: Contribution of the IMIA
      Wearable Sensors in Healthcare WG.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this paper is to discuss how recent developments in the
      field of big data may potentially impact the future use of wearable sensor
      systems in healthcare. Methods: The article draws on the scientific literature to
      support the opinions presented by the IMIA Wearable Sensors in Healthcare Working
      Group. Results: The following is discussed: the potential for wearable sensors to
      generate big data; how complementary technologies, such as a smartphone, will
      augment the concept of a wearable sensor and alter the nature of the monitoring
      data created; how standards would enable sharing of data and advance scientific
      progress. Importantly, attention is drawn to statistical inference problems for
      which big datasets provide little assistance, or may hinder the identification of
      a useful solution. Finally, a discussion is presented on risks to privacy and
      possible negative consequences arising from intensive wearable sensor monitoring.
      Conclusions: Wearable sensors systems have the potential to generate datasets
      which are currently beyond our capabilities to easily organize and interpret. In 
      order to successfully utilize wearable sensor data to infer wellbeing, and enable
      proactive health management, standards and ontologies must be developed which
      allow for data to be shared between research groups and between commercial
      systems, promoting the integration of these data into health information systems.
      However, policy and regulation will be required to ensure that the detailed
      nature of wearable sensor data is not misused to invade privacies or prejudice
      against individuals.

TI  - A Review of Refractometric Sensors Based on Long Period Fibre Gratings.
LID - 913418
AB  - In the last decade refractometric sensors have attracted an increasing interest
      by the scientific community due to their ability to perform ambient monitoring,
      to assess food quality and safety, and also to the fact that they enable the
      development of label free sensors in the biomedical area. These advances result, 
      namely, from the use of long period fibre gratings in the turning points and/or
      with thin films in the transition region that allows resolutions of 10−6 to
      changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Resolutions exceeding 
      10−8 can also be achieved when long period fibre gratings are combined with
      evanescent field based devices. This paper reviews the recent path towards the
      development of ultrahigh sensitive optical fibre refractometric sensors.

TI  - The Need for a Definition of Big Data for Nursing Science: A Case Study of
      Disaster Preparedness.
LID - 1015
AB  - The rapid development of technology has made enormous volumes of data available
      and achievable anytime and anywhere around the world. Data scientists call this
      change a data era and have introduced the term “Big Data”, which has drawn the
      attention of nursing scholars. Nevertheless, the concept of Big Data is quite
      fuzzy and there is no agreement on its definition among researchers of different 
      disciplines. Without a clear consensus on this issue, nursing scholars who are
      relatively new to the concept may consider Big Data to be merely a dataset of a
      bigger size. Having a suitable definition for nurse researchers in their context 
      of research and practice is essential for the advancement of nursing research. In
      view of the need for a better understanding on what Big Data is, the aim in this 
      paper is to explore and discuss the concept. Furthermore, an example of a Big
      Data research study on disaster nursing preparedness involving six million
      patient records is used for discussion. The example demonstrates that a Big Data 
      analysis can be conducted from many more perspectives than would be possible in
      traditional sampling, and is superior to traditional sampling. Experience gained 
      from the process of using Big Data in this study will shed light on future
      opportunities for conducting evidence-based nursing research to achieve
      competence in disaster nursing.

TI  - A Mobile/Web App for Long Distance Caregivers of Older Adults: Functional
      Requirements and Design Implications from a User Centered Design Process.
PG  - 1960-9
AB  - Recent trends of population aging and globalization have required an increasing
      number of individuals to act as long distance caregivers (LDCs) to aging family
      members. Information technology solutions may ease the burden placed on LDCs by
      providing remote monitoring, easier access to information and enhanced
      communication. While some technology tools have been introduced, the information 
      and technology needs of LDCs in particular are not well understood. Consequently,
      a needs assessment was performed by using video conferencing software to conduct 
      semi-structured interviews with 10 LDCs. Interviews were enriched through the use
      of stimulus materials that included the demonstration of a prototype LDC health
      management web/mobile app. Responses were recorded, transcribed and then
      analyzed. Subjects indicated that information regarding medication regimens and
      adherence, calendaring, and cognitive health were most needed. Participants also 
      described needs for video calling, activity data regarding sleep and physical
      exercise, asynchronous communication, photo sharing, journaling, access to online
      health resources, real-time monitoring, an overall summary of health, and
      feedback/suggestions to help them improve as caregivers. In addition, all
      respondents estimated their usage of a LDC health management website would be at 
      least once per week, with half indicating a desire to access the website from a
      smartphone. These findings are being used to inform the design of a LDC health
      management website to promote the meaningful involvement of distant family
      members in the care of older adults.

LID - 509198
AB  - This study investigates the anticipated psychosocial impact of present web-based 
      e-health services and future mobile health applications among older Swedes.
      Random sample's of Swedish citizens aged 55 years old and older were given a
      survey containing two different e-health scenarios which respondents rated
      according to their anticipated psychosocial impact by means of the PIADS
      instrument. Results consistently demonstrated the positive anticipation of
      psychosocial impacts for both scenarios. The future mobile health applications
      scored more positively than the present web-based e-health services. An increase 
      in age correlated positively to lower impact scores. These findings indicate that
      from a psychosocial perspective, web-based e-health services and mobile health
      applications are likely to positively impact quality of life. This knowledge can 
      be helpful when tailoring and implementing e-health services that are directed to
      older people.

TI  - Classification of Healthy Subjects and Alzheimer's Disease Patients with Dementia
      from Cortical Sources of Resting State EEG Rhythms: A Study Using Artificial
      Neural Networks.
LID - 604
AB  - Previous evidence showed a 75.5% best accuracy in the classification of 120
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with dementia and 100 matched normal elderly
      (Nold) subjects based on cortical source current density and linear lagged
      connectivity estimated by eLORETA freeware from resting state eyes-closed
      electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms (Babiloni et al., 2016a). Specifically,
      that accuracy was reached using the ratio between occipital delta and alpha1
      current density for a linear univariate classifier (receiver operating
      characteristic curves). Here we tested an innovative approach based on an
      artificial neural network (ANN) classifier from the same database of rsEEG
      markers. Frequency bands of interest were delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz Hz),
      alpha1 (8–10.5 Hz), and alpha2 (10.5–13 Hz). ANN classification showed an
      accuracy of 77% using the most 4 discriminative rsEEG markers of source current
      density (parietal theta/alpha 1, temporal theta/alpha 1, occipital theta/alpha 1,
      and occipital delta/alpha 1). It also showed an accuracy of 72% using the most 4 
      discriminative rsEEG markers of source lagged linear connectivity
      (inter-hemispherical occipital delta/alpha 2, intra-hemispherical right
      parietal-limbic alpha 1, intra-hemispherical left occipital-temporal theta/alpha 
      1, intra-hemispherical right occipital-temporal theta/alpha 1). With these 8
      markers combined, an accuracy of at least 76% was reached. Interestingly, this
      accuracy based on 8 (linear) rsEEG markers as inputs to ANN was similar to that
      obtained with a single rsEEG marker (Babiloni et al., 2016a), thus unveiling
      their information redundancy for classification purposes. In future AD studies,
      inputs to ANNs should include other classes of independent linear (i.e., directed
      transfer function) and non-linear (i.e., entropy) rsEEG markers to improve the
      classification.

TI  - Towards a Passive Low-Cost In-Home Gait Assessment System for Older Adults.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2012.2233745
AB  - In this paper, we propose a webcam-based system for in-home gait assessment of
      older adults. A methodology has been developed to extract gait parameters
      including walking speed, step time and step length from a three-dimensional voxel
      reconstruction, which is built from two calibrated webcam views. The gait
      parameters are validated with a GAITRite mat and a Vicon motion capture system in
      the lab with 13 participants and 44 tests, and again with GAITRite for 8 older
      adults in senior housing. An excellent agreement with intra-class correlation
      coefficients of 0.99 and repeatability coefficients between 0.7% and 6.6% was
      found for walking speed, step time and step length given the limitation of frame 
      rate and voxel resolution. The system was further tested with 10 seniors in a
      scripted scenario representing everyday activities in an unstructured
      environment. The system results demonstrate the capability of being used as a
      daily gait assessment tool for fall risk assessment and other medical
      applications. Furthermore, we found that residents displayed different gait
      patterns during their clinical GAITRite tests compared to the realistic scenario,
      namely a mean increase of 21% in walking speed, a mean decrease of 12% in step
      time, and a mean increase of 6% in step length. These findings provide support
      for continuous gait assessment in the home for capturing habitual gait.

TI  - Development of an open technology sensor suite for assisted living: a student-led
      research project.
LID - 20160018
AB  - Many countries have a rapidly ageing population, placing strain on health
      services and creating a growing market for assistive technology for older people.
      We have, through a student-led, 12-week project for 10 students from a variety of
      science and engineering backgrounds, developed an integrated sensor system to
      enable older people, or those at risk, to live independently in their own homes
      for longer, while providing reassurance for their family and carers. We provide
      details on the design procedure and performance of our sensor system and the
      management and execution of a short-term, student-led research project. Detailed 
      information on the design and use of our devices, including a door sensor, power 
      monitor, fall detector, general in-house sensor unit and easy-to-use
      location-aware communications device, is given, with our open designs being
      contrasted with closed proprietary systems. A case study is presented for the use
      of our devices in a real-world context, along with a comparison with commercially
      available systems. We discuss how the system could lead to improvements in the
      quality of life of older users and increase the effectiveness of their associated
      care network. We reflect on how recent developments in open source technology and
      rapid prototyping increase the scope and potential for the development of
      powerful sensor systems and, finally, conclude with a student perspective on this
      team effort and highlight learning outcomes, arguing that open technologies will 
      revolutionize the way in which technology will be deployed in academic research
      in the future.

TI  - The Impact of Built Environment on Diabetic Patients: The Case of Eastern
      Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 126-38
AB  - At present, Diabetes mellitus is considered as one of the main threats to the
      human health in the 21st century. It may lead to severe conditions such as
      blindness, end-stage of renal disease, limb amputation and a variety of
      debilitating neuropathies. Previous researches indicated that diabetes is caused 
      by a complex interaction of patient’s genetics, life-style and environmental
      factors. They also highlighted that providing quality and healthy built
      environment to citizens including diabetic patients would prevent poor and
      unhealthy condition. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is one of top ten
      countries in the prevalence of diabetes. Little researches though were conducted 
      in KSA in regards to the effect of environmental conditions of the built
      environment. In 2011, the present researchers have carried out a pilot survey on 
      a number of diabetic patients to find out the possible impact of built
      environment settings on the patient’s lifestyle. The research explored whether
      diabetic patients use smart tools in their daily life to overcome the daily
      life’s difficulties and perform their life as normal as possible. The results
      showed a close link between a poor home and environmental settings, the patient’s
      lifestyle, and the patient’s health status. It also highlighted the absence of
      smart tools and systems use. The paper argues that certain changes to the built
      environment must be done and to provide a healthy and safe environment for
      diabetic patients. This would help these patients to abandon their bad habits and
      adopt healthier lifestyle.

TI  - Modeling the Oldest Old: Personas to Design Technology-Based Solutions for Older 
      Adults.
PG  - 1166-75
AB  - There is a recognized need to develop information technology for the delivery of 
      care services to older adults. However, little attention has been paid to the
      design of information technology for the oldest old demographic. We made novel
      use of data from observations, focus groups and cluster analysis of oldest old
      participant characteristics from a pilot study in a community setting to
      iteratively construct personas for the design of information technology for the
      oldest old. The resulting two personas, “Hazel” and “Rose”, capture different
      abilities of members of the oldest old demographic group. In addition, we provide
      a list of eleven design recommendations to guide the design of technology that
      supports the abilities of people like Hazel and Rose. The resulting personas,
      design recommendations and persona construction method can be useful tools for
      informaticians and designers of new systems for the oldest old.

TI  - A comprehensive approach to reablement in dementia.
PG  - 450-8
AB  - As society grapples with an aging population and increasing prevalence of
      disability, “reablement” as a means of maximizing functional ability in older
      people is emerging as a potential strategy to help promote independence.
      Reablement offers an approach to mitigate the impact of dementia on function and 
      independence. This article presents a comprehensive reablement approach across
      seven domains for the person living with mild-to-moderate dementia. Domains
      include assessment and medical management, cognitive disability, physical
      function, acute injury or illness, assistive technology, supportive care, and
      caregiver support. In the absence of a cure or ability to significantly modify
      the course of the disease, the message for policy makers, practitioners,
      families, and persons with dementia needs to be “living well with dementia”, with
      a focus on maintaining function for as long as possible, regaining lost function 
      when there is the potential to do so, and adapting to lost function that cannot
      be regained. Service delivery and care of persons with dementia must be
      reoriented such that evidence-based reablement approaches are integrated into
      routine care across all sectors.

TI  - Impact of a Wearable Device-Based Walking Programs in Rural Older Adults on
      Physical Activity and Health Outcomes: Cohort Study.
LID - e11335
AB  - Background: Community-dwelling older adults living in rural areas are in a less
      favorable environment for health care compared with urban older adults. We
      believe that intermittent coaching through wearable devices can help optimize
      health care for older adults in medically limited environments. Objective: We
      aimed to evaluate whether a wearable device and mobile-based intermittent
      coaching or self-management could increase physical activity and health outcomes 
      of small groups of older adults in rural areas. Methods: To address the above
      evaluation goal, we carried out the “Smart Walk” program, a health care model
      wherein a wearable device is used to promote self-exercise particularly among
      community-dwelling older adults managed by a community health center. We randomly
      selected older adults who had enrolled in a population-based, prospective cohort 
      study of aging, the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area. The “Smart Walk”
      program was a 13-month program conducted from March 2017 to March 2018 and
      included 6 months of coaching, 1 month of rest, and 6 months of self-management. 
      We evaluated differences in physical activity and health outcomes according to
      frailty status and conducted pre- and postanalyses of the Smart Walk program. We 
      also performed intergroup analysis according to adherence of wearable devices.
      Results: We recruited 22 participants (11 robust and 11 prefrail older adults).
      The two groups were similar in most of the variables, except for age, frailty
      index, and Short Physical Performance Battery score associated with frailty
      criteria. After a 6-month coaching program, the prefrail group showed significant
      improvement in usual gait speed (mean 0.73 [SD 0.11] vs mean 0.96 [SD 0.27],
      P=.02), International Physical Activity Questionnaire scores in kcal (mean
      2790.36 [SD 2224.62] vs mean 7589.72 [SD 4452.52], P=.01), and European Quality
      of Life-5 Dimensions score (mean 0.84 [SD 0.07] vs mean 0.90 [SD 0.07], P=.02),
      although no significant improvement was found in the robust group. The average
      total step count was significantly different and was approximately four times
      higher in the coaching period than in the self-management period (5,584,295.83 vs
      1,289,084.66, P<.001). We found that participants in the “long-self” group who
      used the wearable device for the longest time showed increased body weight and
      body mass index by mean 0.65 (SD 1.317) and mean 0.097 (SD 0.513), respectively, 
      compared with the other groups. Conclusions: Our “Smart Walk” program improved
      physical fitness, anthropometric measurements, and geriatric assessment
      categories in a small group of older adults in rural areas with limited resources
      for monitoring. Further validation through various rural public health centers
      and in a large number of rural older adults is required.

TI  - Telerehabilitation: State-of-the-Art from an Informatics Perspective.
PG  - 73-84
AB  - Rehabilitation service providers in rural or underserved areas are often
      challenged in meeting the needs of their complex patients due to limited
      resources in their geographical area. Recruitment and retention of the rural
      clinical workforce are beset by the ongoing problems associated with limited
      continuing education opportunities, professional isolation, and the challenges
      inherent to coordinating rural community healthcare. People with disabilities who
      live in rural communities also face challenges accessing healthcare. Traveling
      long distances to a specialty clinic for necessary expertise is troublesome due
      to inadequate or unavailable transportation, disability specific limitations, and
      financial limitations. Distance and lack of access are just two threats to
      quality of care that now being addressed by the use of videoconferencing,
      information exchange, and other telecommunication technologies that facilitate
      telerehabilitation. This white paper illustrates and summarizes clinical and
      vocational applications of telerehabilitation. We provide definitions related to 
      the fields of telemedicine, telehealth, and telerehabilitation, and consider the 
      impetus for telerehabilitation. We review the telerehabilitation literature for
      assistive technology applications, pressure ulcer prevention, virtual reality
      applications, speech-language pathology applications, seating and wheeled
      mobility applications, vocational rehabilitation applications, and
      cost-effectiveness. We then discuss external telerehabilitation influencers, such
      as the positions of professional organizations. Finally, we summarize clinical
      and policy issues in a limited context appropriate to the scope of this paper.

TI  - In-home monitoring of older adults with vision impairment: exploring patients’,
      caregivers’ and professionals’ views.
PG  - 56-63
AB  - Objective: To develop a conceptual framework for the design of an in-home
      monitoring system (IMS) based on the requirements of older adults with vision
      impairment (VI), informal caregivers and eye-care rehabilitation professionals.
      Materials and Methods: Concept mapping, a mixed-methods statistical research
      tool, was used in the construction of the framework. Overall, 40 participants
      brainstormed or sorted and rated 83 statements concerning an IMS for older adults
      with VI. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were employed
      to construct the framework. A questionnaire yielded further insights into the
      views of a wider sample of older adults with VI (n=78) and caregivers (n=25)
      regarding IMS. Results: Concept mapping revealed a nine-cluster model of
      IMS-related aspects including affordability, awareness of system capabilities,
      simplicity of installation, operation and maintenance, system integrity and
      reliability, fall detection and safe movement, user customization, user
      preferences regarding information delivery, and safety alerts for patients and
      caregivers. From the questionnaire, independence, safety and fall detection were 
      the most commonly reported reasons for older adults and caregivers to accept an
      IMS. Concerns included cost, privacy, security of the information obtained
      through monitoring, system accuracy, and ease of use. Discussion: Older adults
      with VI, caregivers and professionals are receptive to in-home monitoring, mainly
      for fall detection and safety monitoring, but have concerns that must be
      addressed when developing an IMS. Conclusion: Our study provides a novel
      conceptual framework for the design of an IMS that will be maximally acceptable
      and beneficial to our ageing and vision-impaired population.

TI  - A Web-Based Non-Intrusive Ambient System to Measure and Classify Activities of
      Daily Living.
LID - e175
AB  - Background: The number of older adults in the global population is increasing.
      This demographic shift leads to an increasing prevalence of age-associated
      disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia. With the
      progression of the disease, the risk for institutional care increases, which
      contrasts with the desire of most patients to stay in their home environment.
      Despite doctors’ and caregivers’ awareness of the patient’s cognitive status,
      they are often uncertain about its consequences on activities of daily living
      (ADL). To provide effective care, they need to know how patients cope with ADL,
      in particular, the estimation of risks associated with the cognitive decline. The
      occurrence, performance, and duration of different ADL are important indicators
      of functional ability. The patient’s ability to cope with these activities is
      traditionally assessed with questionnaires, which has disadvantages (eg, lack of 
      reliability and sensitivity). Several groups have proposed sensor-based systems
      to recognize and quantify these activities in the patient’s home. Combined with
      Web technology, these systems can inform caregivers about their patients in
      real-time (eg, via smartphone). Objective: We hypothesize that a non-intrusive
      system, which does not use body-mounted sensors, video-based imaging, and
      microphone recordings would be better suited for use in dementia patients. Since 
      it does not require patient’s attention and compliance, such a system might be
      well accepted by patients. We present a passive, Web-based, non-intrusive,
      assistive technology system that recognizes and classifies ADL. Methods: The
      components of this novel assistive technology system were wireless sensors
      distributed in every room of the participant’s home and a central computer unit
      (CCU). The environmental data were acquired for 20 days (per participant) and
      then stored and processed on the CCU. In consultation with medical experts, eight
      ADL were classified. Results: In this study, 10 healthy participants (6 women, 4 
      men; mean age 48.8 years; SD 20.0 years; age range 28-79 years) were included.
      For explorative purposes, one female Alzheimer patient (Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment score=23, Timed Up and Go=19.8 seconds, Trail Making Test A=84.3
      seconds, Trail Making Test B=146 seconds) was measured in parallel with the
      healthy subjects. In total, 1317 ADL were performed by the participants, 1211 ADL
      were classified correctly, and 106 ADL were missed. This led to an overall
      sensitivity of 91.27% and a specificity of 92.52%. Each subject performed an
      average of 134.8 ADL (SD 75). Conclusions: The non-intrusive wireless sensor
      system can acquire environmental data essential for the classification of
      activities of daily living. By analyzing retrieved data, it is possible to
      distinguish and assign data patterns to subjects' specific activities and to
      identify eight different activities in daily living. The Web-based technology
      allows the system to improve care and provides valuable information about the
      patient in real-time.

TI  - Routing in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks: A Leader-Based Approach †.
LID - 1587
AB  - This paper presents a leader-based approach to routing in Mobile Wireless Sensor 
      Networks (MWSN). Using local information from neighbour nodes, a leader election 
      mechanism maintains a spanning tree in order to provide the necessary adaptations
      for efficient routing upon the connectivity changes resulting from the mobility
      of sensors or sink nodes. We present two protocols following the leader election 
      approach, which have been implemented using Castalia and OMNeT++. The protocols
      have been evaluated, besides other reference MWSN routing protocols, to analyse
      the impact of network size and node velocity on performance, which has
      demonstrated the validity of our approach.

TI  - AGING IN THE RIGHT PLACE COPING REPERTOIRES: THE SUBSTITUTABILITY OF CONNECTIVITY
      ALTERNATIVES.
PG  - 664
AB  - Older people often feel incompetent and out of control when they cannot easily
      reach destinations to achieve their shopping, social, recreational, and health
      care needs. Consequently, they have more difficulty aging in place when they lack
      easy-to-use transportation options. However, the availability of traditional auto
      and transit modes of transportation is becoming a less predictive residential
      relocation influence. Rather, the coping repertoires of older people now include 
      alternative connectivity options such as demand-responsive auto services like
      Uber, home-delivered products and services, elder villages, new urbanism
      communities, housing with services, and telemedicine, smart home, and robotic
      information and communication technologies. Driverless cars will be available in 
      the near future. This paper’s theoretical analysis considers the psychological,
      social, economic, and political benefits and costs of substituting these
      connectivity options. Explaining the future aging in the right place behaviors of
      older people will require a greater understanding of these tradeoffs.

PG  - 331-7
AB  - Aging in place is a preferred and cost effective living option for older adults. 
      Research indicates that technology can assist with this goal. Information on
      consumer preferences will help in technology development to assist older adults
      to age in place. The study aim is to explore the perceptions and preferences of
      older adults and their family members about a fall risk assessment system.Using a
      qualitative approach, this study examined the perceptions, attitudes, and
      preferences of 13 older adults and 5 family members about their experience living
      with the fall risk assessment system over five points in time. Themes emerged in 
      relation to preferences and expectations about the technology and how it fits
      into daily routine. We were able to capture changes that occurred over time for
      older adult participants.Results indicated that there is an acceptance of the
      technology as participants adapted to it. Two themes were present across the five
      points in time – safety and usefulness. Five stages of acceptance emerged from
      the data from pre-installation to two years post installation. Identified themes,
      stages of acceptance and design and development considerations are discussed.

TI  - Neuropsychological Test Selection for Cognitive Impairment Classification: A
      Machine Learning Approach.
PG  - 899-916
AB  - Introduction: Reducing the amount of testing required to accurately detect
      cognitive impairment is clinically relevant. The aim of this research was to
      determine the fewest number of clinical measures required to accurately classify 
      participants as healthy older adult, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia 
      using a suite of classification techniques. Methods: Two variable selection
      machine learning models (i.e., naive Bayes, decision tree), a logistic
      regression, and two participant datasets (i.e., clinical diagnosis, clinical
      dementia rating; CDR) were explored. Participants classified using clinical
      diagnosis criteria included 52 individuals with dementia, 97 with MCI, and 161
      cognitively healthy older adults. Participants classified using CDR included 154 
      individuals CDR = 0, 93 individuals with CDR = 0.5, and 25 individuals with CDR =
      1.0+. Twenty-seven demographic, psychological, and neuropsychological variables
      were available for variable selection. Results: No significant difference was
      observed between naive Bayes, decision tree, and logistic regression models for
      classification of both clinical diagnosis and CDR datasets. Participant
      classification (70.0 – 99.1%), geometric mean (60.9 – 98.1%), sensitivity (44.2 –
      100%), and specificity (52.7 – 100%) were generally satisfactory. Unsurprisingly,
      the MCI/CDR = 0.5 participant group was the most challenging to classify. Through
      variable selection only 2 – 9 variables were required for classification and
      varied between datasets in a clinically meaningful way. Conclusions: The current 
      study results reveal that machine learning techniques can accurately classifying 
      cognitive impairment and reduce the number of measures required for diagnosis.

TI  - A Patient-Centered Mobile Phone App (iHeartU) With a Virtual Human Assistant for 
      Self-Management of Heart Failure: Protocol for a Usability Assessment Study.
LID - e13502
AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) causes significant economic and humanistic burden 
      for patients and their families, especially those with a low income, partly due
      to high hospital readmission rates. Optimal self-care is considered an important 
      nonpharmacological aspect of HF management that can improve health outcomes.
      Emerging evidence suggests that self-management assisted by smartphone apps may
      reduce rehospitalization rates and improve the quality of life of patients. We
      developed a virtual human–assisted, patient-centered mobile health app (iHeartU) 
      for patients with HF to enhance their engagement in self-management and improve
      their communication with health care providers and family caregivers. iHeartU may
      help patients with HF in self-management to reduce the technical knowledge and
      usability barrier while maintaining a low cost and natural, effective social
      interaction with the user. Objective: With a standardized systematic usability
      assessment, this study had two objectives: (1) to determine the obstacles to
      effective and efficient use of iHeartU in patients with HF and (2) to evaluate of
      HF patients’ adoption, satisfaction, and engagement with regard to the of iHeartU
      app. Methods: The basic methodology to develop iHeartU systems consists of a
      user-centric design, development, and mixed methods formative evaluation. The
      iterative design and evaluation are based on the guidelines of the American
      College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association for the
      management of heart failure and the validated “Information, Motivation, and
      Behavioral skills” behavior change model. Our hypothesis is that this method of a
      user-centric design will generate a more usable, useful, and easy-to-use mobile
      health system for patients, caregivers, and practitioners. Results: The prototype
      of iHeartU has been developed. It is currently undergoing usability testing. As
      of September 2018, the first round of usability testing data have been collected.
      The final data collection and analysis are expected to be completed by the end of
      2019. Conclusions: The main contribution of this project is the development of a 
      patient-centered self-management system, which may support HF patients’ self-care
      at home and aid in the communication between patients and their health care
      providers in a more effective and efficient way. Widely available mobile phones
      serve as care coordination and “no-cost” continuum of care. For low-income
      patients with HF, a mobile self-management tool will expand their accessibility
      to care and reduce the cost incurred due to emergency visits or readmissions. The
      user-centered design will improve the level of engagement of patients and
      ultimately lead to better health outcomes. Developing and testing a novel mobile 
      system for patients with HF that incorporates chronic disease management is
      critical for advancing research and clinical practice of care for them. This
      research fills in the gap in user-centric design and lays the groundwork for a
      large-scale population study in the next phase. International Registered Report

TI  - Comparing Information Needs of Health Care Providers and Older Adults: Findings
      from a Wellness Study.
PG  - 18-22
AB  - Consumer health informatics technologies have the potential to enhance shared
      decision-making and communication between older adults, health care providers,
      and other stakeholders. The objective of this study was to characterize the
      information needs of these stakeholders to inform the design of informatics tools
      that support wellness in older adults. We conducted four focus groups with 31
      older adults and three focus groups with 10 health care providers to explore
      information needs, goals, and preferences for information sharing. Analysis of
      focus group transcripts was performed to identify and compare themes for
      different stakeholders. We identified four themes related to information
      activities: perceived goals of others, perceived information needs of others,
      information sharing by older adults, and role of family members. Older adults,
      family members and health care providers differ in their information needs. We
      provide recommendations to facilitate design and adoption of informatics tools
      that connect these stakeholders. Larger studies are needed to characterize
      different stakeholder goals, information needs and preferences.

TI  - Cross-National User Priorities for Housing Provision and Accessibility — Findings
      from the European innovAge Project.
PG  - 2670-86
AB  - To develop an innovative information and communication technology (ICT) tool
      intended to help older people in their search for optimal housing solutions, a
      first step in the development process is to gain knowledge from the intended
      users. Thus the aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge about needs and
      expectations about housing options as expressed and prioritized by older people, 
      people ageing with disabilities and professionals. A participatory design focus
      was adopted; 26 people with a range of functional limitations representing the
      user perspective and 15 professionals with a variety of backgrounds, participated
      in research circles that were conducted in four European countries. An additional
      20 experts were invited as guests to the different research circle meetings.
      Three themes illustrating cross-national user priorities for housing provision
      and accessibility were identified: “Information barrier: accessible housing”,
      “Information barrier: housing adaptation benefits”, and “Cost barrier: housing
      adaptations”. In conclusion, early user involvement and identification of
      cross-national differences in priorities and housing options will strengthen the 
      development of a user-friendly ICT tool that can empower older people and people 
      with disabilities to be more active consumers regarding housing provision.

TI  - Wearable Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition Method with Multi-Features
      Extracted from Hilbert-Huang Transform.
LID - 2048
AB  - Wearable sensors-based human activity recognition introduces many useful
      applications and services in health care, rehabilitation training, elderly
      monitoring and many other areas of human interaction. Existing works in this
      field mainly focus on recognizing activities by using traditional features
      extracted from Fourier transform (FT) or wavelet transform (WT). However, these
      signal processing approaches are suitable for a linear signal but not for a
      nonlinear signal. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of the
      Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for dealing with activity data with properties such
      as nonlinearity and non-stationarity. A multi-features extraction method based on
      HHT is then proposed to improve the effect of activity recognition. The extracted
      multi-features include instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency
      (IF) by means of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), as well as instantaneous
      energy density (IE) and marginal spectrum (MS) derived from Hilbert spectral
      analysis. Experimental studies are performed to verify the proposed approach by
      using the PAMAP2 dataset from the University of California, Irvine for wearable
      sensors-based activity recognition. Moreover, the effect of combining
      multi-features vs. a single-feature are investigated and discussed in the
      scenario of a dependent subject. The experimental results show that
      multi-features combination can further improve the performance measures. Finally,
      we test the effect of multi-features combination in the scenario of an
      independent subject. Our experimental results show that we achieve four
      performance indexes: recall, precision, F-measure, and accuracy to 0.9337,
      0.9417, 0.9353, and 0.9377 respectively, which are all better than the
      achievements of related works.

TI  - Development of an automated speech recognition interface for personal emergency
      response systems.
PG  - 26
AB  - Background: Demands on long-term-care facilities are predicted to increase at an 
      unprecedented rate as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age.
      Aging-in-place (i.e. aging at home) is the desire of most seniors and is also a
      good option to reduce the burden on an over-stretched long-term-care system.
      Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERSs) help enable older adults to
      age-in-place by providing them with immediate access to emergency assistance.
      Traditionally they operate with push-button activators that connect the occupant 
      via speaker-phone to a live emergency call-centre operator. If occupants do not
      wear the push button or cannot access the button, then the system is useless in
      the event of a fall or emergency. Additionally, a false alarm or failure to
      check-in at a regular interval will trigger a connection to a live operator,
      which can be unwanted and intrusive to the occupant. This paper describes the
      development and testing of an automated, hands-free, dialogue-based PERS
      prototype. Methods: The prototype system was built using a ceiling mounted
      microphone array, an open-source automatic speech recognition engine, and a 'yes'
      and 'no' response dialog modelled after an existing call-centre protocol. Testing
      compared a single microphone versus a microphone array with nine adults in both
      noisy and quiet conditions. Dialogue testing was completed with four adults.
      Results and discussion: The microphone array demonstrated improvement over the
      single microphone. In all cases, dialog testing resulted in the system reaching
      the correct decision about the kind of assistance the user was requesting.
      Further testing is required with elderly voices and under different noise
      conditions to ensure the appropriateness of the technology. Future developments
      include integration of the system with an emergency detection method as well as
      communication enhancement using features such as barge-in capability. Conclusion:
      The use of an automated dialog-based PERS has the potential to provide users with
      more autonomy in decisions regarding their own health and more privacy in their
      own home.

PG  - 89-97
AB  - Objective: The overall objective of this project was to identify consumers'
      opinions of their needs and wants related to assistive technology (AT) in a
      systematic and quantitative manner via a questionnaire that can be used to
      validate existing and establish new research priorities. Methods: This pilot
      study describes questionnaire development, online implementation, and revisions
      considered to the questionnaire in preparation for conducting a nationwide
      survey. Data from a sample (N = 112) are presented. The pilot study was critical 
      to refine the questions and ensure that meaningful information was being
      collected. Results: It was identified that revisions were warranted to provide
      more structure and allow for consumers to prioritize AT research efforts.
      Conclusion: The questionnaire results, although positively in favor of many of
      the technologies presented, are inconclusive to identify generalizable research
      priorities, thus expansion to a nationwide population is warranted.

TI  - Activity Recognition Using Community Data to Complement Small Amounts of Labeled 
      Instances †.
LID - 877
AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an important part of ambient intelligence
      systems since it can provide user-context information, thus allowing a greater
      personalization of services. One of the problems with HAR systems is that the
      labeling process for the training data is costly, which has hindered its
      practical application. A common approach is to train a general model with the
      aggregated data from all users. The problem is that for a new target user, this
      model can perform poorly because it is biased towards the majority type of users 
      and does not take into account the particular characteristics of the target user.
      To overcome this limitation, a user-dependent model can be trained with data only
      from the target user that will be optimal for this particular user; however, this
      requires a considerable amount of labeled data, which is cumbersome to obtain. In
      this work, we propose a method to build a personalized model for a given target
      user that does not require large amounts of labeled data. Our method uses data
      already labeled by a community of users to complement the scarce labeled data of 
      the target user. Our results showed that the personalized model outperformed the 
      general and the user-dependent models when labeled data is scarce.

TI  - The COACH prompting system to assist older adults with dementia through
      handwashing: An efficacy study.
PG  - 28
AB  - Background: Many older adults with dementia require constant assistance from a
      caregiver when completing activities of daily living (ADL). This study examines
      the efficacy of a computerized device intended to assist people with dementia
      through ADL, while reducing caregiver burden. The device, called COACH, uses
      artificial intelligence to autonomously guide an older adult with dementia
      through the ADL using audio and/or audio-video prompts. Methods: Six older adults
      with moderate-to-severe dementia participated in this study. Handwashing was
      chosen as the target ADL. A single subject research design was used with two
      alternating baseline (COACH not used) and intervention (COACH used) phases. The
      data were analyzed to investigate the impact of COACH on the participants'
      independence and caregiver burden as well as COACH's overall performance for the 
      activity of handwashing. Results: Participants with moderate-level dementia were 
      able to complete an average of 11% more handwashing steps independently and
      required 60% fewer interactions with a human caregiver when COACH was in use.
      Four of the participants achieved complete or very close to complete
      independence. Interestingly, participants' MMSE scores did not appear to robustly
      coincide with handwashing performance and/or responsiveness to COACH; other
      idiosyncrasies of each individual seem to play a stronger role. While the
      majority (78%) of COACH's actions were considered clinically correct, areas for
      improvement were identified. Conclusion: The COACH system shows promise as a tool
      to help support older adults with moderate-levels of dementia and their
      caregivers. These findings reinforce the need for flexibility and dynamic
      personalization in devices designed to assist older adults with dementia. After
      addressing identified improvements, the authors plan to run clinical trials with 
      a sample of community-dwelling older adults and caregivers.

TI  - A Survey on the Feasibility of Sound Classification on Wireless Sensor Nodes.
PG  - 7462-98
AB  - Wireless sensor networks are suitable to gain context awareness for indoor
      environments. As sound waves form a rich source of context information, equipping
      the nodes with microphones can be of great benefit. The algorithms to extract
      features from sound waves are often highly computationally intensive. This can be
      problematic as wireless nodes are usually restricted in resources. In order to be
      able to make a proper decision about which features to use, we survey how sound
      is used in the literature for global sound classification, age and gender
      classification, emotion recognition, person verification and identification and
      indoor and outdoor environmental sound classification. The results of the
      surveyed algorithms are compared with respect to accuracy and computational load.
      The accuracies are taken from the surveyed papers; the computational loads are
      determined by benchmarking the algorithms on an actual sensor node. We conclude
      that for indoor context awareness, the low-cost algorithms for feature extraction
      perform equally well as the more computationally-intensive variants. As the
      feature extraction still requires a large amount of processing time, we present
      four possible strategies to deal with this problem.

TI  - Automated Detection of Activity Transitions for Prompting.
PG  - 575-85
AB  - Individuals with cognitive impairment can benefit from intervention strategies
      like recording important information in a memory notebook. However, training
      individuals to use the notebook on a regular basis requires a constant delivery
      of reminders. In this work, we design and evaluate machine learning-based methods
      for providing automated reminders using a digital memory notebook interface.
      Specifically, we identify transition periods between activities as times to issue
      prompts. We consider the problem of detecting activity transitions using
      supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, and find that both
      techniques show promising results for detecting transition periods. We test the
      techniques in a scripted setting with 15 individuals. Motion sensors data is
      recorded and annotated as participants perform a fixed set of activities. We also
      test the techniques in an unscripted setting with 8 individuals. Motion sensor
      data is recorded as participants go about their normal daily routine. In both the
      scripted and unscripted settings a true positive rate of greater than 80% can be 
      achieved while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 15%. On average,
      this leads to transitions being detected within 1 minute of a true transition for
      the scripted data and within 2 minutes of a true transition on the unscripted
      data.

TI  - An Adaptive System for Home Monitoring Using a Multiagent Classification of
      Patterns.
LID - 136054
AB  - This research takes place in the S(MA)2D project which proposes software
      architecture to monitor elderly people in their own homes. We want to build
      patterns dynamically from data about activity, movements, and physiological
      information of the monitored people. To achieve that, we propose a multiagent
      method of classification: every agent has a simple know-how of classification.
      Data generated at this local level are communicated and adjusted between agents
      to obtain a set of patterns. The patterns are used at a personal level, for
      example to raise an alert, but also to evaluate global risks (epidemic, heat
      wave). These data are dynamic; the system has to maintain the built patterns and 
      has to create new patterns. So, the system is adaptive and can be spread on a
      large scale.

TI  - Economic evaluations of eHealth technologies: A systematic review.
LID - e0198112
AB  - Background: Innovations in eHealth technologies have the potential to help older 
      adults live independently, maintain their quality of life, and to reduce their
      health system dependency and health care expenditure. The objective of this study
      was to systematically review and appraise the quality of cost-effectiveness or
      utility studies assessing eHealth technologies in study populations involving
      older adults. Methods: We systematically searched multiple databases (MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, CINAHL, NHS EED, and PsycINFO) for peer-reviewed studies published in
      English from 2000 to 2016 that examined cost-effectiveness (or utility) of
      eHealth technologies. The reporting quality of included studies was appraised
      using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement. 
      Results: Eleven full text articles met the inclusion criteria representing public
      and private health care systems. eHealth technologies evaluated by these studies 
      includes computerized decision support system, a web-based physical activity
      intervention, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy, telecare, and
      telehealth. Overall, the reporting quality of the studies included in the review 
      was varied. Most studies demonstrated efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an
      intervention using a randomized control trial and statistical modeling,
      respectively. This review found limited information on the feasibility of
      adopting these technologies based on economic and organizational factors.
      Conclusions: This review identified few economic evaluations of eHealth
      technologies that included older adults. The quality of the current evidence is
      limited and further research is warranted to clearly demonstrate the long-term
      cost-effectiveness of eHealth technologies from the health care system and
      societal perspectives.

TI  - Home Camera-Based Fall Detection System for the Elderly.
LID - 2864
AB  - Falls are the leading cause of injury and death in elderly individuals.
      Unfortunately, fall detectors are typically based on wearable devices, and the
      elderly often forget to wear them. In addition, fall detectors based on
      artificial vision are not yet available on the market. In this paper, we present 
      a new low-cost fall detector for smart homes based on artificial vision
      algorithms. Our detector combines several algorithms (background subtraction,
      Kalman filtering and optical flow) as input to a machine learning algorithm with 
      high detection accuracy. Tests conducted on over 50 different fall videos have
      shown a detection ratio of greater than 96%.

TI  - A battery-less and wireless wearable sensor system for identifying bed and chair 
      exits in a pilot trial in hospitalized older people.
LID - e0185670
AB  - Falls in hospitals are common, therefore strategies to minimize the impact of
      these events in older patients and needs to be examined. In this pilot study, we 
      investigate a movement monitoring sensor system for identifying bed and chair
      exits using a wireless wearable sensor worn by hospitalized older patients. We
      developed a movement monitoring sensor system that recognizes bed and chair
      exits. The system consists of a machine learning based activity classifier and a 
      bed and chair exit recognition process based on an activity score function.
      Twenty-six patients, aged 71 to 93 years old, hospitalized in the Geriatric
      Evaluation and Management Unit participated in the supervised trials. They wore
      over their attire a battery-less, lightweight and wireless sensor and performed
      scripted activities such as getting off the bed and chair. We investigated the
      system performance in recognizing bed and chair exits in hospital rooms where
      RFID antennas and readers were in place. The system’s acceptability was measured 
      using two surveys with 0–10 likert scales. The first survey measured the change
      in user perception of the system before and after a trial; the second survey,
      conducted only at the end of each trial, measured user acceptance of the system
      based on a multifactor sensor acceptance model. The performance of the system
      indicated an overall recall of 81.4%, precision of 66.8% and F-score of 72.4% for
      joint bed and chair exit recognition. Patients demonstrated improved perception
      of the system after use with overall score change from 7.8 to 9.0 and high
      acceptance of the system with score ≥ 6.7 for all acceptance factors. The present
      pilot study suggests the use of wireless wearable sensors is feasible for
      detecting bed and chair exits in a hospital environment.

TI  - Technology use by rural and urban oldest old.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Objectives: Technologies designed to optimally maintain older people as they age 
      in their desired places of residence are proliferating. An important step in
      designing and deploying such technologies is to determine the current use and
      familiarity with technology in general among older people. The goal of this study
      was to determine the extent that community-dwelling elderly at highest risk of
      losing independence, the oldest old, use common electronic devices found in
      residential urban or rural settings. Methods: We surveyed 306 nondemented elderly
      age 85 or over; 144 were part of a rural aging study, the Klamath Exceptional
      Aging Project, and 181 were from an urban aging cohort in Portland. Results: The 
      most frequently used devices were televisions, microwave ovens, and answering
      machines. Persons with mild cognitive impairment were less likely to use all
      devices than those with no impairment. Higher socioeconomic status and education 
      were associated with use of more complicated devices. Urban respondents were more
      likely than rural ones to use most devices. Conclusion: Technology use by very
      old community-dwelling elderly is common. There are significant differences in
      use between rural and urban elderly.

TI  - Perspectives of Stakeholders on Technology Use in the Care of Community-Living
      Older Adults with Dementia: A Systematic Literature Review.
LID - 73
AB  - Although technology has the potential to promote aging in place, the use of
      technology remains scarce among community-living older adults with dementia. A
      reason might be that many stakeholders are involved who all have a different
      perspective on technology use (i.e., needs, wishes, attitudes, possibilities, and
      difficulties). We systematically searched the literature in order to provide an
      overview of perspectives of different stakeholders on technology use among
      community-living older adults with dementia. After selection, 46 studies were
      included. We mainly found perspectives of informal caregivers and, to a lesser
      extent, of persons with dementia and formal caregivers. Perspectives of suppliers
      of technology were not present. Shared perspectives among persons with dementia
      and informal and formal caregivers were, among other things, ease of use,
      stability and flexibility of technology, importance of privacy, and
      confidentiality. We also found that among older persons, fun and pleasure, in
      addition to enhancing freedom and independence, facilitates technology use.
      Informal caregivers’ peace of mind and relief of burden also appeared to be
      important in using technologies. Formal caregivers value the potential of
      technologies to improve monitoring and communication. Insight in shared, and
      conflicting perspectives of stakeholders are essential to enhance the use of
      technology.

TI  - Hospital daily outpatient visits forecasting using a combinatorial model based on
      ARIMA and SES models.
LID - 469
AB  - Background: Accurate forecasting of hospital outpatient visits is beneficial for 
      the reasonable planning and allocation of healthcare resource to meet the medical
      demands. In terms of the multiple attributes of daily outpatient visits, such as 
      randomness, cyclicity and trend, time series methods, ARIMA, can be a good choice
      for outpatient visits forecasting. On the other hand, the hospital outpatient
      visits are also affected by the doctors’ scheduling and the effects are not pure 
      random. Thinking about the impure specialty, this paper presents a new
      forecasting model that takes cyclicity and the day of the week effect into
      consideration. Methods: We formulate a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model on a daily
      time series and then a single exponential smoothing (SES) model on the day of the
      week time series, and finally establish a combinatorial model by modifying them. 
      The models are applied to 1 year of daily visits data of urban outpatients in two
      internal medicine departments of a large hospital in Chengdu, for forecasting the
      daily outpatient visits about 1 week ahead. Results: The proposed model is
      applied to forecast the cross-sectional data for 7 consecutive days of daily
      outpatient visits over an 8-weeks period based on 43 weeks of observation data
      during 1 year. The results show that the two single traditional models and the
      combinatorial model are simplicity of implementation and low computational
      intensiveness, whilst being appropriate for short-term forecast horizons.
      Furthermore, the combinatorial model can capture the comprehensive features of
      the time series data better. Conclusions: Combinatorial model can achieve better 
      prediction performance than the single model, with lower residuals variance and
      small mean of residual errors which needs to be optimized deeply on the next
      research step.

TI  - Wandering as a Sociomaterial Practice: Extending the Theorization of GPS Tracking
      in Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 328-44
AB  - Electronic tracking through global positioning systems (GPSs) is used to monitor 
      people with cognitive impairment who “wander” outside the home. This ethnographic
      study explored how GPS-monitored wandering was experienced by individuals, lay
      carers, and professional staff. Seven in-depth case studies revealed that
      wandering was often an enjoyable and worthwhile activity and helped deal with
      uncertainty and threats to identity. In what were typically very complex care
      contexts, GPS devices were useful to the extent that they aligned with a wider
      sociomaterial care network that included lay carers, call centers, and health and
      social care professionals.In this context, “safe” wandering was a collaborative
      accomplishment that depended on the technology’s materiality, affordances, and
      aesthetic properties; a distributed knowledge of the individual and the places
      they wandered through, and a collective and dynamic interpretation of risk.
      Implications for design and delivery of GPS devices and services for cognitive
      impairment are discussed.

TI  - Mechano-regulated metal–organic framework nanofilm for ultrasensitive and
      anti-jamming strain sensing.
LID - 3813
AB  - The development of ultrasensitive, anti-jamming, and durable sensors that can
      precisely distinguish different human body motions are of great importance for
      smart health monitoring and diagnosis. Physical implementation of such flexible
      sensors is still a challenge at the moment. Combining the designs of advanced
      material showing excellent electrochemical properties with the facilitative
      structure engineering, high-performance flexible sensors that satisfy both signal
      detecting and recognition requirements may be made possible. Here we report the
      first metal–organic framework-based strain sensor with accurate signal detection 
      and noise-screening properties. Upon doping the tricarboxytriphenyl amine-based
      metal–organic framework nanofilm with iodine, the two-terminal device exhibits
      ultrahigh sensitivity with a gauge factor exceeding 10,000 in the 2.5% to 3.3%
      deformation range for over 5000 dynamic operating cycles and out-of-scale
      noise-screening capability. The high-performance strain sensor can easily
      differentiate the moderate muscle hyperspasmia from subtle swaying and vigorous
      sporting activities.

TI  - A Qualitative Study of Rural Primary Care Clinician Views on Remote Monitoring
      Technologies.
LID - 10.1111/jrh.12027
AB  - Purpose: Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) may improve quality of care,
      reduce access barriers, and help control medical costs. Despite the role of
      primary care clinicians as potential key users of RMTs, few studies explore their
      views. This study explores rural primary care clinician interest and the
      resources necessary to incorporate RMTs into routine practice. Methods: We
      conducted 15 in-depth interviews with rural primary care clinician members of the
      Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) from November 2011 to April 
      2012. Our multidisciplinary team used thematic analysis to identify emergent
      themes and a cross-case comparative analysis to explore variation by participant 
      and practice characteristics. Results: Clinicians expressed interest in RMTs most
      relevant to their clinical practice, such as supporting chronic disease
      management, noting benefits to patients of all ages. They expressed concern about
      the quantity of data, patient motivation to utilize equipment, and potential
      changes to the patient-clinician encounter. Direct data transfer into the
      clinic’s electronic health record (EHR), availability in multiple formats, and
      review by ancillary staff could facilitate implementation. Although participants 
      acknowledged the potential system-level benefits of using RMTs, adoption would be
      difficult without payment reform. Conclusions: Adoption of RMTs by rural primary 
      care clinicians may be influenced by equipment purpose and functionality,
      implementation resources, and payment. Clinician and staff engagement will be
      critical to actualize RMT use in routine primary care.

TI  - A Posture Recognition Method Based on Indoor Positioning Technology.
LID - 1464
AB  - Posture recognition has been widely applied in fields such as physical training, 
      environmental awareness, human-computer-interaction, surveillance system and
      elderly health care. The traditional methods consist of two main variations:
      machine vision methods and acceleration sensor methods. The former has the
      disadvantages of privacy invasion, high cost and complex implementation
      processes, while the latter has low recognition rate for still postures. A new
      body posture recognition scheme based on indoor positioning technology is
      presented in this paper. A single deployed indoor positioning system is
      constructed by installing wearable receiving tags at key points of the human
      body. The distance measurement method with ultra-wide band (UWB) radio is applied
      to position the key points of human body. Posture recognition is implemented by
      positioning. In the posture recognition algorithm, least square estimation (LSE) 
      method and the improved extended Kalman filtering (iEKF) algorithm are
      respectively adopted to suppress the noise of the distances measurement and to
      improve the accuracy of positioning and recognition. The comparison of simulation
      results with the two methods shows that the improved extended Kalman filtering
      algorithm is more effective in error performance.

TI  - Nighttime Restfulness During Daytime Dance Therapy: An Exploratory Study Using
      Bed Sensors.
PG  - 362-73
AB  - Dance-based therapy has the potential to slow the progression of functional
      limitations in older adults. The purpose of this study was to explore the
      feasibility of measuring the impact of dance-based therapy on the nighttime
      restfulness patterns of older adults in an aging-in-place facility using passive 
      bed sensors. A secondary data analysis of the continuous 2-month nighttime bed
      sensor data was reviewed for measurable change during a dance study. A measurable
      variation in nighttime restfulness level was detected between the dancers and
      nondancers, and no high or very high restlessness was detected during this period
      for the dance-based therapy group. Although these exploratory variations are
      modest, the findings suggest that bed sensors can be used to measure nighttime
      restfulness following a therapeutic dance intervention. More research is needed
      in this emerging area.

PG  - 7-28
AB  - This study examined the types of physical activity (PA) retirement community
      residents report and the effects of PA and depressive symptoms on functional
      limitations. Elders (N = 38) enrolled in a 2-year sensor technology study in
      senior housing completed regular assessments of functional limitations and
      depressive symptoms with the Short Physical Performance Battery and Geriatric
      Depression Scale, respectively. Evaluation of reported PA using the Physical
      Activity Scale for the Elderly coincided with 12-month functional limitation
      testing. Subjects were 69% female with mean age of 85 years. Individuals
      reporting greater PA had significantly fewer functional limitations at 12 months.
      In multiple regression analysis, baseline functional limitations explained 66% of
      the variance in 12-month functional limitations, while current PA explained an
      additional 5%. Although PA explained a small amount of variance in 12-month
      functional limitations, as a modifiable behavior, PA should be championed and
      supported to help ameliorate functional limitations in older adults.

TI  - Valuation of Active Blind Spot Detection Systems by Younger and Older Adults.
PG  - 505-14
AB  - Due to their disproportional representation in fatal crashes, younger and older
      drivers both stand to benefit from in-vehicle safety technologies, yet little is 
      known about how they value such technologies, or their willingness to adopt them.
      The current study investigated older (aged 65 and greater; N = 49) and younger
      (ages 18-23; N = 40) adults’ valuation of a blind spot monitor and asked if
      self-reported visual difficulties while driving predicted the amount participants
      were willing to pay for a particular system (BMW's Active Blind Spot Detection
      System) that was demonstrated using a short video. Large and small anchor values 
      ($250 and $500, respectively) were used as between subjects manipulations to
      examine the effects of initial valuation, and participants proceeded through a
      short staircase procedure that offered them either the free installation of the
      system on their current vehicle or a monetary prize ($25-$950) that changed in
      value according to which option they had selected in the previous step of the
      staircase procedure. Willingness to use other advanced driver assistance systems 
      (lane-departure warning, automatic lane centering, emergency braking, adaptive
      cruise control, and self-parking systems) was also analyzed, additionally
      controlling for prior familiarity of those systems. Results showed that increased
      age was associated with a higher valuation for the Active Blind Spot Detection
      System in both the large and small anchor value conditions controlling for
      income, gender, and technology self-efficacy. Older adults valued blind spot
      detection about twice as much ($762) as younger adults ($383) in the large anchor
      condition, though both groups’ values were in the range for the current cost of
      an aftermarket system. Similarly, age was the most robust positive predictor of
      willingness to adopt other driving technologies, along with system familiarity.
      Difficulties with driving-related visual factors also positively predicting

TI  - Examining the impact of familiarity on faucet usability for older adults with
      dementia.
PG  - 63
AB  - Background: Changes in cognition caused by dementia can significantly alter how a
      person perceives familiarity, impacting the recognition and usability of everyday
      products. A person who is unable to use products cannot autonomously complete
      associated activities, resulting in increased dependence on a caregiver and
      potential move to assisted living facilities. The research presented in this
      paper hypothesised that products that are more familiar will result in better
      usability for older adults with dementia. Better product usability could, in
      turn, potentially support independence and autonomy. Methods: This research
      investigated the impact of familiarity on the use of five faucet designs during
      1309 handwashing trials by 27 older adults, who ranged from cognitively intact to
      the advanced (severe) stages of dementia. Human factors methods were used to
      collect empirical and self-reported data to gauge faucets’ usability.
      Participants’ data were grouped according to cognition (i.e., no/mild, moderate, 
      or severe dementia). Logistic regression, ranking by odds, and Wald tests of odds
      ratios were used to compare performance of the three groups on the different
      faucets. Qualitative data were used in the interpretation of quantitative
      results. Results: Results indicated that more familiar faucets correlated with
      lower levels of assistance from a caregiver, fewer operational errors, and
      greater levels of operator satisfaction. Aspects such as the ability to control
      water temperature and flow as well as pleasing aesthetics appeared to positively 
      impact participants’ acceptance of a faucet. The dual lever design achieved the
      best overall usability. Conclusions: While work must be done to expand these
      findings to other products and tasks, this research provides evidence that
      familiarity plays a substantial role in product usability for older adults that
      appears to become more influential as dementia progresses. The methods used in
      this research could be adapted to analyse usability for other products by older
      adults with dementia.

TI  - Clustering Home Activity Distributions for Automatic Detection of Mild Cognitive 
      Impairment in Older Adults1.
PG  - 437-51
AB  - The public health implications of growing numbers of older adults at risk for
      dementia places pressure on identifying dementia at its earliest stages so as to 
      develop proactive management plans. The prodromal dementia phase commonly
      identified as mild cognitive impairment is an important target for this early
      detection of impending dementia amenable to treatment. In this paper, we propose 
      a method for home-based automatic detection of mild cognitive impairment in older
      adults through continuous monitoring via unobtrusive sensing technologies. Our
      method is composed of two main stages: a training stage and a test stage. For
      training, room activity distributions are estimated for each subject using a time
      frame of ω weeks, and then affinity propagation is employed to cluster the
      activity distributions and to extract exemplars to represent the different
      emerging clusters. For testing, room activity distributions belonging to a test
      subject with unknown cognitive status are compared to the extracted exemplars and
      get assigned the labels of the exemplars that result in the smallest normalized
      Kullbak–Leibler divergence. The labels of the activity distributions are then
      used to determine the cognitive status of the test subject. Using the sensor and 
      clinical data pertaining to 85 homes with single occupants, we were able to
      automatically detect mild cognitive impairment in older adults with an F0.5 score
      of 0.856. Also, we were able to detect the non-amnestic sub-type of mild
      cognitive impairment in older adults with an F0.5 score of 0.958.

TI  - Perception of Older Adults Toward Smartwatch Technology for Assessing Pain and
      Related Patient-Reported Outcomes: Pilot Study.
LID - e10044
AB  - Background: Chronic pain, including arthritis, affects about 100 million adults
      in the United States. Complexity and diversity of the pain experience across time
      and people and its fluctuations across and within days show the need for valid
      pain reports that do not rely on patient’s long-term recall capability.
      Smartwatches can be used as digital ecological momentary assessment (EMA) tools
      for real-time collection of pain scores. Smartwatches are generally less
      expensive than smartphones, are highly portable, and have a simpler user
      interface, providing an excellent medium for continuous data collection and
      enabling a higher compliance rate. Objective: The aim of this study was to
      explore the attitudes and perceptions of older adults towards design and
      technological aspects of a smartwatch framework for measuring patient report
      outcomes (PRO) as an EMA tool. Methods: A focus group session was conducted to
      explore the perception of participants towards smartwatch technology and its
      utility for PRO assessment. Participants included older adults (age 65+), with
      unilateral or bilateral symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. A preliminary user
      interface with server communication capability was developed and deployed on 10
      Samsung Gear S3 smartwatches and provided to the users during the focus group.
      Pain was designated as the main PRO, while fatigue, mood, and sleep quality were 
      included as auxiliary PROs. Pre-planned topics included participants’ attitude
      towards the smartwatch technology, usability of the custom-designed app
      interface, and suitability of the smartwatch technology for PRO assessment.
      Discussions were transcribed, and content analysis with theme characterization
      was performed to identify and code the major themes. Results: We recruited 19
      participants (age 65+) who consented to take part in the focus group study. The
      overall attitude of the participants toward the smartwatch technology was
      positive. They showed interest in the direct phone-call capability, availability 
      of extra apps such as the weather apps and sensors for tracking health and
      wellness such as accelerometer and heart rate sensor. Nearly three-quarters of
      participants showed willingness to participate in a one-year study to wear the
      watch daily. Concerns were raised regarding usability, including accessibility
      (larger icons), notification customization, and intuitive interface design
      (unambiguous icons and assessment scales). Participants expressed interest in
      using smartwatch technology for PRO assessment and the availability of methods
      for sharing data with health care providers. Conclusions: All participants had
      overall positive views of the smartwatch technology for measuring PROs to
      facilitate patient-provider communications and to provide more targeted
      treatments and interventions in the future. Usability concerns were the major
      issues that will require special consideration in future smartwatch PRO user
      interface designs, especially accessibility issues, notification design, and use 
      of intuitive assessment scales.

AB  - Recent advances in biosensors, medical instrumentation, and information
      processing and communication technologies (ICT) have enabled significant
      improvements in healthcare. However, these technologies have been mainly applied 
      in clinical environments, such as hospitals and healthcare facilities, under
      managed care by well-trained and specialized individuals. The global challenge of
      providing quality healthcare at affordable cost leads to the proposed paradigm of
      P reventive, Personalized, and Precision Medicine that requires a seamless use of
      technology and infrastructure support for patients and healthcare providers at
      point-of-care (POC) locations including homes, semi or pre-clinical facilities,
      and hospitals. The complexity of the global healthcare challenge necessitates
      strong collaborative interdisciplinary synergies involving all stakeholder groups
      including academia, federal research institutions, industry, regulatory agencies,
      and clinical communities. It is critical to evolve with collaborative efforts on 
      the translation of research to technology development toward clinical validation 
      and potential healthcare applications. This special issue is focused on
      technology innovation and translational research for POC applications with
      potential impact in improving global healthcare in the respective areas. Some of 
      these papers were presented at the NIH-IEEE Strategic Conference on Healthcare
      Innovations and POC Technologies for Precision Medicine (HI-POCT) held at the NIH
      on November 9–10, 2015. The papers included in the Special Issue provide a
      spectrum of critical issues and collaborative resources on translational research
      of advanced POC devices and ICT into global healthcare environment.

TI  - Design of a Wireless Sensor Network Platform for Tele-Homecare.
PG  - 17156-75
AB  - The problem of an ageing population has become serious in the past few years as
      the degeneration of various physiological functions has resulted in distinct
      chronic diseases in the elderly. Most elderly are not willing to leave home for
      healthcare centers, but caring for patients at home eats up caregiver resources, 
      and can overwhelm patients' families. Besides, a lot of chronic disease symptoms 
      cause the elderly to visit hospitals frequently. Repeated examinations not only
      exhaust medical resources, but also waste patients' time and effort. To make
      matters worse, this healthcare system does not actually appear to be effective as
      expected. In response to these problems, a wireless remote home care system is
      designed in this study, where ZigBee is used to set up a wireless network for the
      users to take measurements anytime and anywhere. Using suitable measuring
      devices, users' physiological signals are measured, and their daily conditions
      are monitored by various sensors. Being transferred through ZigBee network, vital
      signs are analyzed in computers which deliver distinct alerts to remind the users
      and the family of possible emergencies. The system could be further combined with
      electric appliances to remotely control the users' environmental conditions. The 
      environmental monitoring function can be activated to transmit in real time
      dynamic images of the cared to medical personnel through the video function when 
      emergencies occur. Meanwhile, in consideration of privacy, the video camera would
      be turned on only when it is necessary. The caregiver could adjust the angle of
      camera to a proper position and observe the current situation of the cared when a
      sensor on the cared or the environmental monitoring system detects exceptions.
      All physiological data are stored in the database for family enquiries or
      accurate diagnoses by medical personnel.

TI  - Phone behaviour and its relationship to loneliness in older adults.
PG  - 1084-91
AB  - Objectives: Loneliness and social isolation are two important health outcomes
      among older adults. Current assessment of these outcomes relies on self-report
      which is susceptible to bias. This paper reports on the relationship between
      loneliness and objective measures of isolation using a phone monitoring device.
      Method: Phone monitors were installed in the homes of 26 independent elderly
      individuals from the ORCATECH Life Laboratory cohort (age 86 ± 4.5, 88% female)
      and used to monitor the daily phone usage for an average of 174 days. Loneliness 
      was assessed using the 20-item University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)
      Loneliness scale. A mixed effects negative binomial regression was used to model 
      the relationship between loneliness and social isolation, as assessed using the
      total number of calls, controlling for cognitive function, pain, age, gender, and
      weekday. A secondary analysis examined the differential effect of loneliness on
      incoming and outgoing calls. Results: The average UCLA Loneliness score was 35.3 
      ± 7.6, and the median daily number of calls was 4. Loneliness was negatively
      associated with telephone use (IRR = 0.99, p < 0.05). Daily phone use was also
      associated with gender (IRR = 2.03, p < 0.001) and cognitive status (IRR = 1.51, 
      p < 0.001). The secondary analysis revealed that loneliness was significantly
      related to incoming (IRR = 0.98, p < 0.01) but not outgoing calls. Conclusions:
      These results demonstrate the close relationship between loneliness and social
      isolation, showing that phone behaviour is associated with emotional state and
      cognitive function. Because phone behaviour can be monitored unobtrusively, it
      may be possible to sense loneliness levels in older adults using objective
      assessments of key aspects of behaviour.

TI  - IAServ: An Intelligent Home Care Web Services Platform in a Cloud for
      Aging-in-Place.
PG  - 6106-30
AB  - As the elderly population has been rapidly expanding and the core tax-paying
      population has been shrinking, the need for adequate elderly health and housing
      services continues to grow while the resources to provide such services are
      becoming increasingly scarce. Thus, increasing the efficiency of the delivery of 
      healthcare services through the use of modern technology is a pressing issue. The
      seamless integration of such enabling technologies as ontology, intelligent
      agents, web services, and cloud computing is transforming healthcare from
      hospital-based treatments to home-based self-care and preventive care. A
      ubiquitous healthcare platform based on this technological integration, which
      synergizes service providers with patients’ needs to be developed to provide
      personalized healthcare services at the right time, in the right place, and the
      right manner. This paper presents the development and overall architecture of
      IAServ (the Intelligent Aging-in-place Home care Web Services Platform) to
      provide personalized healthcare service ubiquitously in a cloud computing setting
      to support the most desirable and cost-efficient method of care for the
      aged-aging in place. The IAServ is expected to offer intelligent, pervasive,
      accurate and contextually-aware personal care services. Architecturally the
      implemented IAServ leverages web services and cloud computing to provide
      economic, scalable, and robust healthcare services over the Internet.

      This study systematically reviewed the existing empirical literature on long
      distance caregiving and critically examined 15 identified studies: 8
      quantitative, 2 mixed-method, and 5 qualitative. Although studies defined long
      distance caregiving very differently, a composite description of who long
      distance caregivers are and what they do is presented. Long distance caregivers
      make substantial contributions to care in terms of physical, financial, and
      social support. Distance complicates the exchange of information about the care
      recipient’s health and care needs, as well as the types of care that can be
      provided. Related to this, geographic separation can exacerbate care-related
      stressors. Implications for future research are also identified.

TI  - WiSPH: A Wireless Sensor Network-Based Home Care Monitoring System.
PG  - 7096-119
AB  - This paper presents a system based on WSN technology capable of monitoring heart 
      rate and the rate of motion of seniors within their homes. The system is capable 
      of remotely alerting specialists, caretakers or family members via a smartphone
      of rapid physiological changes due to falls, tachycardia or bradycardia. This
      work was carried out using our workgroup's WiSe platform, which we previously
      developed for use in WSNs. The proposed WSN architecture is flexible, allowing
      for greater scalability to better allow event-based monitoring. The architecture 
      also provides security mechanisms to assure that the monitored and/or stored data
      can only be accessed by authorized individuals or devices. The aforementioned
      characteristics provide the network versatility and solidity required for use in 
      health applications.

TI  - Exposure to “Exergames” Increases Older Adults’ Perception of the Usefulness of
      Technology for Improving Health and Physical Activity: A Pilot Study.
LID - e8
AB  - Background: High rates of sedentary behaviors in older adults can lead to poor
      health outcomes. However, new technologies, namely exercise-based videogames
      (“exergames”), may provide ways of stimulating uptake and ongoing participation
      in physical activities. Older adults’ perceptions of the use of technology to
      improve health are not known. Objective: The study aimed to determine use and
      perceptions of technology before and after using a 5-week exergame. Methods:
      Focus groups determined habitual use of technology and the participant’s
      perceptions of technology to assist with health and physical activity. Surveys
      were developed to quantitatively measure these perceptions and were administered 
      before and after a 5-week intervention. The intervention was an exergame that
      focused on postural balance (“Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012”). Games scores,
      rates of game participation, and enjoyment were also recorded. Results: A total
      of 24 healthy participants aged between 55 and 82 years (mean 70, SD 6 years)
      indicated that after the intervention there was an increased awareness that
      technology (in the form of exergames) can assist with maintaining physical
      activity (P<.001). High levels of enjoyment (Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale
      [PACES-8] score mean 53.0, SE 0.7) and participation rates over the whole study
      (83%-100%) were recorded. Conclusions: Older adults’ have low perception of the
      use of technology for improving health outcomes until after exposure to
      exergames. Technology, in the form of enjoyable exergames, may be useful for
      improving participation in physical activity that is relevant for older adults.

TI  - Policy Concerns Raised by the Growing U.S. Population Aging with Disability.
PG  - S64-8
AB  - The number of Americans aging with disabilities will grow substantially in coming
      decades. Promulgating policies and practices to improve their independent
      functioning within communities and participation in daily life is therefore
      imperative, but the most effective approaches for meeting various needs are
      generally unknown. Historically, research addressing approaches targeting elderly
      individuals have differed in important ways (e.g., underlying models of
      disability) from studies involving younger persons aging with disabilities.
      Participants in a conference addressing this discordance identified six major
      areas requiring study: (1) resources to support independent living; (2) improving
      quality of life and participation in daily activities; (3) performing activities 
      of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADLs; (4) role of families; (5) medical
      care; and (6) concerns transcending sectors. As these investigations move
      forward, bridging the divide between approaches addressing elderly individuals
      versus persons with disabilities will be critical.

TI  - ERMHAN: A Context-Aware Service Platform to Support Continuous Care Networks for 
      Home-Based Assistance.
LID - 867639
AB  - Continuous care models for chronic diseases pose several technology-oriented
      challenges for home-based continuous care, where assistance services rely on a
      close collaboration among different stakeholders such as health operators,
      patient relatives, and social community members. Here we describe Emilia Romagna 
      Mobile Health Assistance Network (ERMHAN) a multichannel context-aware service
      platform designed to support care networks in cooperating and sharing information
      with the goal of improving patient quality of life. In order to meet
      extensibility and flexibility requirements, this platform has been developed
      through ontology-based context-aware computing and a service oriented approach.
      We also provide some preliminary results of performance analysis and user survey 
      activity.

TI  - Usability Study of a Computer-Based Self-Management System for Older Adults with 
      Chronic Diseases.
LID - e13
AB  - Background: Usability can influence patients’ acceptance and adoption of a health
      information technology. However, little research has been conducted to study the 
      usability of a self-management health care system, especially one geared toward
      elderly patients. Objective: This usability study evaluated a new computer-based 
      self-management system interface for older adults with chronic diseases, using a 
      paper prototype approach. Methods: Fifty older adults with different chronic
      diseases participated. Two usability evaluation methods were involved: (1) a
      heuristics evaluation and (2) end-user testing with a think-aloud testing method,
      audio recording, videotaping, and interviewing. A set of usability metrics was
      employed to determine the overall system usability, including task incompletion
      rate, task completion time, frequency of error, frequency of help, satisfaction, 
      perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Interviews were used to elicit
      participants’ comments on the system design. The quantitative data were analyzed 
      using descriptive statistics and the qualitative data were analyzed for content. 
      Results: The participants were able to perform the predesigned self-management
      tasks with the current system design and they expressed mostly positive responses
      about the perceived usability measures regarding the system interface. However,
      the heuristics evaluation, performance measures, and interviews revealed a number
      of usability problems related to system navigation, information search and
      interpretation, information presentation, and readability. Design recommendations
      for further system interface modifications were discussed. Conclusions: This
      study verified the usability of the self-management system developed for older
      adults with chronic diseases. Also, we demonstrated that our usability evaluation
      approach could be used to quickly and effectively identify usability problems in 
      a health care information system at an early stage of the system development
      process using a paper prototype. Conducting a usability evaluation is an
      essential step in system development to ensure that the system features match the
      users’ true needs, expectations, and characteristics, and also to minimize the
      likelihood of the users committing user errors and having difficulties using the 
      system.

TI  - Timing of impairment and health-promoting lifestyles in women with disabilities.
PG  - 816-29
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a substantive theory that explains how
      the timing of impairment in women’s lives influences health-promoting lifestyles 
      among 45 women age 43 to 79 years with impairments of varying onset across the
      life course. From this grounded theory exploration, we suggest that women created
      health-related lifestyles, which were comprised of changing abilities, roles, and
      rituals, in support of perceived self. The ultimate goal of a healthy lifestyle
      was healthy aging, which was self-determination in the support of positive
      relationships. Environment and resources had direct influence on perceived self. 
      Our proposed substantive theory provides an understanding of how women develop a 
      healthy lifestyle after the onset of permanent sensory or physical impairment. It
      also takes steps toward an understanding of how timing of impairment influences
      the perceptions women have of themselves and their health behaviors.

TI  - Technologies That Assess the Location of Physical Activity and Sedentary
      Behavior: A Systematic Review.
LID - e192
AB  - Background: The location in which physical activity and sedentary behavior are
      performed can provide valuable behavioral information, both in isolation and
      synergistically with other areas of physical activity and sedentary behavior
      research. Global positioning systems (GPS) have been used in physical activity
      research to identify outdoor location; however, while GPS can receive signals in 
      certain indoor environments, it is not able to provide room- or subroom-level
      location. On average, adults spend a high proportion of their time indoors. A
      measure of indoor location would, therefore, provide valuable behavioral
      information. Objective: This systematic review sought to identify and critique
      technology which has been or could be used to assess the location of physical
      activity and sedentary behavior. Methods: To identify published research papers, 
      four electronic databases were searched using key terms built around behavior,
      technology, and location. To be eligible for inclusion, papers were required to
      be published in English and describe a wearable or portable technology or device 
      capable of measuring location. Searches were performed up to February 4, 2015.
      This was supplemented by backward and forward reference searching. In an attempt 
      to include novel devices which may not yet have made their way into the published
      research, searches were also performed using three Internet search engines.
      Specialized software was used to download search results and thus mitigate the
      potential pitfalls of changing search algorithms. Results: A total of 188
      research papers met the inclusion criteria. Global positioning systems were the
      most widely used location technology in the published research, followed by
      wearable cameras, and radio-frequency identification. Internet search engines
      identified 81 global positioning systems, 35 real-time locating systems, and 21
      wearable cameras. Real-time locating systems determine the indoor location of a
      wearable tag via the known location of reference nodes. Although the type of
      reference node and location determination method varies between manufacturers,
      Wi-Fi appears to be the most popular method. Conclusions: The addition of
      location information to existing measures of physical activity and sedentary
      behavior will provide important behavioral information.

LID - 2164
AB  - Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a dramatic rise in life expectancy
      owing to significant advances in medical science and technology, medicine as well
      as increased awareness about nutrition, education, and environmental and personal
      hygiene. Consequently, the elderly population in many countries are expected to
      rise rapidly in the coming years. A rapidly rising elderly demographics is
      expected to adversely affect the socioeconomic systems of many nations in terms
      of costs associated with their healthcare and wellbeing. In addition, diseases
      related to the cardiovascular system, eye, respiratory system, skin and mental
      health are widespread globally. However, most of these diseases can be avoided
      and/or properly managed through continuous monitoring. In order to enable
      continuous health monitoring as well as to serve growing healthcare needs;
      affordable, non-invasive and easy-to-use healthcare solutions are critical. The
      ever-increasing penetration of smartphones, coupled with embedded sensors and
      modern communication technologies, make it an attractive technology for enabling 
      continuous and remote monitoring of an individual’s health and wellbeing with
      negligible additional costs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of 
      the state-of-the-art research and developments in smartphone-sensor based
      healthcare technologies. A discussion on regulatory policies for medical devices 
      and their implications in smartphone-based healthcare systems is presented.
      Finally, some future research perspectives and concerns regarding
      smartphone-based healthcare systems are described.

TI  - How Accurate Is Your Activity Tracker? A Comparative Study of Step Counts in
      Low-Intensity Physical Activities.
LID - e106
AB  - Background: As commercially available activity trackers are being utilized in
      clinical trials, the research community remains uncertain about reliability of
      the trackers, particularly in studies that involve walking aids and low-intensity
      activities. While these trackers have been tested for reliability during walking 
      and running activities, there has been limited research on validating them during
      low-intensity activities and walking with assistive tools. Objective: The aim of 
      this study was to (1) determine the accuracy of 3 Fitbit devices (ie, Zip, One,
      and Flex) at different wearing positions (ie, pants pocket, chest, and wrist)
      during walking at 3 different speeds, 2.5, 5, and 8 km/h, performed by healthy
      adults on a treadmill; (2) determine the accuracy of the mentioned trackers worn 
      at different sites during activities of daily living; and (3) examine whether
      intensity of physical activity (PA) impacts the choice of optimal wearing site of
      the tracker. Methods: We recruited 15 healthy young adults to perform 6 PAs while
      wearing 3 Fitbit devices (ie, Zip, One, and Flex) on their chest, pants pocket,
      and wrist. The activities include walking at 2.5, 5, and 8 km/h, pushing a
      shopping cart, walking with aid of a walker, and eating while sitting. We
      compared the number of steps counted by each tracker with gold standard numbers. 
      We performed multiple statistical analyses to compute descriptive statistics (ie,
      ANOVA test), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), mean absolute error rate, 
      and correlation by comparing the tracker-recorded data with that of the gold
      standard. Results: All the 3 trackers demonstrated good-to-excellent (ICC>0.75)
      correlation with the gold standard step counts during treadmill experiments. The 
      correlation was poor (ICC<0.60), and the error rate was significantly higher in
      walker experiment compared to other activities. There was no significant
      difference between the trackers and the gold standard in the shopping cart
      experiment. The wrist worn tracker, Flex, counted several steps when eating
      (P<.01). The chest tracker was identified as the most promising site to capture
      steps in more intense activities, while the wrist was the optimal wearing site in
      less intense activities. Conclusions: This feasibility study focused on 6 PAs and
      demonstrated that Fitbit trackers were most accurate when walking on a treadmill 
      and least accurate during walking with a walking aid and for low-intensity
      activities. This may suggest excluding participants with assistive devices from
      studies that focus on PA interventions using commercially available trackers.
      This study also indicates that the wearing site of the tracker is an important
      factor impacting the accuracy performance. A larger scale study with a more
      diverse population, various activity tracker vendors, and a larger activity set
      are warranted to generalize our results.

TI  - Medication Harmony: A Framework to Save Time, Improve Accuracy and Increase
      Patient Activation.
PG  - 1959-66
AB  - Incompletely reconciled medication lists contribute to prescribing errors and
      adverse drug events. Providers expend time and effort at every point of patient
      contact attempting to curate a best possible medication list, and yet often the
      list is incomplete or inaccurate. We propose a framework that builds upon the
      existing infrastructure of a health information exchange (HIE), centralizes data 
      and encourages patient activation. The solution is a constantly accessible,
      singular, patient-adjudicated medication list that incorporates useful
      information and features into the list itself. We aim to decrease medication
      errors across transitions of care, increase awareness of potential drug-drug
      interactions, improve patient knowledge and self-efficacy regarding medications, 
      decrease polypharmacy, improve prescribing safety and ultimately decrease cost to
      the health-care system.

TI  - Where’s the evidence? a systematic review of economic analyses of residential
      aged care infrastructure.
LID - 226
AB  - Background: Residential care infrastructure, in terms of the characteristics of
      the organisation (such as proprietary status, size, and location) and the
      physical environment, have been found to directly influence resident outcomes.
      This review aimed to summarise the existing literature of economic evaluations of
      residential care infrastructure. Methods: A systematic review of English language
      articles using AgeLine, CINAHL, Econlit, Informit (databases in Health; Business 
      and Law; Social Sciences), Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science with
      retrieval up to 14 December 2015. The search strategy combined terms relating to 
      nursing homes, economics, and older people. Full economic evaluations, partial
      economic evaluations, and randomised trials reporting more limited economic
      information, such as estimates of resource use or costs of interventions were
      included. Data was extracted using predefined data fields and synthesized in a
      narrative summary to address the stated review objective. Results: Fourteen
      studies containing an economic component were identified. None of the identified 
      studies attempted to systematically link costs and outcomes in the form of a
      cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, or cost-utility analysis. There was a wide
      variation in approaches taken for valuing the outcomes associated with
      differential residential care infrastructures: 8 studies utilized various
      clinical outcomes as proxies for the quality of care provided, and 2 focused on
      resident outcomes including agitation, quality of life, and the quality of care
      interactions. Only 2 studies included residents living with dementia.
      Conclusions: Robust economic evidence is needed to inform aged care facility
      design. Future research should focus on identifying appropriate and meaningful
      outcome measures that can be used at a service planning level, as well as the
      broader health benefits and cost-saving potential of different organisational and
      environmental characteristics in residential care. Trial registration:

TI  - Urban and transport planning, environmental exposures and health-new concepts,
      methods and tools to improve health in cities.
LID - 38
AB  - Background: The majority of people live in cities and urbanization is continuing 
      worldwide. Cities have long been known to be society’s predominant engine of
      innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution and 
      disease. Methods: We conducted a review around the topic urban and transport
      planning, environmental exposures and health and describe the findings. Results: 
      Within cities there is considerable variation in the levels of environmental
      exposures such as air pollution, noise, temperature and green space. Emerging
      evidence suggests that urban and transport planning indicators such as road
      network, distance to major roads, and traffic density, household density,
      industry and natural and green space explain a large proportion of the
      variability. Personal behavior including mobility adds further variability to
      personal exposures, determines variability in green space and UV exposure, and
      can provide increased levels of physical activity.Air pollution, noise and
      temperature have been associated with adverse health effects including increased 
      morbidity and premature mortality, UV and green space with both positive and
      negative health effects and physical activity with many health benefits. In many 
      cities there is still scope for further improvement in environmental quality
      through targeted policies. Making cities ‘green and healthy’ goes far beyond
      simply reducing CO2 emissions. Environmental factors are highly modifiable, and
      environmental interventions at the community level, such as urban and transport
      planning, have been shown to be promising and more cost effective than
      interventions at the individual level. However, the urban environment is a
      complex interlinked system.Decision-makers need not only better data on the
      complexity of factors in environmental and developmental processes affecting
      human health, but also enhanced understanding of the linkages to be able to know 
      at which level to target their actions. New research tools, methods and paradigms
      such as geographical information systems, smartphones, and other GPS devices,
      small sensors to measure environmental exposures, remote sensing and the exposome
      paradigm together with citizens observatories and science and health impact
      assessment can now provide this information. Conclusion: While in cities there
      are often silos of urban planning, mobility and transport, parks and green space,
      environmental department, (public) health department that do not work together
      well enough, multi-sectorial approaches are needed to tackle the environmental
      problems. The city of the future needs to be a green city, a social city, an
      active city, a healthy city. Electronic supplementary material: The online

TI  - Artificial intelligence-based decision-making for age-related macular
      degeneration.
PG  - 232-45
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has a 
      great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve health care quality. Of
      particular interest is practical implementation of such AI-based software as a
      cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine, the practice of providing medical care
      from a distance using electronic interfaces.Methods: In this study, we used a
      dataset of labeled 35,900 optical coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three
      types of CNNs to perform AMD diagnosis.Results: Here, we present an AI- and
      cloud-based telemedicine interaction tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of
      AMD. Through deep learning process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same
      image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our hospital. The AI 
      platform's detection accuracy was generally higher than 90% and was significantly
      superior (p < 0.001) to that of medical students (69.4% and 68.9%) and equal (p =
      0.99) to that of retinal specialists (92.73% and 91.90%). Furthermore, it
      provided appropriate treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal
      specialists.Conclusions: We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud
      computing based on this AI platform, available at https://www.ym.edu.tw/~AI-OCT/.
      Patients can upload their OCT images to the website to verify whether they have
      AMD and require treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real
      solution for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine.

TI  - Developing a system that can automatically detect health changes using transfer
      times of older adults.
LID - 23
AB  - Background: As gait speed and transfer times are considered to be an important
      measure of functional ability in older adults, several systems are currently
      being researched to measure this parameter in the home environment of older
      adults. The data resulting from these systems, however, still needs to be
      reviewed by healthcare workers which is a time-consuming process. Methods: This
      paper presents a system that employs statistical process control techniques (SPC)
      to automatically detect both positive and negative trends in transfer times.
      Several SPC techniques, Tabular cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart, Standardized CUSUM 
      and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart were evaluated. The best
      performing method was further optimized for the desired application. After this, 
      it was validated on both simulated data and real-life data. Results: The best
      performing method was the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average control chart
      with the use of rational subgroups and a reinitialization after three alarm days.
      The results from the simulated data showed that positive and negative trends are 
      detected within 14 days after the start of the trend when a trend is 28 days
      long. When the transition period is shorter, the number of days before an alert
      is triggered also diminishes. If for instance an abrupt change is present in the 
      transfer time an alert is triggered within two days after this change. On
      average, only one false alarm is triggered every five weeks. The results from the
      real-life dataset confirm those of the simulated dataset. Conclusions: The system
      presented in this paper is able to detect both positive and negative trends in
      the transfer times of older adults, therefore automatically triggering an alarm
      when changes in transfer times occur. These changes can be gradual as well as
      abrupt.

TI  - Teledermatology: Comparison of Store-and-Forward Versus Live Interactive Video
      Conferencing.
LID - e11871
AB  - A decreasing number of dermatologists and an increasing number of patients in
      Western countries have led to a relative lack of clinicians providing expert
      dermatologic care. This, in turn, has prolonged wait times for patients to be
      examined, putting them at risk. Store-and-forward teledermatology improves
      patient access to dermatologists through asynchronous consultations, reducing
      wait times to obtain a consultation. However, live video conferencing as a
      synchronous service is also frequently used by practitioners because it allows
      immediate interaction between patient and physician. This raises the question of 
      which of the two approaches is superior in terms of quality of care and
      convenience. There are pros and cons for each in terms of technical requirements 
      and features. This viewpoint compares the two techniques based on a literature
      review and a clinical perspective to help dermatologists assess the value of
      teledermatology and determine which techniques would be valuable in their
      practice.

TI  - Risk Factors for and Barriers to Control Type-2 Diabetes among Saudi Population.
PG  - 10-9
AB  - Background:: The prevalence of Type-2 Diabetes is dramatically increasing in
      urban areas within Saudi Arabia. Hence, Type-2 Diabetes has now become the most
      common public health problem. Understanding the major risk factors for and
      barriers to control Type-2 Diabetes may lead to strategies to prevent, control,
      and reduce in the burden of disease cases. Objective:: To describe risk factors
      for and barriers to control Type- 2 Diabetes in Saudi Arabia. Methods:: The
      literature search was conducted on risk factors for and barriers to control Type-
      2 Diabetes in Saudi Arabia using the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google
      Scholar (2007-2015). The literature search yielded 80 articles, of which 70
      articles were included in this review after excluding non-relevant articles.
      Results:: The literature review revealed that obesity, physical inactivity,
      unhealthy diet, smoking, and aging are the major risk factors for Type-2 Diabetes
      in Saudi Arabia. Further, the review allocated a complex set of barriers
      including, lack of education, social support, and healthy environment. These
      barriers may hinder Saudis with Type-2 Diabetes from controlling their disease.
      Conclusion:: The prevalence of Type-2 Diabetes is high among the Saudi population
      and represents a major public health problem. Effective research programs are
      needed to address the modifiable risk factors for and barriers to control Type-2 
      Diabetes among Saudi population.

      are.
LID - 2
AB  - When we established an emergency department-based telemedicine program, we
      assumed that many older patients would be skeptical of the new technology and
      choose not to participate. Our assumption was incorrect. Of the 1052 patients we 
      evaluated in the first several months, 355 (33%) were 60, 2 were 99. Satisfaction
      and quality assessment scores among older patients were similar to those for
      younger patients. Many of these older patients demonstrated flexibility and
      interest in the novel use of technology. Our emergency department-based
      telemedicine program resulted in safe and satisfactory care and was readily
      accepted by our older patients.

TI  - Generalized Linear Models of Home Activity for Automatic Detection of Mild
      Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults*.
PG  - 680-3
AB  - With a globally aging population, the burden of care of cognitively impaired
      older adults is becoming increasingly concerning. Instances of Alzheimer’s
      disease and other forms of dementia are becoming ever more frequent. Earlier
      detection of cognitive impairment offers significant benefits, but remains
      difficult to do in practice. In this paper, we develop statistical models of the 
      behavior of older adults within their homes using sensor data in order to detect 
      the early onset of cognitive decline. Specifically, we use inhomogenous Poisson
      processes to model the presence of subjects within different rooms throughout the
      day in the home using unobtrusive sensing technologies. We compare the
      distributions learned from cognitively intact and impaired subjects using
      information theoretic tools and observe statistical differences between the two
      populations which we believe can be used to help detect the onset of cognitive
      decline.

PG  - 17-23
AB  - Technology in the home environment has the potential to support older adults in a
      variety of ways. We took an interdisciplinary approach (human factors/ergonomics 
      and computer science) to develop a technology “coach” that could support older
      adults in learning to use a medical device. Our system provided a computer vision
      system to track the use of a blood glucose meter and provide users with feedback 
      if they made an error. This research could support the development of an in-home 
      personal assistant to coach individuals in a variety of tasks necessary for
      independent living.

PG  - i180-90
AB  - Objectives.To describe a longitudinal community cohort study, Intelligent Systems
      for Assessing Aging Changes, that has deployed an unobtrusive home-based
      assessment platform in many seniors homes in the existing community.
      Methods.Several types of sensors have been installed in the homes of 265 elderly 
      persons for an average of 33 months. Metrics assessed by the sensors include
      total daily activity, time out of home, and walking speed. Participants were
      given a computer as well as training, and computer usage was monitored.
      Participants are assessed annually with health and function questionnaires,
      physical examinations, and neuropsychological testing. Results.Mean age was 83.3 
      years, mean years of education was 15.5, and 73% of cohort were women. During a
      4-week snapshot, participants left their home twice a day on average for a total 
      of 208 min per day. Mean in-home walking speed was 61.0 cm/s. Participants spent 
      43% of days on the computer averaging 76 min per day. Discussion.These results
      demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of engaging seniors in a
      large-scale deployment of in-home activity assessment technology and the
      successful collection of these activity metrics. We plan to use this platform to 
      determine if continuous unobtrusive monitoring may detect incident cognitive
      decline.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Clinician and Staff Views on the Acceptability of
      Incorporating Remote Monitoring Technology into Primary Care.
PG  - 428-38
AB  - Objective:Remote monitoring technology (RMT) may enhance healthcare quality and
      reduce costs. RMT adoption depends on perceptions of the end-user (e.g.,
      patients, caregivers, healthcare providers). We conducted a systematic review
      exploring the acceptability and feasibility of RMT use in routine adult patient
      care, from the perspectives of primary care clinicians, administrators, and
      clinic staff.Materials and Methods:We searched the databases of Medline, IEEE
      Xplore, and Compendex for original articles published from January 1996 through
      February 2013. We manually screened bibliographies of pertinent studies and
      consulted experts to identify English-language studies meeting our inclusion
      criteria.Results:Of 939 citations identified, 15 studies reported in 16
      publications met inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous by country, type 
      of RMT used, patient and provider characteristics, and method of implementation
      and evaluation. Clinicians, staff, and administrators generally held positive
      views about RMTs. Concerns emerged regarding clinical relevance of RMT data,
      changing clinical roles and patterns of care (e.g., reduced quality of care from 
      fewer patient visits, overtreatment), insufficient staffing or time to monitor
      and discuss RMT data, data incompatibility with a clinic's electronic health
      record (EHR), and unclear legal liability regarding response
      protocols.Conclusions:This small body of heterogeneous literature suggests that
      for RMTs to be adopted in primary care, researchers and developers must ensure
      clinical relevance, support adequate infrastructure, streamline data transmission
      into EHR systems, attend to changing care patterns and professional roles, and
      clarify response protocols. There is a critical need to engage end-users in the
      development and implementation of RMT.

TI  - Using diffusion of innovation theory to describe perceptions of a passive
      positioning alarm among persons with mild dementia: a repeated interview study.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Problems with memory and decline in cognitive abilities are common
      during development of dementia. Different kinds of technologies may be useful in 
      supporting persons with dementia and their relatives in daily life. Tracking
      technologies have the potential to improve independence among persons with
      dementia. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to describe perceptions 
      of a passive positioning alarm (PPA) among persons with mild dementia. Methods: A
      repeated interview study was conducted in Sweden with a strategic sample of 11
      persons with mild dementia. Roger’s Diffusion of Innovation Theory was used to
      deductively analyse the data. Results: Regarding the advantages of the PPA,
      participants described perceived safety and security for, both themselves, and
      their relatives, as well as freedom and independence. However, they also
      expressed concern about the cost of the PPA, reflected on who might be the
      receiver of the alarm from the PPA, emphasized the importance of opportunities to
      test the device before becoming a user and early introduction before their
      problems start, thus allowing them to decide for themselves. Conclusions:
      Supporting persons with dementia in their own homes using, e.g., a PPA may enable
      them and their relatives to remain longer in their own homes and be safer in
      their own neighbourhoods.

TI  - Views of Caregivers on the Ethics of Assistive Technology Used for Home
      Surveillance of People Living with Dementia.
PG  - 255-66
AB  - This paper examines the ethics of using assistive technology such as video
      surveillance in the homes of people living with dementia. Ideation and concept
      elaboration around the introduction of a camera-based surveillance service in the
      homes of people with dementia, typically living alone, is explored. The paper
      reviews relevant literature on surveillance of people living with dementia, and
      summarises the findings from ideation and concept elaboration workshops, designed
      to capture the views of those involved in the care of people living with dementia
      at home. The research question relates to the ethical considerations of using
      assistive technologies that include video surveillance in the homes of people
      living with dementia, and the implications for a person living with dementia
      whenever video surveillance is used in their home and access to the camera is
      given to the person’s family. The review of related work indicated that such
      video surveillance may result in loss of autonomy or freedom for the person with 
      dementia. The workshops reflected the findings from the related work, and
      revealed useful information to inform the service design, in particular in
      fine-tuning the service to find the best relationship between privacy and
      usefulness. Those who took part in the workshops supported the concept of the use
      of camera in the homes of people living with dementia, with some significant
      caveats around privacy. The research carried out in this work is small in scale
      but points towards an acceptance by many caregivers of people living with
      dementia of surveillance technologies. This paper indicates that those who care
      for people living with dementia at home are willing to make use of camera
      technology and therefore the value of this work is to help shed light on the
      direction for future research.

TI  - Task-Data Taxonomy for Health Data Visualizations: Web-Based Survey With Experts 
      and Older Adults.
LID - e39
AB  - Background: Increasingly, eHealth involves health data visualizations to enable
      users to better understand their health situation. Selecting efficient and
      ergonomic visualizations requires knowledge about the task that the user wants to
      carry out and the type of data to be displayed. Taxonomies of abstract tasks and 
      data types bundle this knowledge in a general manner. Task-data taxonomies exist 
      for visualization tasks and data. They also exist for eHealth tasks. However,
      there is currently no joint task taxonomy available for health data
      visualizations incorporating the perspective of the prospective users. One of the
      most prominent prospective user groups of eHealth are older adults, but their
      perspective is rarely considered when constructing tasks lists. Objective: The
      aim of this study was to construct a task-data taxonomy for health data
      visualizations based on the opinion of older adults as prospective users of
      eHealth systems. eHealth experts served as a control group against the bias of
      lacking background knowledge. The resulting taxonomy would then be used as an
      orientation in system requirement analysis and empirical evaluation and to
      facilitate a common understanding and language in eHealth data visualization.
      Methods: Answers from 98 participants (51 older adults and 47 eHealth experts)
      given in an online survey were quantitatively analyzed, compared between groups, 
      and synthesized into a task-data taxonomy for health data visualizations.
      Results: Consultation, diagnosis, mentoring, and monitoring were confirmed as
      relevant abstract tasks in eHealth. Experts and older adults disagreed on the
      importance of mentoring (χ24=14.1, P=.002) and monitoring (χ24=22.1, P<.001). The
      answers to the open questions validated the findings from the closed questions
      and added therapy, communication, cooperation, and quality management to the
      aforementioned tasks. Here, group differences in normalized code counts were
      identified for “monitoring” between the expert group (mean 0.18, SD 0.23) and the
      group of older adults (mean 0.08, SD 0.15; t96=2431, P=.02). Time-dependent data 
      was most relevant across all eHealth tasks. Finally, visualization tasks and data
      types were assigned to eHealth tasks by both experimental groups. Conclusions: We
      empirically developed a task-data taxonomy for health data visualizations with
      prospective users. This provides a general framework for theoretical concession
      and for the prioritization of user-centered system design and evaluation. At the 
      same time, the functionality dimension of the taxonomy for telemedicine—chosen as
      the basis for the construction of present taxonomy—was confirmed.

TI  - Integrated Telehealth and Telecare for Monitoring Frail Elderly with Chronic
      Disease.
PG  - 940-57
AB  - Objective:To investigate the potential of an integrated care system that acquires
      vital clinical signs and habits data to support independent living for elderly
      people with chronic disease.Materials and Methods:We developed an IEEE 11073
      standards-based telemonitoring platform for monitoring vital signs and activity
      data of elderly living alone in their home. The platform has important features
      for monitoring the elderly: unobtrusive, simple, elderly-friendly, plug and play 
      interoperable, and self-integration of sensors. Thirty-six (36) patients in a
      primary care practice in the United Kingdom (mean [standard deviation] age, 82
      [10] years) with congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD) were provided with clinical sensors to measure the vital signs for
      their disease (blood pressure [BP] and weight for CHF, and oxygen saturation for 
      COPD) and one passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor and/or a chair/bed sensor were
      installed in a patient's home to obtain their activity data. The patients were
      asked to take one measurement each day of their vital signs in the morning before
      breakfast. All data were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the remote
      server and displayed on a clinical portal for clinicians to monitor each patient.
      An alert algorithm detected outliers in the data and indicated alerts on the
      portal. Patient data have been analyzed retrospectively following hospital
      admission, emergency room visit or death, to determine whether the data could
      predict the event.Results:Data of patients who were monitored for a long period
      and had interventions were analyzed to identify useful parameters and develop
      algorithms to define alert rules. Twenty of the 36 participants had a clinical
      referral during the time of monitoring; 16 of them received some type of
      intervention. The most common reason for intervention was due to low oxygen
      levels for patients with COPD and high BP levels for CHF. Activity data were
      found to contain information on the well-being of patients, in particular for
      those with COPD. During exacerbation the activity level from PIR sensors
      increased slightly, and there was a decrease in bed occupancy. One subject with
      CHF who felt unwell spent most of the day in the bedroom.Conclusions:Our results 
      suggest that integrated care monitoring technologies have a potential for
      providing improved care and can have positive impact on well-being of the elderly
      by enabling timely intervention. Long-term BP and pulse oximetry data could
      indicate exacerbation and lead to effective intervention; physical activity data 
      provided important information on the well-being of patients. However, there
      remains a need for better understanding of long-term variations in vital signs
      and activity data to establish intervention protocols for improved disease
      management.

      Bound-Constrained Optimization Algorithm.
LID - 2254
AB  - In this study, a bound-constrained optimization algorithm is applied for
      estimating physiological data (pulse and breathing rate) of human body using 60
      GHz Doppler radar, by detecting displacements induced by breathing and the
      heartbeat of a human subject. The influence of mutual phasing between the two
      movements is analyzed in a theoretical framework and the application of
      optimization algorithms is proved to be able to accurately detect both breathing 
      and heartbeat rates, despite intermodulation effects between them. Different
      optimization procedures are compared and shown to be more robust to receiver
      noise and artifacts of random body motion than a direct spectrum analysis. In
      case of a large-scale constrained bound, a parallel optimization procedure
      executed in subranges is proposed to realize accurate detection in a reduced span
      of time.

PG  - 335-46
AB  - Objective: This study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of a robotic fall 
      prevention program on knowledge, exercises, balance, and incidence of falls among
      elderly in senior housings. Patients and methods: This is a quasi-experimental
      study. Sixty-four elderly in two senior housings in Bangkok with Barthel Index
      scale ≥12, who had either at least one fall experience in the past 12 months
      and/or had Timed Up and Go (TUG) test ≥20 seconds were recruited and purposively 
      assigned to the intervention group (received a small robot-installed fall
      prevention software, personal coaching, and handbook, n=32) and control group
      (received only handbook, n=32). Outcomes were knowledge score evaluated by
      structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews, number of exercises
      measured by self-recorded diary, and balance score assessed by TUG and Berg
      Balance Scale (BBS). The incidence of falls was assessed by face-to-face
      interviews. Both groups were assessed at baseline, 3rd, and 6th month after the
      intervention. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in
      knowledge mean score at 6th month in both the groups. However, the intervention
      group showed faster increase in knowledge mean score than the control group at
      3rd month (P<0.01). The intervention group showed a statistically significant
      higher number of exercises than the control group at 3rd and 6th month (P<0.05). 
      There was no statistically significant difference on TUG and BBS mean scores
      between the two groups at baseline, 3rd, and 6th month. However, the intervention
      group showed a statistically significant improvement in TUG and BBS at 6th month 
      post-intervention (P<0.01). There was one fall reported in the control group.
      Conclusion: The robotic fall prevention program increased knowledge on fall
      prevention and promoted exercises and balance among elderly in senior housings.

TI  - Evaluation of Health Alerts from an Early Illness Warning System in Independent
      Living.
PG  - 274-80
AB  - Passive sensor networks were deployed in independent living apartments to monitor
      older adults in their home environments to detect signs of impending illness and 
      alert clinicians so they can intervene and prevent or delay significant changes
      in health or functional status. A retrospective qualitative deductive content
      analysis was undertaken to refine health alerts to improve clinical relevance to 
      clinicians as they use alerts in their normal work flow of routine care delivery 
      to older adults. Clinicians completed written free-text boxes to describe actions
      taken (or not) as a result of each alert; they also rated the clinical
      significance (relevance) of each health alert on a scale of 1–5. Two samples of
      the clinician’s written responses to the health alerts were analyzed after alert 
      algorithms had been adjusted based on results of a pilot study using health
      alerts to enhance clinical decision-making.In the first sample, a total of 663
      comments were generated by seven clinicians in response to 385 unique alerts;
      there are more comments than alerts because more than one clinician rated the
      same alert. The second sample had a total of 142 comments produced by three
      clinicians in response to 88 distinct alerts. Overall clinical relevance of the
      alerts, as judged by the content of the qualitative comments by clinicians for
      each alert, improved from 33.3% of the alerts in the first sample classified as
      clinically relevant to 43.2% in the second. The goal is to produce clinically
      relevant alerts that clinicians find useful in daily practice. The evaluation
      methods used are described to assist others as they consider building and
      iteratively refining health alerts to enhance clinical decision-making.

TI  - Assessment of sex analysis in studies of technology-based interventions to
      alleviate caregiver burden among caregivers of persons with dementia.
LID - 2055668318775313
AB  - Background: With an increase in the number of family caregivers for persons with 
      dementia, caregiver burden is a major concern. Defined as computer-based devices 
      and programs, technology has been identified as an intervention to address this
      issue. However, to date, there is little consideration of sex differences among
      caregivers in the design and planning of these interventions. Objective: To
      systematically review the literature on technology-based interventions for
      caregivers of persons with dementia and report the frequency and approaches of
      sex-based analysis. Methods: The literature was systematically searched for
      reviews of technology-based interventions for caregivers of persons with
      dementia. All titles and abstracts of publications included in the retrieved
      reviews were screened using pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full
      text articles that met the inclusion criteria were included for analysis.
      Results: Four reviews were identified and 19 articles representing 17 studies
      were retrieved. Among these studies, only four examined outcomes by sex. In the
      studies that examined outcomes by sex, three reported significant differences
      (p < 0.05) between male and female caregivers. Conclusions: There is currently a 
      lack of (1) sex-based analyses, (2) inclusion of males and (3) provision of
      sex-specific information in studies of technology-based interventions for
      caregivers of persons with dementia.

PG  - 234-42
AB  - Digital technology is transforming the development of drugs for Alzheimer's
      disease and was the topic of the Alzheimer's Association's Research Roundtable on
      its May 23–24, 2017 meeting. Research indicates that wearable devices and
      unobtrusive passive sensors that enable the collection of frequent or continuous,
      objective, and multidimensional data during daily activities may capture subtle
      changes in cognition and functional capacity long before the onset of dementia.
      The potential to exploit these technologies to improve clinical trials as both
      recruitment and retention tools as well as for potential end points was
      discussed. The implications for the collection and use of large amounts of data, 
      lessons learned from other related disease areas, ethical concerns raised by
      these new technologies, and regulatory issues were also covered in the meeting.
      Finally, the challenges and opportunities of these new technologies for future
      use were discussed.

TI  - Gains in cognition through combined cognitive and physical training: the role of 
      training dosage and severity of neurocognitive disorder.
LID - 152
AB  - Physical as well as cognitive training interventions improve specific cognitive
      functions but effects barely generalize on global cognition. Combined physical
      and cognitive training may overcome this shortcoming as physical training may
      facilitate the neuroplastic potential which, in turn, may be guided by cognitive 
      training. This study aimed at investigating the benefits of combined training on 
      global cognition while assessing the effect of training dosage and exploring the 
      role of several potential effect modifiers. In this multi-center study, 322 older
      adults with or without neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) were allocated to a
      computerized, game-based, combined physical and cognitive training group (n =
      237) or a passive control group (n = 85). Training group participants were
      allocated to different training dosages ranging from 24 to 110 potential
      sessions. In a pre-post-test design, global cognition was assessed by averaging
      standardized performance in working memory, episodic memory and executive
      function tests. The intervention group increased in global cognition compared to 
      the control group, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.31. Exploratory analysis revealed a
      trend for less benefits in participants with more severe NCD, p = 0.08
      (cognitively healthy: d = 0.54; mild cognitive impairment: d = 0.19; dementia: d 
      = 0.04). In participants without dementia, we found a dose-response effect of the
      potential number and of the completed number of training sessions on global
      cognition, p = 0.008 and p = 0.04, respectively. The results indicate that
      combined physical and cognitive training improves global cognition in a
      dose-responsive manner but these benefits may be less pronounced in older adults 
      with more severe NCD. The long-lasting impact of combined training on the
      incidence and trajectory of NCDs in relation to its severity should be assessed
      in future long-term trials.

TI  - Cognitive Assessment of Patients With Alzheimer's Disease by Telemedicine: Pilot 
      Study.
LID - e31
AB  - Background: Approximately 46.8 million people are living with dementia worldwide 
      and their number will grow in the next years. Any potential treatment should be
      administered as early as possible because it is important to provide an early
      cognitive assessment and to regularly monitor the mental function of patients.
      Information and communication technologies can be helpful to reach and follow
      patients without displacing them, but there may be doubts about the reliability
      of cognitive tests performed by telemedicine. Objective: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the reliability of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
      and the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) tests 
      administered in hospital by videoconference to patients with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The tests were administered to 28 Alzheimer's
      disease outpatients (8 male, mean age 73.88, SD 7.45 years; 20 female mean age
      76.00, SD 5.40 years) recruited and followed in the Alzheimer’s Unit of the A
      Cardarelli National Hospital (Naples, Italy) at baseline and after 6, 12, 18, and
      24 months of observation. Patients were evaluated first face-to-face by a
      psychologist and then, after 2 weeks, by another psychologist via videoconference
      in hospital. Results: This study showed no differences in the MMSE and ADAS-cog
      scores when the tests were administered face-to-face or by videoconference,
      except in patients with more pronounced cognitive deficits (MMSE<17), in which
      the assessment via videoconference overestimated the cognitive impairment (face
      to face, MMSE mean 13.9, SD 4.9 and ADAS-cog mean 9.0, SD 3.8; videoconference,
      MMSE mean 42.8, SD 12.5 and ADAS-cog mean 56.9, SD 5.5). Conclusions: We found
      that videoconferencing is a reliable approach to document cognitive stability or 
      decline, and to measure treatment effects in patients with mild to moderate
      dementia. A more extended study is needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Automated Fall Detection With Quality Improvement “Rewind” to Reduce Falls in
      Hospital Rooms.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the implementation of a fall detection and 
      “rewind” privacy-protecting technique using the Microsoft® Kinect™ to not only
      detect but prevent falls from occurring in hospitalized patients. Kinect sensors 
      were placed in six hospital rooms in a step-down unit and data were continuously 
      logged. Prior to implementation with patients, three researchers performed a
      total of 18 falls (walking and then falling down or falling from the bed) and 17 
      non-fall events (crouching down, stooping down to tie shoe laces, and lying on
      the floor). All falls and non-falls were correctly identified using automated
      algorithms to process Kinect sensor data. During the first 8 months of data
      collection, processing methods were perfected to manage data and provide a
      “rewind” method to view events that led to falls for post-fall quality
      improvement process analyses. Preliminary data from this feasibility study show
      that using the Microsoft Kinect sensors provides detection of falls, fall risks, 
      and facilitates quality improvement after falls in real hospital environments
      unobtrusively, while taking into account patient privacy.

TI  - A Telemetry System Embedded in Clothes for Indoor Localization and Elderly Health
      Monitoring.
PG  - 11728-49
AB  - This paper presents a telemetry system used in a combined trilateration method
      for the precise indoor localization of the elderly who need health monitoring.
      The system is based on the association of two wireless technologies: ultrasonic
      and 802.15.4. The use of the 802.15.4 RF signal gives the reference starting time
      of the ultrasonic emission (time difference of arrival method). A time of flight 
      measurement of the ultrasonic pulses provides the distances between the mobile
      node and three anchor points. These distance measurements are then used to locate
      the mobile node using the trilateration method with an accuracy of a few
      centimetres. The originality of our work lies in embedding the mobile node in
      clothes. The system is embedded in clothes in two ways: on a shoe in order to
      form a “smart” shoe and in a hat in order to form a “smart” hat. Both accessories
      allow movements, gait speed and distance covered to be monitored for health
      applications. Experiments in a test room are presented to show the effectiveness 
      of our system.

TI  - Using Passive Sensing to Estimate Relative Energy Expenditure for Eldercare
      Monitoring.
PG  - 642-8
AB  - This paper describes ongoing work in analyzing sensor data logged in the homes of
      seniors. An estimation of relative energy expenditure is computed using motion
      density from passive infrared motion sensors mounted in the environment. We
      introduce a new algorithm for detecting visitors in the home using motion sensor 
      data and a set of fuzzy rules. The visitor algorithm, as well as a previous
      algorithm for identifying time-away-from-home (TAFH), are used to filter the
      logged motion sensor data. Thus, the energy expenditure estimate uses data
      collected only when the resident is home alone. Case studies are included from
      TigerPlace, an Aging in Place community, to illustrate how the relative energy
      expenditure estimate can be used to track health conditions over time.

TI  - Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Advances: A Review of
      Configurations for Individuals with a Speech Disability.
LID - 1911
AB  - High-tech augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods are on a
      constant rise; however, the interaction between the user and the assistive
      technology is still challenged for an optimal user experience centered around the
      desired activity. This review presents a range of signal sensing and acquisition 
      methods utilized in conjunction with the existing high-tech AAC platforms for
      individuals with a speech disability, including imaging methods, touch-enabled
      systems, mechanical and electro-mechanical access, breath-activated methods, and 
      brain–computer interfaces (BCI). The listed AAC sensing modalities are compared
      in terms of ease of access, affordability, complexity, portability, and typical
      conversational speeds. A revelation of the associated AAC signal processing,
      encoding, and retrieval highlights the roles of machine learning (ML) and deep
      learning (DL) in the development of intelligent AAC solutions. The demands and
      the affordability of most systems hinder the scale of usage of high-tech AAC.
      Further research is indeed needed for the development of intelligent AAC
      applications reducing the associated costs and enhancing the portability of the
      solutions for a real user’s environment. The consolidation of natural language
      processing with current solutions also needs to be further explored for the
      amelioration of the conversational speeds. The recommendations for prospective
      advances in coming high-tech AAC are addressed in terms of developments to
      support mobile health communicative applications.

TI  - Location-Enhanced Activity Recognition in Indoor Environments Using Off the Shelf
      Smart Watch Technology and BLE Beacons.
LID - 1230
AB  - Activity recognition in indoor spaces benefits context awareness and improves the
      efficiency of applications related to personalised health monitoring, building
      energy management, security and safety. The majority of activity recognition
      frameworks, however, employ a network of specialised building sensors or a
      network of body-worn sensors. As this approach suffers with respect to
      practicality, we propose the use of commercial off-the-shelf devices. In this
      work, we design and evaluate an activity recognition system composed of a smart
      watch, which is enhanced with location information coming from Bluetooth Low
      Energy (BLE) beacons. We evaluate the performance of this approach for a variety 
      of activities performed in an indoor laboratory environment, using four
      supervised machine learning algorithms. Our experimental results indicate that
      our location-enhanced activity recognition system is able to reach a
      classification accuracy ranging from 92% to 100%, while without location
      information classification accuracy it can drop to as low as 50% in some cases,
      depending on the window size chosen for data segmentation.

TI  - Systematic review of Kinect applications in elderly care and stroke
      rehabilitation.
PG  - 108
AB  - : In this paper we present a review of the most current avenues of research into 
      Kinect-based elderly care and stroke rehabilitation systems to provide an
      overview of the state of the art, limitations, and issues of concern as well as
      suggestions for future work in this direction. The central purpose of this review
      was to collect all relevant study information into one place in order to support 
      and guide current research as well as inform researchers planning to embark on
      similar studies or applications. The paper is structured into three main
      sections, each one presenting a review of the literature for a specific topic.
      Elderly Care section is comprised of two subsections: Fall detection and Fall
      risk reduction. Stroke Rehabilitation section contains studies grouped under
      Evaluation of Kinect’s spatial accuracy, and Kinect-based rehabilitation methods.
      The third section, Serious and exercise games, contains studies that are
      indirectly related to the first two sections and present a complete system for
      elderly care or stroke rehabilitation in a Kinect-based game format. Each of the 
      three main sections conclude with a discussion of limitations of Kinect in its
      respective applications. The paper concludes with overall remarks regarding use
      of Kinect in elderly care and stroke rehabilitation applications and suggestions 
      for future work. A concise summary with significant findings and subject
      demographics (when applicable) of each study included in the review is also
      provided in table format.

TI  - Intelligent Assistive Technology Applications to Dementia Care: Current
      Capabilities, Limitations, and Future Challenges.
PG  - 88-104
AB  - The number of older Americans afflicted by Alzheimer disease and related
      dementias will triple to 13 million persons by 2050, thus greatly increasing
      healthcare needs. An approach to this emerging crisis is the development and
      deployment of intelligent assistive technologies that compensate for the specific
      physical and cognitive deficits of older adults with dementia, and thereby also
      reduce caregiver burden. The authors conducted an extensive search of the
      computer science, engineering, and medical databases to review intelligent
      cognitive devices, physiologic and environmental sensors, and advanced integrated
      sensor networks that may find future applications in dementia care. Review of the
      extant literature reveals an overwhelming focus on the physical disability of
      younger persons with typically nonprogressive anoxic and traumatic brain
      injuries, with few clinical studies specifically involving persons with dementia.
      A discussion of the specific capabilities, strengths, and limitations of each
      technology is followed by an overview of research methodological challenges that 
      must be addressed to achieve measurable progress to meet the healthcare needs of 
      an aging America.

TI  - New Fast Fall Detection Method Based on Spatio-Temporal Context Tracking of Head 
      by Using Depth Images.
PG  - 23004-19
AB  - In order to deal with the problem of projection occurring in fall detection with 
      two-dimensional (2D) grey or color images, this paper proposed a robust fall
      detection method based on spatio-temporal context tracking over three-dimensional
      (3D) depth images that are captured by the Kinect sensor. In the pre-processing
      procedure, the parameters of the Single-Gauss-Model (SGM) are estimated and the
      coefficients of the floor plane equation are extracted from the background
      images. Once human subject appears in the scene, the silhouette is extracted by
      SGM and the foreground coefficient of ellipses is used to determine the head
      position. The dense spatio-temporal context (STC) algorithm is then applied to
      track the head position and the distance from the head to floor plane is
      calculated in every following frame of the depth image. When the distance is
      lower than an adaptive threshold, the centroid height of the human will be used
      as the second judgment criteria to decide whether a fall incident happened.
      Lastly, four groups of experiments with different falling directions are
      performed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect fall
      incidents that occurred in different orientations, and they only need a low
      computation complexity.

TI  - A Review of Accelerometry-Based Wearable Motion Detectors for Physical Activity
      Monitoring.
PG  - 7772-88
AB  - Characteristics of physical activity are indicative of one’s mobility level,
      latent chronic diseases and aging process. Accelerometers have been widely
      accepted as useful and practical sensors for wearable devices to measure and
      assess physical activity. This paper reviews the development of wearable
      accelerometry-based motion detectors. The principle of accelerometry measurement,
      sensor properties and sensor placements are first introduced. Various research
      using accelerometry-based wearable motion detectors for physical activity
      monitoring and assessment, including posture and movement classification,
      estimation of energy expenditure, fall detection and balance control evaluation, 
      are also reviewed. Finally this paper reviews and compares existing commercial
      products to provide a comprehensive outlook of current development status and
      possible emerging technologies.
