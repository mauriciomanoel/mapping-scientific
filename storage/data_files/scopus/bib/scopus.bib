abstract={Modeling Cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a challenging step that requires a lot of background from both the cyber and physical fields. However, there is a lack of studies in the existing literature that discuss the state of the art in modeling CPS or explore the research gaps in this area. In this paper, we survey existing approaches to modeling CPS. We focus on studying the considered CPS properties. Based on this study, we classify these properties and discuss their importance in different application domains. Moreover, research directions are presented to address key challenges in the specification of CPS models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Software system evolution is an active and important research topic in software engineering. In guiding software system evolution, software architecture plays a critical role. In the traditional software architecture, only the link information of components is considered, while the place information of components is usually neglected. However, due to the emerging mobile computing, pervasive computing, and intelligent computing, the place information is as important as the link information in the software architecture. Especially in mobile computing environments, the place changes often lead to changes in software configuration and functionality. In this paper, we study the Bigraph specification of software architecture and use it to describe both link and place information in detail. Based on Bigraph specification, we investigate the structural characteristics in the software architecture, and design checking algorithms for the component's link exceptions and place exceptions. Furthermore, we address the well-evolved software architecture from a new perspective, which includes three basic evolution operation rules and their well-evolved conditions. We discuss the overall software architecture evolution through strong and weak bi-simulation in terms of software functionality. Finally, two case studies about software system in the evolution operation are presented, which illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In general, a system may be subject to a combination of functional requirements (FRs) that dictate behavior and non-functional requirements (NFRs) that characterize how FRs are to be satisfied. NFRs also introduce cross-cutting concerns that may be difficult to predict, where the degree of satisfaction (i.e., satisficement) of one NFR may be impacted by the satisficement of one or more FRs/NFRs. In particular, self-adaptive systems (SASs) can modify system configurations or behaviors at run time to continuously satisfy FRs and NFRs. This paper presents Providentia, a search-based technique to optimize the satisficement of NFRs in an SAS experiencing various sources of uncertainty. Providentia explores different combinations of weighted FRs to maximize NFR/FR satisficement. Experimental results suggest that Providentia-optimized goal models significantly improve the satisficement of an SAS when compared with manually- and randomly-generated weights and subgoals. Additionally, we apply a hyper-heuristic (Providentia-SAW) to balance the contribution of NFRs, FRs, and the number of adaptations and further improve the Providentia technique. We apply Providentia and Providentia-SAW to two case studies in different application domains involving a remote data mirroring network and a robotic vacuum controller, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a scale for the evaluation of the perceived quality of services provided to students with disabilities by Special Vocational Education (SVE) institutions in Greece. Design/methodology/approach: SVE service quality was approached on the basis of the performance-only model. The participatory research paradigm was followed, engaging students with disability and specifically with intellectual disability in several stages of the instrument development. The methodological design included two phases for the establishment and testing of the reliability and validity of the scale. Findings: The findings of the study support a multifactorial construct of SVE service quality consisting of five factors: responsiveness, surroundings, personalization, training and facilities adequacy. Research limitations/implications: Generalization of results should be attempted with concern. The type and severity of disability should be considered in future use of the scale. The construct of training for students with disability needs to be further investigated. Practical implications: SVE-Service-Quality Scale may be used in SVE settings highlighting areas of improvement or as an instrument for the assessment of implemented interventions. Social implications: Participatory research may serve as an empowerment opportunity for students with disability, whose active engagement in the research design allows for a small-scale yet valuable social impact, promoting emancipation for people with disability. Originality/value: The study draws attention on the field of SVE service quality where research is scarce, introducing SVE in the discussion about educational service quality assessment. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Caring for older adults is an increasingly complex and multi-dimensional global concern. This article provides a comprehensive definition of the older adult care experience and discusses its key components to help practitioners deliver older adult-centered care to maximize well-being outcomes for older adults. Design/methodology/approach: Based on prior research on service operations, service experience, person-centered care and the unique, evolving needs of older adults regarding their care, this paper develops a conceptual framework in which the older adult care experience is the central construct, and key dimensions of well-being are the outcomes. Findings: The older adult care experience is shaped by older adults' perceptions and evaluations of the care that they receive. Older adult-centered care has autonomy, dignity, unique needs and social environment as its core dimensions and results in those older adults feel empowered, respected, engaged and connected as part of their experience. The article also discusses how such experience can be evaluated by using quality dimensions from service operations, hospitality and healthcare contexts, and challenges that service firms may face in creating older adult care experience. Research limitations/implications: Given the changing demographics and unique needs of older adults, it is an imperative for academics and practitioners to have an understanding of what determines older adult care experience to better serve them. Such understanding is important as by creating and fostering older adult care experience, service organizations can contribute to individual and societal well-being. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a comprehensive conceptualization of the older adult care experience. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Smart PSS (product-service system) has been transcending the scope of traditional PSS through ICTs (information and communication technologies). The co-implementation is a specific way of co-creation to generate value for customer and supplier in smart PSS. Meanwhile, the service failures in co-implementation can bring about service paradox. As such, three key research questions, including the construction of co-implementation of smart PSS, the extension of risk factors in FMECA and the category of identified failure modes, are put forward and conquered by a proposed methodological framework. First, in order to construct the co-implementation of smart PSS involving customer and supplier, the PCN (process-chain-network) diagram with direct interaction, surrogate interaction and independent handling is employed to reflect the nature of interaction. Second, since that the highly complexity of co-implementation of smart PSS can lead to more huge risk, an extended-FMECA (failure mode effect and criticality analysis) sheet is formulated by considering the adaptation of autonomy. Third, to handle the uncertainty of expert judgments more reasonably and determine the weights of risk factors without additional information, a hybrid approach integrating rough-entropy-ELECTRE TRI is proposed to classify failure modes into ordinal classes, so that decision-makers can swiftly access them. This proposed methodological framework also is illustrated by the co-implementation of smart fridge-service system, in which the feasibility and superiority are verified by analysing comparative results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Software architecture records key decisions about software systems. Changes to architecture decisions can, therefore, have significant costs. One of the main causes of architecture changes is uncertainty, which is an inherent feature in open, real-world software systems. We hypothesise that capturing uncertainties, as far as they can be predicted, pertaining to structure, behaviour and resources of systems in software architecture and treating them as first-class concerns, would make architecture decisions more resilient to change. Explicitly considering and representing uncertainty in architecture can help developers design for change and minimise architecture erosion as changes invariably occur. In this PhD project, we aim to develop a conceptual framework for the management of uncertainty in software architecture. The conceptual framework will be realised in the form of a workbench of tools for managing uncertainty at the architectural level. The effectiveness of the framework and the workbench will be evaluated using case studies. An ideal case study for evaluation will demonstrate different aspects of uncertainty in software architecture. Potential domains under consideration for case studies include wireless sensor networks and health care systems. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={Smart manufacturing has received increased attention from academia and industry in recent years, as it provides competitive advantage for manufacturing companies making industry more efficient and sustainable. As one of the most important technologies for smart manufacturing, big data analytics can uncover hidden knowledge and other useful information like relations between lifecycle decisions and process parameters helping industrial leaders to make more-informed business decisions in complex management environments. However, according to the literature, big data analytics and smart manufacturing were individually researched in academia and industry. To provide theoretical foundations for the research community to further develop scientific insights in applying big data analytics to smart manufacturing, it is necessary to summarize the existing research progress and weakness. In this paper, through combining the key technologies of smart manufacturing and the idea of ubiquitous servitization in the whole lifecycle, the term of sustainable smart manufacturing was coined. A comprehensive overview of big data in smart manufacturing was conducted, and a conceptual framework was proposed from the perspective of product lifecycle. The proposed framework allows analyzing potential applications and key advantages, and the discussion of current challenges and future research directions provides valuable insights for academia and industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Individuals with disabilities experience difficulty in using various everyday technologies such as computers and smartphones. Objectives: To propose a conceptual framework that will lead to the development of practical and user friendly assistive technology. Method: A literature review of challenges faced by individuals with physical disabilities was carried out. Interviews with adults with physical disabilities in Kampala, Uganda, and Port Elizabeth, South Africa, identified three main challenges with regard to using technology: using a mobile phone, controlling an electronic environment and using a computer. Results: The challenges identified can be solved by taking into consideration the needs of individuals with disabilities. However, the design of new technologies and interaction techniques, such as natural hand gestures and voice, as input mechanisms has able-bodied individuals in mind. Individuals with disabilities are considered as an afterthought. The main reason for this is that individuals with a disability are a minority and hence it may not make economic sense for technology innovators to cater for their unique needs. A lack of practical guidelines on how to design for individuals with disabilities is another reason why designing for individuals with disabilities is often an afterthought. Conclusion: This article proposes a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and technology designers in order to design products that could cater for the unique needs of individuals with disabilities. The article also emphasises the importance of exploring alternative interaction techniques, as they could enable individuals with disabilities to fully utilise technologies such as smart phones, computers and smart home electronics. © 2019 The Authors.},

abstract={Autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality in places with advanced infrastructure to support their operations. In crowded places, harsh environments, missions that require these vehicles to be aware of the context in which they are operating, and situations requiring continuous coordination with humans such as in disaster relief, advanced-vehicle systems (AVSs) need to be better contextually aware. The vast literature referring to 'context-aware systems' is still sparse, focusing on very limited forms of contextual awareness. It requires a structured approach to bring it together to truly realize contextual awareness in AVSs. This paper uses a human-AVSs (HAVSs) lens to polarize the literature in a coherent form suitable for designing distributed HAVSs. We group the relevant literature into two categories: contextual-awareness related to the vehicle infrastructure itself that enables AVSs to operate, and contextual-awareness related to HAVSs. The former category focuses on the communication backbone for AVSs including ad-hoc networks, services, wireless communication, radio systems, and the cyber security and privacy challenges that arise in these contexts. The latter category covers recommender systems, which are used to coordinate the actions that sit at the interface of the human and AVSs, human-machine interaction issues, and the activity recognition systems as the enabling technology for recommender systems to operate autonomously. The structured analysis of the literature has identified a number of open research questions and opportunities for further research in this area. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Data Mining (DM) is a fundamental component of the Data Science process. Over recent years a huge library of DM algorithms has been developed to tackle a variety of problems in fields such as medical imaging and traffic analysis. Many DM techniques are far more flexible than more classical numerial simulation or statistical modelling approaches. These could be usefully applied to data-rich environmental problems. Certain techniques such as artificial neural networks, clustering, case-based reasoning or Bayesian networks have been applied in environmental modelling, while other methods, like support vector machines among others, have yet to be taken up on a wide scale. There is greater scope for many lesser known techniques to be applied in environmental research, with the potential to contribute to addressing some of the current open environmental challenges. However, selecting the best DM technique for a given environmental problem is not a simple decision, and there is a lack of guidelines and criteria that helps the data scientist and environmental scientists to ensure effective knowledge extraction from data. This paper provides a broad introduction to the use of DM in Data Science processes for environmental researchers. Data Science contains three main steps (pre-processing, data mining and post-processing). This paper provides a conceptualization of Environmental Systems and a conceptualization of DM methods, which are in the core step of the Data Science process. These two elements define a conceptual framework that is on the basis of a new methodology proposed for relating the characteristics of a given environmental problem with a family of Data Mining methods. The paper provides a general overview and guidelines of DM techniques to a non-expert user, who can decide with this support which is the more suitable technique to solve their problem at hand. The decision is related to the bidimensional relationship between the type of environmental system and the type of DM method. An illustrative two way table containing references for each pair Environmental System-Data Mining method is presented and discussed. Some examples of how the proposed methodology is used to support DM method selection are also presented, and challenges and future trends are identified. © 2018},

abstract={In terms of software engineering, context-aware systems (C-AS) have notably different development needs than those of traditional computing. Yet, there are no established methodologies that uniformly support the development life-cycle of these systems. A key goal of this research is to improve the current state-of-the-art with respect to engineering techniques for the life-cycle of a C-AS. Within the scope of this higher order goal, this paper addresses the lower level order goal of a holistic framework for gathering requirements which is specialised to the creation of C-AS. The framework follows an end-user, stakeholder-centred vision, which guides the analysis of stakeholders towards the discovery of specific stakeholder profiles and their particular needs, preferences, and limitations. It allows the operationalisation of the high level objectives of the system into requirements, which are more tangible and related to the implementation of the system. An evaluation procedure is supported, based on heuristics and rules from the NFR framework and REUBI. All the diagrams introduced for this framework have been developed as part of an open-source tool based on Modelio, which is intended to be developed in the future as part of a framework that covers all the stages of the development process. The proposal is illustrated through the analysis of an application for a European funded project. © 2018 Polish Information Processing Society.},

abstract={Although the success of Health information system (HIS) has attracted many researchers to investigate the factors that affect the net-benefit in the success framework, to date, there is no comprehensive framework available for the success of the HIS, which takes the impact of user requirements factors in developing countries. Therefore, the present study addressed this gap by proposing a success framework which integrates the HIS quality and HIS user dimensions in the context of Yemen. The HIS users dimension includes the following factors: user requirements, user need, intention to use and user satisfaction. To validate the integrated framework, a quantitative method was used in which a self-administered structured questionnaire was distributed to a total of 250 employees, under HIS departments in seven hospitals in the capital Sanaa, Yemen. SPSS.VS.22.0 and AMOS VS.22 were used to design and analyze the framework. The results revealed that the factors in the HIS users have positive effect on the net benefit. In addition, the factors in the HIS users are influenced by the factors in the HIS quality. The Deleon’s and Mclean’s results indicated that the HIS quality has a positive relationship with the net benefits. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

Taking into consideration that these systems often operate in safety-critical environment, reconfiguration apropos of safety becomes a crucial concern. To this end, we introduce a conceptual framework that AIDS in safe reconfiguration of an open system-of-system, by the means of systematic monitoring and evaluation of the system and its components at runtime.

abstract={A self-adaptive system (SAS) can reconfigure at run time in response to adverse combinations of system and environmental conditions in order to continuously satisfy its requirements. Moreover, SASs are subject to cross-cutting non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as performance, security, and usability, that collectively characterize how functional requirements (FRs) are to be satisfied. In many cases, the trigger for adapting an SAS may be due to a violation of one or more NFRs. For a given NFR, different combinations of hierarchically-organized FRs may yield varying degrees of satisfaction (i.e., satisficement). This paper presents Providentia, a search-based technique to optimize NFR satisficement when subjected to various sources of uncertainty (e.g., environment, interactions between system elements, etc.). Providentia searches for optimal combinations of FRs that, when considered with different subgoal decompositions and/or differential weights, provide optimal satisficement of NFR objectives. Experimental results suggest that using an SAS goal model enhanced with search-based optimization significantly improves system performance when compared with manually- and randomly-generated weights and subgoals. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

Capability Driven Development methodology has supported delivering dynamic capabilities by providing context-aware self-adaptive platform in the CaaS project implementations, as our case study. Along with the already incorporated mechanisms, components that enable adaptability, there is open space for further evolutionary and deliberate change towards becoming truly appropriate methodology for dynamic reconfigurations of capabilities in organizations and business ecosystems that operate in complexity and uncertainty.

abstract={An application is context-aware if it uses context information to provide the user with relevant information or services. Generally, the process of making decisions about what information should be presented to the user taking into account a certain context is performed at design time. However, as the context usually changes during the execution of the system, the relevance of the information with respect to the context may be a ected while the system is running. Therefore, new approaches that take into account these dynamic changes during the decision-making process at runtime for context-aware applications are required. The authors of this paper argue that a decision-making process based on the runtime reassessment of context-based relevance can be used to improve the information or services provided to the user under uncertain conditions which were not totally foreseen previously. The services can be in the form of suggested system adaptations. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we present a novel case study from the domain of virtual education, which involves an adaptive context-aware learning management system. We demonstrate positive improvements to the autonomous decision-making support for this kind of systems. © 2018 Conferencia Iberoamericana de Software Engineering - CIbSE. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Context: A suitable representation of Safety-Critical Systems (SCS) requirements is crucial to avoid misunderstandings in safety requirements and issues in safety specification. However, current general requirements specification languages do not fully support the particularities of specifying SCS. Objective: In this paper, our goal is to identify and propose a set of important features that should be provided by requirements languages to support an early safety requirements specification. Moreover, we aim to compare the ability of the four most used Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) languages (i∗, KAOS, GRL, NFR-Framework) in supporting the proposed features. Method: We first established a conceptual foundation and a conceptual model based on the literature, challenges elicited in previous works, and demands of safety standards at the requirements level that practitioners must satisfy in order to certify their systems. Results: We proposed a set of 15 features that requirements languages should provide to an early safety requirements specification. Regarding the comparison of GORE languages, in summary, all surveyed languages lacks explicit modeling constructs to express how hazards can occur in the system, the accidents, their impact and how they can mitigated. Conclusions: The conceptual foundation, conceptual model, and the set of features is a novelty. Finally, the features can be used to propose new requirements languages for SCS or to define extensions for the ones already available. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Maintenance planning and energy consumption control are critical issues in facility operations management. In practice, the energy consumption of a facility, which will be affected by the operation condition, is closely connected with the associated maintenance policy. Specifically, for an energy-consuming service system, though a frequent maintenance activity can keep the facility in a good condition with low energy consumption, it makes the delay time longer and leads to a poor customer experience. In this paper, we study a single-server queueing system with different energy consumption levels in the associated running states to address the conflict between energy consumption and customer delay. Two types of maintenance activities are implemented for the server, i.e., the planned maintenance and the reactive maintenance. The planned maintenance is adopted based on a frequency parameter at the beginning of an idle period, and the reactive maintenance is initialized by the Shewhart's individual control chart (condition-based maintenance). To capture the energy-delay tradeoff, our objective is to develop an optimal maintenance policy that minimizes the long-run expected total cost of the system under a customer waiting time constraint. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the problem, in which useful managerial insights are obtained for the optimal maintenance policy. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed maintenance model, its advantage over the model without control chart, and its applicability in general situations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In addition, we illustrate the interrelationships among the dimensions. By using this model, we further explain how the 18 types of project teams discussed in the literature could be more effectively presented.

abstract={Service engineering of digital service ecosystems can be associated with several challenges, such as change and evolution of requirements; gathering of quality requirements and assessment; and uncertainty caused by dynamic nature and unknown deployment environment, composition and users. Therefore, the complexity and dynamics in which these digital services are deployed call for solutions to make them autonomic. Until now there has been no up-to-date review of the scientific literature on the application of the autonomic computing initiative in the digital service ecosystems domain. This article presents a review and comparison of autonomic computing methods in digital service ecosystems from the perspective of service engineering, i.e., requirements engineering and architecting of services. The review is based on systematic queries in four leading scientific databases and Google Scholar, and it is organized in four thematic research areas. A comparison framework has been defined which can be used as a guide for comparing the different methods selected. The goal is to discover which methods are suitable for the service engineering of digital service ecosystems with autonomic computing capabilities, highlight what the shortcomings of the methods are, and identify which research activities need to be conducted in order to overcome these shortcomings. The comparison reveals that none of the existing methods entirely fulfills the requirements that are defined in the comparison framework. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Self-Adaptive Systems are able to change their behavior at runtime according to the environment where they are. This study presents an approach to specify the requirements for self-adaptive systems based on the concepts of Fuzzy Logic, which deals with factors such as ambiguity, uncertainties and vague information on the solution of problems; and NFR-Framework, which deals with the non-functional requirements which, very often, vaguely and full of uncertainties present themselves. Adaptive systems consist of (functional and non-functional) requirements, which hold the capacity to modify themselves during the runtime with little or no human intervention at all. Requirements that carry out the feature of wide variability are called adaptive requirements. PERSA (acronym from "Processo de Especificação de Requisitos Adaptativos", in Portuguese) is reported in this work, using the Fuzzy Logic and the NFR-Framework as a basis, since both offers resources to manage uncertainties, an inherent attribute of self-adaptive systems. This process aims the approach of specification of adaptive requirements in a systematic way providing a guide to support requirements engineers. PERSA Process is settled in three mains phases subdivided into several steps. Two case studies were developed to validate it: the first deals with an automated system to prepare steaks, which needs to adapt to its several types; the second relates to a system for automation for canine diets, which must be adapted to different breeds of dogs according to their size, weight and classification. The case studies provide a first approach of the use and benefits of PERSA Process. In these studied the theoretical proposal was evaluated and discussed in order to establish the degree of understanding, the clarity of activities and the necessary adjustments to improve the proposed achievements, thus obtaining a satisfactory though early assessment which answers the purpose of specifying the requirements for self-adaptive systems. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Technologies of varying complexity must be combined to produce the underlying Health Smart Home system, and processing of the resulting data may require methods of varying sophistication. These aspects have been well studied, but no widely-adopted approaches for practical implementation of systems or systematic processing of data have been developed. Also, the integration of Health Smart Home services with the overall health care system has not been regularized. This paper identifies and categorizes the emerging high-level challenges beyond those in the basic technical and algorithmic spaces. These challenges will influence future directions for Health Smart Homes and their wider adoption and integration with health systems. © 2017 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.},

abstract={The business model concept is a common topic investigated in different fields of research. To participate to the debate around such concept in the accounting field, the objective of this paper is showing whether and how the voluntary disclosure of the non-mandatory IASB (2010) macro-components, that we consider the key elements of a business model of financial entities, increases the value relevance of accounting amounts. Analyzing a sample of 124 European financial entities over the period 2010–2013, the paper shows that the value relevance of accounting amounts of entities that provide a wide disclosure of their business model is higher than the one of entities that provide a limited disclosure of their business model. These findings not only shed lights about the importance of disclosing information relating to the business model to improve the usefulness of accounting amounts for investors’ strategies, but also have implication for regulators and standard setters that from results could learn the opportunity to make the disclosure of IASB (2010) compulsory for all the IAS/IFRS compliant entities. © 2016 ASEPUC},

abstract={This paper's main objective is to consolidate the knowledge on context in the realm of intelligent systems, systems that are aware of their context and can adapt their behavior accordingly. We provide an overview and analysis of 36 context models that are heterogeneous and scattered throughout multiple fields of research. In our analysis, we identify five shared context categories: social context, location, time, physical context, and user context. In addition, we compare the context models with the context elements considered in the discourse on intelligent systems and find that the models do not properly represent the identified set of 3,741 unique context elements. As a result, we propose a consolidation of the findings from the 36 context models and the 3,741 unique context elements. The analysis reveals that there is a long tail of context categories that are considered only sporadically in context models. However, particularly these context elements in the long tail may be necessary for improving intelligent systems' context awareness. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The necessity of industries for ascending their standards in competitive market occurs in convention of benchmarking techniques and to adopt new modern methods for effective system. The rationale of this study is to review the benchmarking techniques, moreover to rank them on the basis of applications in service industries. The authors have done abundant survey which identified seven different benchmarking techniques for Indian service industries. Thus, it becomes more complex to select the best one of the benchmarking techniques for implementation in industries. To rank the different benchmarking techniques, a hybrid methodology of analytical network process (ANP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and multi-objective optimisation on basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) is used. A novel hybrid model of these three MCDM is applied for prioritising the benchmarking techniques in the Indian scenario. With application of hybrid model, ranking of best alternative is obtained with fewer calculations and simple validation. Thus, endeavour has been made by authors to give a model for evaluation of benchmarking techniques through MCDM approaches which gives confidence for executives to adopt benchmarking for achieving their goals in their industries.

abstract={Context-aware applications development is still a challenging issue due to their adaptive behavior complexity and uncertainty features. A conceptual framework, as an ideal reuse technique, is one of the most suitable solutions to simplify the development of such systems and overcome their development complexity. We aim in this paper to design a framework that promotes the ability to specify and verify context-aware systems to assist and facilitate designer's task. The objective is gained here by combining two complementary modeling techniques: Model-driven Engineering (MDE) and Formal Methods. Model-driven technique is adopted to design a modeling framework for context-aware systems. Nevertheless, this technique generally lacks formal semantics and it is unfit for model analysis. Therefore, we define a formal semantics to overcome these drawbacks. Moreover, we show how context-aware system's adaptive behavior can be verified according to their invariants by applying model-checking techniques. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Software self-adaptation (SSA) is a capability that enables a software system to adjust itself to react to the frequent changes from external environments, user requirements and its own. It has become a hot topic in software engineering community in recent years. Due to the natural similarity between the “sense-decide-adjust” self-adaptation loop and the “sense-plan-act” control loop, it grows an important paradigm to use control theory as a research tool to deal with issues of SSA. In this paper, a survey is made on the-state-of-the-art of the research of SSA based on control theory. Firstly, the concepts and principles of SSA are explained and discussed. Secondly, the research ideas and representative work of control theory based SSA are explored. Thirdly, on the basis of the provision of our reviewing method and process, this paper defines a framework for reviewing. Moreover, using this reviewing framework, the paper thoroughly analyzes and compares the state-of-the-art of existing work from the perspectives of control engineering and software engineering with such classifying criteria as control structures, conceptual frameworks, theory foundations, development approach, and evaluating methods. Finally, the paper identifies deficiency of current work and predicts future research trends. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Model-driven development allows IT professionals to specify the system functionality, organization and behavior in a logical or platform-independent manner. Modeling using services allows domain analysts to focus on the added-value and core business the enterprise offers to its stakeholders. Those services are coarse-grained elements able to encapsulate a composition of business process models. The framework presented in this paper provides models together at strategic, tactical and operational levels to develop an agent-oriented software system. The strategic level is concerned with long-term decisions; this top-level uses a service model to understand the business' high-level (added) values as well as the Quality Expectations and the threats they face. The tactical level is concerned with a broader description of the business processes automated by the system; the i* strategic dependency and rationale models are used here to further document the service behavior. Actors' accountability and responsibility can be determined in the visual representation of these strategic and tactical levels. Finally, i* models are mapped into a set of operational models to document the (multi-agent) system behavior when achieving modeled functionalities. These operational models instantiate the Belief/Desire/Intentions (BDI) paradigm proposing entities - the agents - mapping as closely as possible the real life organization. The paper thus builds a business-driven transformation process leading to a run-time agent-architecture in a single and common framework. It both uses existing models and introduces or refines existing ones to dispose of a method ensuring better alignment and traceability between the business and the IT system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={As computing infrastructure expands, resource management in a large, heterogeneous, and distributed environment becomes a challenging task. In a cloud environment, with uncertainty and dispersion of resources, one encounters problems of allocation of resources, which is caused by things such as heterogeneity, dynamism, and failures. Unfortunately, existing resource management techniques, frameworks, and mechanisms are insufficient to handle these environments, applications, and resource behaviors. To provide efficient performance of workloads and applications, the aforementioned characteristics should be addressed effectively. This research depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of autonomic resource management in the area of the cloud in general and QoS (Quality of Service)-aware autonomic resource management specifically. The current status of autonomic resource management in cloud computing is distributed into various categories. Methodical analysis of autonomic resource management in cloud computing and its techniques are described as developed by various industry and academic groups. Further, taxonomy of autonomic resource management in the cloud has been presented. This research work will help researchers find the important characteristics of autonomic resource management and will also help to select the most suitable technique for autonomic resource management in a specific application along with significant future research directions. © 2015 ACM.},

So to deal with the problem, numerousapproaches are proposed. Some approaches are interested tointegrate the Quality of Service (QoS) to select the suitableservice. The QoS plays an important role in the discovery andselection process of web services within many similar functionalservices.

abstract={We formalise and present a new generic multifaceted complex system approach for modelling complex business enterprises. Our method has a strong focus on integrating the various data types available in an enterprise which represent the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders. We explain the challenges faced and define a novel approach to converting diverse data types into usable Bayesian probability forms. The data types that can be integrated include historic data, survey data, and management planning data, expert knowledge and incomplete data. The structural complexities of the complex system modelling process, based on various decision contexts, are also explained along with a solution. This new application of complex system models as a management tool for decision making is demonstrated using a railway transport case study. The case study demonstrates how the new approach can be utilised to develop a customised decision support model for a specific enterprise. Various decision scenarios are also provided to illustrate the versatility of the decision model at different phases of enterprise operations such as planning and control.

abstract={The correct operation of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) is vital for the well being of society, however these complex systems are subject to multiple faults and threats every day. International organizations around the world are alerting the scientific community to the need for protection of CIs, especially through preparedness and prevention mechanisms. One of the main tools available in this area is the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, in order to deploy this type of component within a CI, especially within its Control System (CS), it is necessary to verify whether the characteristics of a given IDS solution are compatible with the special requirements and constraints of a critical environment. In this paper, we carry out an extensive study to determine the requirements imposed by the CS on the IDS solutions using the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Framework. The outcome of this process are the abstract properties that the IDS needs to satisfy in order to be deployed within a CS, which are refined through the identification of satisficing techniques for the NFRs. To provide quantifiable measurable evidence on the suitability of the IDS component for a CI, we broaden our study using the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach to select a representative set of metrics. A requirements model, refined with satisficing techniques and sets of metrics which help assess, in the most quantifiable way possible, the suitability and performance of a given IDS solution for a critical scenario, constitutes the results of our analysis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Critical embedded systems (CES) have become ubiquitous in the modern society, like in cars and energy appliances. However, besides their popularity, engineering of these systems is still particularly challenging. One of the greatest challenges in the development of such systems is their expected high standards of reliability. One of the key solutions to overcome this challenge is to design a sound architecture and validate it against critical quality attributes (CQAs), such as safety, dependability, security and performance. However, currently there are no established architecting processes or methods that are specialized for the domain of CES. Consequently, these systems are sometimes developed without focusing on their architectural design and their level of quality. Thus, the main goal of this PhD project is to develop an architecture design method, specialized in decisions that impacts CQAs. In the context of this project, the proposed method will be evaluated, through an industrial collaborations, with companies of two important application domains: Smart Grid and Ambient Assisted Living.

abstract={An increasing amount of today's software systems is developed by dynamically composing available atomic services to form a single service that responds to consumers' demand. These composite services are distributed across the network, adapted dynamically during run-time, and still required to work correctly and be available on demand. The development of these kinds of modern services requires new modeling and analysis methods and techniques to enable service reliability during run-time. In this paper, we define the required phases of the composite service design and execution to achieve reliable composite service. These phases are described in the form of a framework. We perform a literature survey of existing methods and approaches for reliable composite services to find out how they match with the criteria of our framework. The contribution of the work is to reveal the current status in the research field of reliable composite service engineering. © 2014 The Author(s).},

With this process model, we strive for an engineering aspiration within the domain of Smart Grids. The process model is set up with an initial conceptualisation phase followed by an iterable cycle of five phases with both analytical and experimental parts, giving detailed information on inputs and results for each phase and identifying the needed actors for each phase. Simulation of large-scale Smart Grid scenarios is a core component of SGAE. We therefore elaborate on tooling and techniques needed in that context and illustrate the whole process model using an application example from a finished research and development project. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The whole task of e-government evaluation is carried out in three phases. The first phase discusses the design of a scale for e-government evaluation. The second phase accentuates on developing the test cases for each indicator (of the devised scale) to collect the citizen's feedback. The third phase refers to test run the approach in the selected government bodies. Since the approach is result-oriented, the reports on the basis of generated results are delivered to the stakeholders to initiate learning process.

abstract={Farmers' decisions about adopting conservation practices are inherently dynamic, affected by changes in environmental, economic, and social conditions, including interactions with other farmers. Water quality models that are used to assess agricultural policy interventions, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), lack the dynamic social component of farmer's decisions. While agent-based models (ABM) can represent and explore these decision dynamics, ABMs have not been connected to water quality models that can measure environmental outcomes of farmer decisions. Connecting ABMs and SWAT could advance the development of targeted conservation policies. Toward this aim, we developed a typology of Corn Belt farmers based on farmer characteristics that could be employed in an ABM and be relevant to water quality outcomes. Because our typology was developed for use in an ABM and to link to an existing water quality model (SWAT), it had distinctive simplicity (to optimize utility of the ABM) and relevance to characteristics modeled by SWAT. To identify farmer characteristics, we reviewed the literature on conservation practices that could be represented in SWAT models and their adoption by Corn Belt farmers. We found that land tenure arrangements, farm size, source of income, and information networks were consistently identified as farmer characteristics that influence conservation practice decision-making, were simple and relevant. Employing these characteristics, we identified four types of farmers to populate an ABM that will be linked to SWAT: (1) "Traditional": small operations relying primarily on on-farm income; (2) "Supplementary": small operations relying primarily on off-farm income; (3) "Business-oriented": medium to large operations relying primarily on on-farm income and well connected to information networks; (4) "Non-operator": absentee and/or investor farmland owners with limited connection to local information networks. This typology represents the heterogeneity of Corn Belt farmers relevant to their adoption of conservation practices. It gives us the conceptual framework for an ABM that can be linked with SWAT to explore coupled social and biophysical processes within Corn Belt agroecosystems, focusing on alternative approaches to targeting conservation policy to effectively reduce sediment and nutrient runoff. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The impact of simulation methods for social research in the Information Systems (IS) research field remains low. A concern is our field is inadequately leveraging the unique strengths of simulation methods. Although this low impact is frequently attributed to methodological complexity, we offer an alternative explanation-the poor construction of research value. We argue a more intuitive value construction, better connected to the knowledge base, will facilitate increased value and broader appreciation. Meta-analysis of studies published in IS journals over the last decade evidences the low impact. To facilitate value construction, we synthesize four common types of simulation research contribution: Analyzer, Tester, Descriptor, and Theorizer. To illustrate, we employ the proposed typology to describe how each type of value is structured in simulation research and connect each type to instances from IS literature, thereby making these value types and their construction visible and readily accessible to the general IS community.},

abstract={Mission-critical software (MCS) must provide continuous, online services to ensure the successful accomplishment of critical missions. Self-adaptation is particularly desirable for assuring the quality of service (QoS) and availability of MCS under uncertainty. Few techniques have insofar addressed the issue of MCS self-adaptation, and most existing approaches to software self-adaptation fail to take into account uncertainty in the self-adaptation loop. To tackle this problem, we propose a fuzzy control based approach, i.e., Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA), with a view to deal with the challenge of MCS self-adaptation under uncertainty. First, we present the SFSA conceptual framework, consisting of sensing, deciding and acting stages, and establish the formal model of SFSA to lay a rigorous and mathematical foundation of our approach. Second, we develop a novel SFSA implementation technology as well as its supporting tool, i.e., the SFSA toolkit, to automate the realization process of SFSA. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the development of an adaptive MCS application in process control systems. Validation experiments show that the fuzzy control based approach proposed in this work is effective and with low overheads. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York & Science Press, China.},

abstract={Information affects almost all aspects of life, and thus the Quality of Information (IQ) plays a critical role in businesses and societies; It can have significant positive and negative impacts on the quality of life of citizens, employees and organizations. Over many years aspects and challenges of IQ have been studied within various contexts. As a result, the general approach to the study of IQ has offered numerous management and measurement approaches, IQ frameworks and list of IQ criteria. As the volume of data and information increases, IQ problems become pervasive. Whereas earlier studies investigated specific aspects of IQ, the next phase of IQ research will need to examine IQ in a wider context, thus its impact on the quality of life and societies. In this paper we apply an IQ oriented framework to two cases, cloud computing and lifelogging, illustrating the impact of IQ on the quality of life. The paper demonstrates the value of the framework, the impact IQ can have on the quality of life and in summary provides a foundation for further research.

abstract={Management of the enterprise architecture has become increasingly recognized as a crucial part of both business and IT management. Still, a common understanding and methodological consistency seems far from being developed. Acknowledging the significant role of research in moving the development process along, this article employs different bibliometric methods, complemented by an extensive qualitative interpretation of the research field, to provide a unique overview of the enterprise architecture literature. After answering our research questions about the collaboration via co-authorships, the intellectual structure of the research field and its most influential works, and the principal themes of research, we propose an agenda for future research based on the findings from the above analyses and their comparison to empirical insights from the literature. In particular, our study finds a considerable degree of co-authorship clustering and a positive impact of the extent of co-authorship on the diffusion of works on enterprise architecture. In addition, this article identifies three major research streams and shows that research to date has revolved around specific themes, while some of high practical relevance receive minor attention. Hence, the contribution of our study is manifold and offers support for researchers and practitioners alike. © 2013 by the Association for Information Systems.},

abstract={Software is constantly evolving. Evolution becomes necessary to respond to changes that may occur in the requirements and/or in the environment in which it is embedded. A consequence of changes is that several activities (such as analysis, verification, code generation, deployment) need to be redone, over and over. This paper focuses on verification. Incrementality comes into play because often changes are local to restricted parts. In order to save time, it would be beneficial if instead of redoing activities from scratch after each change, the results of previous processing may be reused and composed with the results of processing restricted portions of the changed software. Incrementality becomes even more necessary when changes occur at runtime and the software itself is responsible for reacting in a self-managed manner. In this setting, the processing that needs to be performed after each change is subject to severe time constraints. The paper is a position statement on incrementality in the context of self-adaptive systems. It starts by motivating the need for incrementality and then reviews three main approaches to incremental verification that have been proposed earlier, compares their potential, and outlines promising research directions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Instead of working with softgoals at design time, the proposal described in this paper combines propagation rules, fuzzy logic and Multi-Agent Systems in order to provide support for dealing with softgoals at runtime. Observing, for example, how the Requirements Engineering community deals with softgoals analysis by using propagation rules, we developed a propagation simulator centered on a specific algorithm. This simulator tries to replicate the requirements engineers' practices when using propagation rules to make decisions at design time. Based on this propagation simulator, we propose an intentional-MAS-driven reasoning engine capable of analyzing softgoals at runtime by selecting an adequate strategy (i.e. an adequate plan) that will be performed by the intentional agent to achieve the desired goal. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Dynamic adaptation of complex distributed systems is largely based on requirement engineering and change management. The growing complexity, uncertainty, and instability of environment create a problem for traditional global control and total quality management approaches. The new generation of tools supporting the flow of requests for change and their impact on operational system performance with respect to Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) offer tractability of all requested and completed services. The hard part is in determining the possible general impact of changes on the system in the medium and long-term time intervals as well as to negotiate and modify the flow of changes as to maximize SLO utility and satisfy important high-level non-functional requirements. The current paper proposes an architecture and a framework allowing to simplify the holistic aspects of requirement engineering and change management. The architecture organically incorporates a highlevel feature set balancing and optimization processes dynamically linked to the workflow of virtualized resource management operations. © Common Ground, Alexander Vengerov, Stephen Klein, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Presented in this paper is the Patient Assessment-Data Quality Model (PA-DQM). It is designed to assess how patient datasets which are poor in composition can impact on the decision processes following patient assessment. The PA-DQM in particular examines four key Data Quality (DQ) dimensions: timeliness, accuracy, consistency and completeness. This DQ model is generic in nature as any number of decision making processes can be substituted to reflect the medical scenario under consideration. For example, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, Emergency Room (ER) triage systems or Modified Early Warning Scorecards (MEWS). The PA-DQM presented is evaluated using the MEWS process as an exemplar. Paper based MEWS are utilised to assist medical staff identify at risk patients with a declining health status. The calculated MEWS score is designed to trigger earlier medical interventions to avoid or reduce the potential impact of catastrophic events. In particular the existing MEWS system which (i.e. a paper based approach) is evaluated alongside an electronic- Modified Early Warning Scorecard (e-MEWS) system, which is designed and developed to reduce the number ofDQ issues which continue to persist with the paper based process. To validate the assertions presented in this paper a workshop (participation of 51 medical staff) was held in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, Ireland, where the paper based MEWS has been adopted for the last 3 years. It is clear from our initial findings that the proposed e- MEWS system has the ability to greatly enhance the levels of DQ over its existing paper based counterpart.},

abstract={The paper presents and discusses the notion of service scenarios. A service is work done by a service executor in interaction with a service consumer. A service scenario is a model of a service system and the roles that are played by the actors that participate and interact during the execution of a service. The model represents the roles and the interactions between the participants. Service scenarios can be used to model specific services and the roles played by human beings and IT systems in the execution of services. The use of service scenarios is demonstrated by means of a case study in a public library. The case study indicates that service systems should be understood as socio-technical systems in which service executors and service consumers co-create value in mutual interaction with each other and with a set of shared resources.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce MaDcAr, a model of engines for dynamic and automatic (re)assembling of component-based software. In MaDcAr, an application description consists of the definition of some valid configurations and the state transfer rules to apply during adaptations. This description is uncoupled from any implementation and can therefore be reused with other components. Given an application description, a MaDcAr engine builds a constraint solving problem that makes it possible to choose an appropriate configuration and the components to assemble. This choice takes into account the cost of the target configuration with respect to the available resources. To ensure the application consistency, the engine relies on the state transfer rules to initialize the component attributes of the target assembly using the component attributes of the source assembly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.},

abstract={Several Software Architecture Design Methods (SADM) have been published, reviewed, and compared. But these surveys and comparisons are mostly centered on intrinsic elements of the design method, and they do not compare them from the perspective of the actual needs of software architects. We would like to analyze the completeness of SADM from an architect's point of view. To do so, we define nine categories of software architects' needs, propose an ordinal scale for evaluating the degree to which a given SADM meets the needs, and then apply this to a small set of SADMs. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (i) to provide a different and useful frame of reference for architects to select SADM, and (H) to suggest SADM areas of improvements. We found two answers to our question: "do architectural design methods meet the needs of the architect?" Yes, all architect's needs are met by one or another SADM, but No, no architectural design method meets simultaneously all the needs of an architect. This approach may lead to improvements of existing SADMs. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The cost of research & development (R&D) and quality management are always regarded as two major parts of total cost. The variable performance of R&D and quality design is an important index that will reflect the effectiveness of the cost reduction. This research has attempted to simultaneously vary all of the variables to achieve the global optimum for the optimal variable selections of R&D and quality design. Genetic algorithm (GA) can treat all of the variables for the global search. In this study, fuzzy refinement with orthogonal arrays was effective in improving the performance of the GA, and also showed the benefits of a good chromosome structure on the behavior of GA. It is also proposed the postponement design with temporal concept, to select the effective variables for the cost reduction of R&D and quality management design. The experimental results showed that tempo-postponement design will increase the flexibility and quick response for supply chain management. Hence, this approach can act as a useful guideline for researchers working on the optimization of the key variable selections for R&D and quality model design. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Future large-scale software development projects will require engineering support for a diverse range of software quality attributes, such as privacy and openness. It is not feasible to create one monolithic methodology to support all possible quality attributes. Instead, we expect AOSE methodologies to be created and reused in a modular way. A modular approach enables developers to build custom project-specific methodologies from AOSE features in the same way applications are built from reusable off-the-shelf components. In this paper, we provide a conceptual framework for creating and reusing modular methodologies. This conceptual framework is based on the concept of an AOSE feature, which performs one or more development activities, such as analysis, and addresses one or more quality attributes, such as privacy. An AOSE feature encapsulates software engineering techniques, models, supporting CASE tools and development knowledge such as design patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach by modularizing four existing methodologies, Prometheus, ROADMAP, CaseLP and the conventional OO approach, into AOSE features.},

abstract={Adaptation of software systems is almost an inevitable process, due to the change in customer requirements, needs for faster development of new, or maintenance of existing, software systems, etc. No doubt numerous techniques have been developed to deal with adaptation of software systems. In this paper we present an overview of some of these techniques. As the first step in the development of software solution it is our opinion that software architecture should itself be adaptable for the final software system ta be adaptable. In order to systematically support adaptation at the architectural level, this paper adapts the NFR (Non-Functional Requirements) Framework and treats software adaptability requirement as a goal to be achieved during development. Through this adaptation, then, consideration of design alternatives, analysis of tradeoffs and rationalization of design decisions are all carried out in relation to the stated goals, and captured in historical records. This NFR approach can also be adapted to a knowledge-based approach for (semi-)automatically generating architectures for adaptable software systems and we also discuss how this can be achieved.},
