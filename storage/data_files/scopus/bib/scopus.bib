abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a scale for the evaluation of the perceived quality of services provided to students with disabilities by Special Vocational Education (SVE) institutions in Greece. Design/methodology/approach: SVE service quality was approached on the basis of the performance-only model. The participatory research paradigm was followed, engaging students with disability and specifically with intellectual disability in several stages of the instrument development. The methodological design included two phases for the establishment and testing of the reliability and validity of the scale. Findings: The findings of the study support a multifactorial construct of SVE service quality consisting of five factors: responsiveness, surroundings, personalization, training and facilities adequacy. Research limitations/implications: Generalization of results should be attempted with concern. The type and severity of disability should be considered in future use of the scale. The construct of training for students with disability needs to be further investigated. Practical implications: SVE-Service-Quality Scale may be used in SVE settings highlighting areas of improvement or as an instrument for the assessment of implemented interventions. Social implications: Participatory research may serve as an empowerment opportunity for students with disability, whose active engagement in the research design allows for a small-scale yet valuable social impact, promoting emancipation for people with disability. Originality/value: The study draws attention on the field of SVE service quality where research is scarce, introducing SVE in the discussion about educational service quality assessment. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Smart PSS (product-service system) has been transcending the scope of traditional PSS through ICTs (information and communication technologies). The co-implementation is a specific way of co-creation to generate value for customer and supplier in smart PSS. Meanwhile, the service failures in co-implementation can bring about service paradox. As such, three key research questions, including the construction of co-implementation of smart PSS, the extension of risk factors in FMECA and the category of identified failure modes, are put forward and conquered by a proposed methodological framework. First, in order to construct the co-implementation of smart PSS involving customer and supplier, the PCN (process-chain-network) diagram with direct interaction, surrogate interaction and independent handling is employed to reflect the nature of interaction. Second, since that the highly complexity of co-implementation of smart PSS can lead to more huge risk, an extended-FMECA (failure mode effect and criticality analysis) sheet is formulated by considering the adaptation of autonomy. Third, to handle the uncertainty of expert judgments more reasonably and determine the weights of risk factors without additional information, a hybrid approach integrating rough-entropy-ELECTRE TRI is proposed to classify failure modes into ordinal classes, so that decision-makers can swiftly access them. This proposed methodological framework also is illustrated by the co-implementation of smart fridge-service system, in which the feasibility and superiority are verified by analysing comparative results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Applying the concepts of technological ecosystems to the care and assistance domain is an emerging field that has gained interest during the last years, as they allow to describe the complex relationships between actors in a technologically boosted care domain. In that context, this paper presents a systematic review and mapping of the literature to identify, analyse and classify the published research carried out to provide care and assistance services under a technological ecosystems’ perspective. Thirty-seven papers were identified in the literature as relevant and analysed in detail (between 2003–2018). The main findings show that it is indeed an emerging field, as few of the found ecosystem proposals have been developed in the real world nor have they been tested with real users. In addition, a lot of research to date reports the proposal of platform-centric architectures developed over existing platforms not specifically developed for care and services provision. Employed sensor technologies for providing services have very diverse natures depending on the intended services to be provided. However, many of these technologies do not take into account medical standards. The degree of the ecosystems’ openness to adding new devices greatly depends on the approach followed, such as the type of middleware considered. Thus, there is still much work to be done in order to equate other more established ecosystems such as business or software ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Individuals with disabilities experience difficulty in using various everyday technologies such as computers and smartphones. Objectives: To propose a conceptual framework that will lead to the development of practical and user friendly assistive technology. Method: A literature review of challenges faced by individuals with physical disabilities was carried out. Interviews with adults with physical disabilities in Kampala, Uganda, and Port Elizabeth, South Africa, identified three main challenges with regard to using technology: using a mobile phone, controlling an electronic environment and using a computer. Results: The challenges identified can be solved by taking into consideration the needs of individuals with disabilities. However, the design of new technologies and interaction techniques, such as natural hand gestures and voice, as input mechanisms has able-bodied individuals in mind. Individuals with disabilities are considered as an afterthought. The main reason for this is that individuals with a disability are a minority and hence it may not make economic sense for technology innovators to cater for their unique needs. A lack of practical guidelines on how to design for individuals with disabilities is another reason why designing for individuals with disabilities is often an afterthought. Conclusion: This article proposes a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and technology designers in order to design products that could cater for the unique needs of individuals with disabilities. The article also emphasises the importance of exploring alternative interaction techniques, as they could enable individuals with disabilities to fully utilise technologies such as smart phones, computers and smart home electronics. © 2019 The Authors.},

abstract={The use of agile methodologies like SCRUM is seen by companies in the software engineering field as a strategic necessity for their competitiveness, which makes them more reactive and dynamic in an increasingly demanding and competitive international market. One of the critical factors in the implementation of a SCRUM environment is the set-up of teams that are simultaneously homogeneous and composed of the best collaborators for each SCRUM role. In this sense, this study describes the modeling process and presents the implementation of a decision support system that can contribute to improving the process of assigning an agile team simultaneously considering the technical and social skills of employees. The results of the study allowed testing the application considering different competencies associated to each Agile position, the impact that the attribution process suffers from oscillations in the process of evaluation and self-evaluation, and the impact in terms of the performance of the inclusion of new collaborators and criteria comparison.

abstract={Autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality in places with advanced infrastructure to support their operations. In crowded places, harsh environments, missions that require these vehicles to be aware of the context in which they are operating, and situations requiring continuous coordination with humans such as in disaster relief, advanced-vehicle systems (AVSs) need to be better contextually aware. The vast literature referring to 'context-aware systems' is still sparse, focusing on very limited forms of contextual awareness. It requires a structured approach to bring it together to truly realize contextual awareness in AVSs. This paper uses a human-AVSs (HAVSs) lens to polarize the literature in a coherent form suitable for designing distributed HAVSs. We group the relevant literature into two categories: contextual-awareness related to the vehicle infrastructure itself that enables AVSs to operate, and contextual-awareness related to HAVSs. The former category focuses on the communication backbone for AVSs including ad-hoc networks, services, wireless communication, radio systems, and the cyber security and privacy challenges that arise in these contexts. The latter category covers recommender systems, which are used to coordinate the actions that sit at the interface of the human and AVSs, human-machine interaction issues, and the activity recognition systems as the enabling technology for recommender systems to operate autonomously. The structured analysis of the literature has identified a number of open research questions and opportunities for further research in this area. © 2013 IEEE.},

To participate to the debate around such concept in the accounting field, the objective of this paper is showing whether and how the voluntary disclosure of the non-mandatory IASB (2010) macro-components, that we consider the key elements of a business model of financial entities, increases the value relevance of accounting amounts. Analyzing a sample of 124 European financial entities over the period 2010–2013, the paper shows that the value relevance of accounting amounts of entities that provide a wide disclosure of their business model is higher than the one of entities that provide a limited disclosure of their business model. These findings not only shed lights about the importance of disclosing information relating to the business model to improve the usefulness of accounting amounts for investors’ strategies, but also have implication for regulators and standard setters that from results could learn the opportunity to make the disclosure of IASB (2010) compulsory for all the IAS/IFRS compliant entities. © 2016 ASEPUC},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living Systems are considered as a particular application of more general user-centered systems. Although that this domain is specifically evolving in a very fast rate, till now, at the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant learning environment intended to educate next generations of professional designers and developers of AALS. In this paper, we attempt to provide a resources oriented model for gamified, collaborative and adaptive environment for acquisition and transfer of skills related to design and engineering of Intelligent/Ambient Assisted Living Systems (AALS). In this environment, we adopt design and methodology principles, related to Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITS), Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCLs) as well as simulation and Gamification. © 2015 Lavoisier.},

abstract={This chapter aims to identify, analyze, and classify the methodologies and methods described in the literature for the usability evaluation of systems and services based on information and communication technologies. The methodology used was a systematic review of the literature. The studies included in the analysis were classified into empirical and analytical methodologies (test, inquiry, controlled experiment, or inspection). A total of 2116 studies were included, of which 1308 were classified. In terms of results, the inquiry methodology was the most frequent in this review, followed by test, inspection, and finally, the controlled experiment methodology. A combination of methodologies is relatively common, especially the combination of test and inquiry methodologies, probably because they assess different but complementary aspects of usability contributing to a more comprehensive assessment. © 2015, IGI Global.

abstract={Though customer orientation is recommended in Business Process Management, current modeling methods still have a strong focus on the company's processes. To ensure a long-lasting requirement of a firm's service, one should consider the customer activities in order to offer an added value that effectively addresses his or her needs. Thus, the customers' perspective and their process chains before, during and after the interaction need to be captured in Business Process Management. Michael Hewing takes a design-oriented research approach to show how the integration of well-grounded marketing methods enables the visualization and analysis of the customer's point of view in Business Process Management. By enhancing this method, information on usage processes as well as on the value-in-use can be provided for a comprehensive and process-based customer management. © 2014 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.

abstract={Critical embedded systems (CES) have become ubiquitous in the modern society, like in cars and energy appliances. However, besides their popularity, engineering of these systems is still particularly challenging. One of the greatest challenges in the development of such systems is their expected high standards of reliability. One of the key solutions to overcome this challenge is to design a sound architecture and validate it against critical quality attributes (CQAs), such as safety, dependability, security and performance. However, currently there are no established architecting processes or methods that are specialized for the domain of CES. Consequently, these systems are sometimes developed without focusing on their architectural design and their level of quality. Thus, the main goal of this PhD project is to develop an architecture design method, specialized in decisions that impacts CQAs. In the context of this project, the proposed method will be evaluated, through an industrial collaborations, with companies of two important application domains: Smart Grid and Ambient Assisted Living.

abstract={Information affects almost all aspects of life, and thus the Quality of Information (IQ) plays a critical role in businesses and societies; It can have significant positive and negative impacts on the quality of life of citizens, employees and organizations. Over many years aspects and challenges of IQ have been studied within various contexts. As a result, the general approach to the study of IQ has offered numerous management and measurement approaches, IQ frameworks and list of IQ criteria. As the volume of data and information increases, IQ problems become pervasive. Whereas earlier studies investigated specific aspects of IQ, the next phase of IQ research will need to examine IQ in a wider context, thus its impact on the quality of life and societies. In this paper we apply an IQ oriented framework to two cases, cloud computing and lifelogging, illustrating the impact of IQ on the quality of life. The paper demonstrates the value of the framework, the impact IQ can have on the quality of life and in summary provides a foundation for further research.

abstract={Proper coding and transmission of medical and physiological data is a crucial issue for the effective deployment and performance of telemedicine services. This chapter presents a platform for performing proper medical content adaptation based on context awareness. Sensors are used in order to determine the status of a patient being monitored through a medical network. Additional contextual information regarding the patient's environment (e.g., location, data transmission device and underlying network conditions, etc.) is represented through an ontological knowledge base model. Rule-based evaluation determines proper content (i.e., biosignals, medical video and audio) coding and transmission of medical data, in order to optimize the telemedicine process. The paper discusses the design of the ontological model and provides an initial assessment. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Presented in this paper is the Patient Assessment-Data Quality Model (PA-DQM). It is designed to assess how patient datasets which are poor in composition can impact on the decision processes following patient assessment. The PA-DQM in particular examines four key Data Quality (DQ) dimensions: timeliness, accuracy, consistency and completeness. This DQ model is generic in nature as any number of decision making processes can be substituted to reflect the medical scenario under consideration. For example, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, Emergency Room (ER) triage systems or Modified Early Warning Scorecards (MEWS). The PA-DQM presented is evaluated using the MEWS process as an exemplar. Paper based MEWS are utilised to assist medical staff identify at risk patients with a declining health status. The calculated MEWS score is designed to trigger earlier medical interventions to avoid or reduce the potential impact of catastrophic events. In particular the existing MEWS system which (i.e. a paper based approach) is evaluated alongside an electronic- Modified Early Warning Scorecard (e-MEWS) system, which is designed and developed to reduce the number ofDQ issues which continue to persist with the paper based process. To validate the assertions presented in this paper a workshop (participation of 51 medical staff) was held in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, Ireland, where the paper based MEWS has been adopted for the last 3 years. It is clear from our initial findings that the proposed e- MEWS system has the ability to greatly enhance the levels of DQ over its existing paper based counterpart.},
