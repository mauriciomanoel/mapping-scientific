 title={Automatic Ocular Disease Screening and Monitoring Using a Hybrid Cloud System}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={263-268},   abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;image classification;Internet of Things;medical image processing;hybrid cloud system;healthcare IT systems;advanced image and data analysis techniques;medical devices;cloud-based system;advanced pattern classification algorithms;ophthalmologists;disease detection;ocular disease screening;Diseases;Cloud computing;Retina;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Internet of Things;healthcare;ocular diseases;disease screening;computer aided diagnosis;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.68},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={The constant rapid growth and development of modern medical technology has resulted in an ever-growing demand for higher quality health monitoring systems. This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;software defined networking;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;health monitoring systems;Internet of Things;e-healthcare sensor network load-balancing scheme;hospital remote-monitoring network planning;SDN-SFC;load-balancing mechanism;network congestion;hospital networks;relaying real-time information;remote medical sensors;Conferences;IEC;IEC Standards;Noise measurement;Cloud e-Healthcare;Wireless Body Area Network;Software-Defined Networking},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210833},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={Device-Free RF Human Body Fall Detection and Localization in Industrial Workplaces}, 
  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={2},   pages={351-362},   abstract={Fall detection and localization of human operators inside a workspace are major issues in ensuring a safe working environment. Recent research has shown that the perturbations of the radio-frequency (RF) signals commonly adopted for wireless communications can also be used as sensing tools for device-free human motion detection. Device-free RF-based human sensing applications range from tag-less body localization to detection and monitoring of human well-being (e-Health). In this paper, we propose a real-time system for human body motion sensing with special focus on joint body localization and fall detection. The proposed system continuously monitors and processes the RF signals emitted by industry-compliant radio devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and supporting machine-to-machine communication functions. Human-induced diffraction and multipath phenomena that affect RF signal propagation are leveraged for body localization while for fall detection a hidden Markov model is applied to discern different postures of the operator and to detect safety-relevant events by tracking the received signal strength indicator footprints. Fall detection performances are corroborated by extensive experimental measurements in different settings. In addition, we propose also a sensor fusion tool that is able to integrate the device-free RF-based sensing system within an industrial image sensors framework. Preliminary results, conducted during field trial measurements, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of localization accuracy, and sensitivity/specificity to correctly detect a fall event from preimpact postures.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;hidden Markov models;image sensors;machine-to-machine communication;motion measurement;radiotelemetry;RSSI;sensor fusion;device-free human motion detection;field trial measurements;industrial image sensor framework;sensor fusion tool;received signal strength indicator footprint tracking;safety-relevant event detection;hidden Markov model;RF signal propagation;multipath phenomena;human-induced diffraction;machine-to-machine communication functions;ISM band;industry-compliant radio devices;real-time system;human well-being monitoring;human well-being detection;tag-less body localization;device-free RF-based human sensing applications;device-free human motion detection;wireless communications;safe working environment;industrial workplaces;device-free RF human body fall localization;device-free RF human body fall detection;frequency 2.4 GHz;Sensors;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Hidden Markov models;Cameras;Device-free fall detection;device-free localization;hidden Markov model;radio vision and sensor fusion},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2016.2624800},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

 title={Leveraging Unlabeled Data for Emotion Recognition With Enhanced Collaborative Semi-Supervised Learning}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={22196-22209},   abstract={One of the major obstacles that has to be faced when applying automatic emotion recognition to realistic human-machine interaction systems is the scarcity of labeled data for training a robust model. Motivated by this concern, this paper seeks to utmost exploit unlabeled data that are pervasively available in the real-world and easy to be collected, by means of novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches. Conventional SSL methods such as self-training, suffer from their inherent drawback of error accumulation, i.e., the samples that are misclassified by the system are continuously employed to train the model in the following learning iterations. To address this major issue, we first propose an enhanced learning strategy, by which we re-evaluate the previously automatically labeled samples in each learning iteration, in order to update the training set by correcting the mislabeled samples. We further exploit multiple modalities and models in the SSL system, by using collaborative SSL, where all modalities and models are considered simultaneously; samples are selected by means of minimizing the joint entropy. This strategy is supposed to not only improve the performance of the model for data annotation and consequently enhance the trustability of the automatically labeled data, but also to elevate the diversity of selected data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, we performed extensive experiments on the remote collaborative and affective database, which includes multimodal recordings of spontaneous affective interactions of dyads. The empirical results show that the proposed approaches significantly outperform recently well-established SSL methods.},   keywords={emotion recognition;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);realistic human-machine interaction systems;error accumulation;learning iteration;enhanced learning strategy;automatically labeled samples;mislabeled samples;multiple modalities;collaborative SSL;data annotation;automatically labeled data;selected data;remote collaborative;automatic emotion recognition;unlabeled data leveraging;enhanced collaborative semisupervised learning;Emotion recognition;Data models;Training;Predictive models;Semisupervised learning;Entropy;Collaboration;Enhanced semi-supervised learning;collaborative learning;audiovisual emotion recognition},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2821192},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

More and more mobile end devices require a high data rate connection e.g. to a smart home (Internet of Things, IoT) or to the internet. The radiation power pattern of base stations and mobile end devices will completely change for the 5G technology. Therefore the electromagnetic exposure especially to human body will increase in the future, because most of the wireless connections are realized in RF technology. In this contribution two different measurement setups are presented. The first shows the electromagnetic radiation regarding a base station powered by a mobile phone provider over a timespan of a number of days. The second figures out the electromagnetic radiation of a handheld mobile end device to a human head in an area with very poor reception values. The results of those measurements where compared with legal and health limits. All measured and calculated results regarding the base stations were within the legal exposure limits. The calculated legal exposure limits of mobile devices were exceeded twice in areas within very poor reception values.

In many of these applications, device size and battery life are of critical importance. Since radios often consume a significant portion of the power budget in small sensing nodes [1], reducing radio power consumption is an effective way to decrease battery size or increase battery life. Reducing radio power consumption can be challenging as there are important tradeoffs between power consumption and performance metrics such as radiated output power, linearity, sensitivity, channelization capabilities, and interference sensitivity. Low-power radio designs often sacrifice one or more of these metrics in the pursuit of low overall power consumption.},   keywords={radio transmitters;narrowband transmitters;ultralow power design;integrated radio design;wearable health care;Internet of Things devices;structural integrity monitors;power budget;Frequency shift keying;Power generation;Phase locked loops;Radio transmitters;Power demand;Narrowband;Low power electronics},   doi={10.1109/MMM.2015.2390111},   ISSN={1527-3342},   month={April},}

The cost savings for such applications can go up to 67%. Additional intermediate layer DCs close to the root DC can be marginally cost beneficial for the compute intensive applications with medium or low demand locality. Hence, a Telecom Network Operator should start building an edge DC first having capacity up to hundreds of servers at the network edge to cater the emerging bandwidth-hungry applications and to minimize its operational cost.},   keywords={computer centres;mobile computing;operational cost minimization;telecom network operator;root DC;edge layer DC;IoT;Internet-of-things;health care;future bandwidth-hungry applications;congestion reduction;MEN infrastructure;mobile edge network infrastructure;intermediate layer data centers;Computational modeling;Bandwidth;Network topology;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Topology;Servers;Application Placement;Cost Optimization;Infrastructure Resource Placement;Mobile Edge Computing;Fog Computing},   doi={10.1109/FAS-W.2016.55},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.},   keywords={alarm systems;biomedical communication;Global Positioning System;gyroscopes;health care;patient monitoring;radiocommunication;sensors;smart phones;smartphones;healthcare;jogging;walking;travelling;standing;GPS coordinates;gyroscope;portable sensors;wireless communication;momentary state of health;fluid;calories;bodily position;ambulance;patient condition;GPS positions;life-saving information;driver indisposition;steering wheel;pedals;hazard warning flasher;measured data;pulse counter;sphygmograph;defibrillator;Smart phones;Sensors;Global Positioning System;Diseases;Vehicles;Fluids;Home appliances;smartphone;healthcare;save live},   doi={10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.90},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={64},   number={9},   pages={2624-2637},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the health-care sector through remote, continuous, and non-invasive monitoring of patients. However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.},   keywords={application specific integrated circuits;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;power aware computing;power consumption;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;cardiovascular diseases;Internet-of-Things;health-care sector;noninvasive patient monitoring;IoT-enabled medical devices;low-power ECG-processors;ultralow power;secure IoT sensing-preprocessing platform;ventricular arrhythmia;ECG signals;application specific integrated circuits;low power enhanced technology;chip-specific ECG;communication channel;thwarting hardware security;on-chip resources;multilayered security infrastructure;design-for-trust solution;Electrocardiography;Security;Hardware;Reverse engineering;System-on-chip;Integrated circuit modeling;ECG;biomedical classifier;ventricular arrythmia;Internet of Things;hardware security;design-for-trust},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2017.2694968},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={Sept},}

It is estimated that there will be 50 billion small-scale IoT devices by 2020. These devices, however, are extremely vulnerable to side-channel attacks, therefore low-cost, low-power defense methods are highly desirable. This paper presents an effective method for secure state encoding of finite-state machine (FSM) based controllers to defend against power analysis attacks. Given a user-defined graded security metric, we derive constrained state encoding for the FSM controllers to mitigate information leakage through the power side-channel, resulting in low-power designs. Experimental results using over 100 FSMs from BenGen and MCNC benchmark suites show a graded increase in encoding length (40-70% for restructured FSMs) depending on the level of security chosen.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={335-341},   abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1].

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={503-508},   abstract={In recent years, people with lifestyle-related diseases are increasing, because of lack of exercise, overeating, stress and smoking. With this situation, applications of Personal Computer (PC) or smart phone which support healthy life are widespread. Turning to the system dealing with meal information, there are two type systems. One is that meal records are inputted by hand and managed as meal logs. Another one is that a meal image is shot by a smart phone, and meal contents are recorded by image recognition. However, these systems need a lot of time for inputting of meal contents or shooting of meal images. Therefore, it is difficult to continue use. Moreover, the second system has a problem for accuracy of image recognition. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a meal information collection system which uses IoT wireless tags. An IoT wireless tag is corresponded to a meal and the system can automatically get meal information such as meal contents, meal sequence, meal time and so on. We implemented the meal information collection system which aims automatic collection and getting of various information which do not get at other systems. From the evaluation results of collection accuracy and comparison with conventional systems, we verified effectiveness of the proposed system.},   keywords={health care;image recognition;information systems;Internet of Things;mobile computing;smart phones;meal information collection system;Internet of Things;IoT wireless tag;smart phone;image recognition;health care;IoT;Meal information collection;Meal record;Health care;Sensor;Tag},   doi={10.1109/CISIS.2016.66},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed - such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

PHM big data has the characteristics of large-volume, diversity, and high-velocity. Effectively mining features from such data and accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the rotating components with new advanced methods become issues in PHM. Traditional data driven prognostics is based on shallow learning architectures, requires establishing explicit model equations and much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and prognostic expertise, and therefore is limited in the age of big data. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for RUL prediction of rotating components with big data. The presented approach is tested and validated using data collected from a gear test rig and bearing run-to-failure tests and compared with existing PHM methods.

People who have suffered from chronic diseases are needed to repeatedly monitor the vital signs periodically. The number of nurses in hospital is relative low compared to the number of patients in hospital, there may be a chance to miss to monitor any patient vital signs which may affect patient health. In this paper, real time monitoring vital signs of a patient is developed using wearable sensors.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={40128-40136},   abstract={One of the most important Internet of Things applications is the wireless body sensor network (WBSN), which can provide universal health care, disease prevention, and control. Due to large deployments of small scale smart sensors in WBSNs, security, and privacy guarantees (e.g., security and safety-critical data, sensitive private information) are becoming a challenging issue because these sensor nodes communicate using an open channel, i.e., Internet. We implement data integrity (to resist against malicious tampering) using the secure hash algorithm 3 (SHA-3) when smart sensors in WBSNs communicate with each other using the Internet. Due to the limited resources (i.e., storage, computation, and communication capabilities) of sensors in WBSNs, a lightweight implementation of SHA-3 is needed. To address this challenge, we propose a new implementation of the SHA-3, which has a compact hardware architecture. Our implementation of SHA-3 consists of a reliable logic structure, random access memory, and an enhanced finite state machine. The simulation on a Vitrtex-5 field programmable gate array shows that the proposed implementation is suitable for the WBSN on different applications. We evaluate the sensor area of the proposed SHA-3 implementation and compare it with other recently proposed hardware implementations of SHA-3. In addition, our hardware implementation approach reduces the area by almost 74.7% compared with the recently proposed hardware implementation which has the smallest area.},   keywords={body sensor networks;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;intelligent sensors;SHA-3 core;wireless body sensor network;WBSNs;secure hash algorithm 3;sensor area;SHA-3 implementation;hardware implementation approach;Internet of Things applications;Hardware;Security;Field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system security;Body sensor network;cryptographic hash function;encryption;FPGA;hardware;IoT;SHA-3;wireless},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2855408},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-10},   abstract={The emerging smart health and smart home applications require pervasive and non-intrusive human activity recognition and monitoring. Traditional technologies (e.g., using cameras or accelerometers and gyroscopes) may introduce privacy issues or require people to wear sensors. To address these issues, recent approaches exploit fine-grained wireless signals for activity recognition. However, these approaches require devices that are costly or need to provide unique wireless features (e.g., Doppler shifts or phase information). With the increasingly available Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in this paper, we propose Harmony, a human activity recognition and monitoring middleware which can utilize the coarse-grained (but pervasively available) received signal strength (RSS) measurements from the radios of IoT devices. We implement a complete evaluation platform (from data collection to data analysis) of the middleware on top of low cost ZigBee compliant MICAz nodes and a laptop. We also conducted extensive experiments. Our results show that our design can achieve similar accuracy as fine-grained WiFi channel state information (CSI) measurement-based approaches. Specifically, our overall human activities recognition accuracy is up to 74% and 90% for RSS readings from a single pair and 3 pairs of IoT devices, respectively.},   keywords={assisted living;computerised monitoring;Internet of Things;middleware;RSSI;wireless LAN;Zigbee;fine-grained WiFi CSI measurement-based approach;fine-grained WiFi channel state information measurement;low cost ZigBee compliant MICAz nodes;coarse-grained RSS measurements;coarse-grained received signal strength measurements;human activity recognition and monitoring middleware;Harmony middleware;Internet of Things;fine-grained wireless signals;privacy issues;nonintrusive human activity recognition;pervasive human activity recognition;smart home applications;smart health applications;IoT devices;coarse-grained received signal strength;Receivers;Monitoring;Middleware;ZigBee;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Wireless sensor networks},   doi={10.1109/ICNP.2016.7784414},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

We use the well-known mathematical convolution for the segments of the network. This methodology is applied using the simple definition of efficiency per segment. The first segment assumes the communication between nanosensor and intra-body device, whereas in the second one the intra-body device is engaged to the bio-cyber interface through the THz band. Others segments belong to the macroscopic scale but working in the MHz band. When the full QoS is estimated and assuming the most optimistic scenario, our crude estimation for the concrete case applied to nanomedicine has turned out to to be of order of 85%. In the other side, the lowest values of QoS would yield numbers below 50% by which the network might be running in those scenarios where traffic in cloud might degrade the IoBNT substantially.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cloud computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;nanosensors;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks;QoS;IoBNT;mathematical convolution;quality of service;Internet of Bio-Nano Things;intrabody device;biocyber interface;nanosensor;Quality of service;Convolution;Kidney;Nanoscale devices;Estimation;Nanomedicine;QoS;IoBNT;THz-emission},   doi={10.1109/INTERCON.2017.8079655},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;ultralow-power design;battery-operated wearable devices;energy supply;hardware resources;biosignal compressor;compression technique;Huffman table;wireless communication;wearable device energy consumption;Electrocardiography;Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Monitoring;Encoding;Histograms;Biomedical Healthcare;Wearable Devices;Approximate Computing;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT},   doi={10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Wireless body area network, which as a low-cost, convenient and easy to use health monitoring system is being widely researched and now it has gained very large advancement. In this paper, we introduced the design and development of a wireless router which also integrated atmospheric Pressure, Humidity and Temperature (P-H-T) sensing functions for the body area network to relay different kinds of physiological signals from a comparatively further place. The standout advantages of the wireless router we designed can be summarized as the following 4 points: 1. High network throughput rate: the network throughput rate could be as high as 73.6Kbytes/s when the data transmitted through three jumps; 2. Low packet loss rate: the packet loss rate is just 0.4% when date transmitted 50 meters through three jumps; 3. High transmission power: to enhance the wireless communication capability, wireless power amplifier is applied and the transmission power of the router can be up to 20dBm; 4. Multi-functions: besides the relay function, the router could also perform the P-H-T environment monitoring function. In this paper, we mainly introduced the design and implementation of the zigbee router, and then we described the experiments done on the network performance and the health and environment monitoring function. The designed zigbee router could also be used in other many applications such as elderly activity monitoring of the community, the forest fire detection, and so on.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;humidity measurement;patient monitoring;power amplifiers;pressure measurement;telecommunication network routing;temperature measurement;wireless ZigBee router;P-H-T sensing;health monitoring;aging population;wireless body area network;integrated atmospheric pressure-humidity-temperature sensing functions;physiological signals;transmission power;wireless communication capability;wireless power amplifier;relay function;P-H-T environment monitoring function;zigbee router;elderly activity monitoring;forest fire detection;Zigbee;Monitoring;Wireless communication;Throughput;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Temperature measurement;zigbee router; health monitoring; living environment monitoring; good network performance},   doi={10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.326},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Existing communication solutions are however limited in this respect, because of centralized application-level communication. In response to this, we presents a distributed communication solution for mHealth applications which circumvents these limitations. Our Internet-of-Things architecture enables mHealth applications to utilize information from sensors and wireless sensor networks via a peer-to-peer overlay, where sensor information is organized in an information model which is stored in the overlay itself. We present a proof-of-concept application and evaluation results regarding the architecture's real-time capabilities. The results indicate that a fully distributed architecture can support real-time sensing in mHealth applications and the support is available as an open source platform, MediaSense.

In this paper, we focus on IoT in monitoring mission which is widely used in every-day life, such as security surveillance, health-care, independent live, etc. In order to overcome the challenges of various viewpoints and heterogenous sensors in IoT, we propose a novel method named class-constrained transfer linear discriminant analysis (CTLDA), which learns two projection matrices with different dimensionality for mapping the original features into a common subspace. The target of learning two projection matrices is to maximize the inter-class data and minimize the intra-class data. Meanwhile, we propose the class-constrained regularization which enforces the neighboring samples with the same class to be still close to each other so as to further improve the discrimination of CTLDA. The class-constrained regularization possesses two strategies, i.e., hard constraint and soft constraint. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.},   keywords={Monitoring;Visualization;Wearable sensors;Internet of Things;Biomedical monitoring;Hidden Markov models;Internet of Things;application layer;LDA;action recognition},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2707518},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Many confront have yet to be addressed to create a dependable and flexible system for health care monitoring. In this paper Big data analytics on IoT based Health care system is proposed. IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework. Since the response time of the proposed system is less, it is suitable for real time alerting.},   keywords={Big Data;biosensors;cloud computing;data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;wearable computers;Big data analytics;IoT;health care monitoring system;Internet of Things;wearable biosensors;Internet of health sensor things;physicians concern;patients health information;Intel Galileo Gen 2;cloud computing;Hadoop;Big data;Bio sensors;Cloud;health care monitoring systems;Hadoop;IoT},   doi={10.1109/UPCON.2016.7894624},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

We designed Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity.

With such proliferation of the IoT/M2M, we have started to experience various smart services such as smart home, connected car, e-health, smart grid, etc. These IoT/M2M services are set to improve our life significantly. However, in IoT/M2M many things only exchange a small amount of data while generate a large amount of requests such as network connectivity requests, notification requests and storage requests. The traditional charging models such as those based on amount of data transfer are no longer adequate for M2M communications. As new charging factors and charging models are identified for M2M communications, a new charging architecture needs to be designed for M2M communications.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={13-24},   abstract={In a world deploying an Internet of Things, sensors and actuators are owned, accessed, and activated by a plethora of individuals and organizations. Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of "things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we "acquire" and "distribute" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions. The scheme puts users (including organizational entities) in the center of control over the access to their collections of sensory data. In our paper, we describe a deployment of these ideas for health care, smart cities, and autonomous cars.},   keywords={cryptography;Internet of Things;IoT users;Internet of Things;sensors;actuators;data aggregation;cloud computing;data acquisition;data distribution;user-centric multilevel multiple granularity mechanism;crypto currencies;Medical services;Organizations;Autonomous automobiles;Urban areas;Intelligent sensors;Data models;Internet of Things;Blockchain;Access Control;Capability-Based Security;Privacy Preserving},   doi={10.1109/IoTDI.2015.39},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

With the rapid development of the IoT ecosystem in a wide range of applications, IoT devices and data are going to be traded as commodities in the marketplace in the near future, similar to cloud services or physical objects. Developing such a trading platform has previously been identified as one of the key grand challenges in the integration of IoT and data science. Deployment of such a platform raises concerns about the security and privacy of data and devices since their ownership is hard to trace and manage without a central trusted authority. A central trusted authority is not a viable solution for a fully decentralized and distributed IoT ecosystem with a large number of distributed device vendors and consumers. Blockchain, as a decentralized system, removes the requirement for a trusted thirdparty by allowing participants to verify data correctness and ensure its immutability. IoT devices can use blockchain to register themselves and organize, store, and share streams of data effectively and reliably. We demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to IoT devices and data management with an aim of providing end-to-end trust for trading.

The day-by-day development of the Internet of Things causes a revolution in modern technology, which makes our life easier and automated. Due to a busy schedule and irregular lifestyle, health hazard is not an age-dependent factor in the recent era. Under these circumstances, Internet of Things has provided a much easier solution for remote real-time health monitoring of patients from the hospital as well as home. Sensors acquire the data of various parameters regarding patients' health, and the Internet of Things stores that data and displays through the website, which provides access for remote monitoring. Use of Sensor reduces the human error, and the size of the system reduces the occupied space of the room. The unique part of this proposed solution is the alarm generation to provide the prescribed medicine to the patient in time. The other beneficial area of the system is the scheme of sending the notification through email and SMS alert if any of the health parameters crosses the threshold value. Notification scheme will keep the respective authority conscious of the situation. Another significant area of the proposed solution is to create the optimum surroundings as per the requirement of patient's health condition.

Certain environments are proposed that are smart and self aware by direct communication between devices of various types that are part of the IoT. One category of devices such as the Low Power Lossy networks (LLNs) consists of numerous small sensors and low power devices as building block elements in IoT. The ROLL working group at Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT) has designed the Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) which is the core of the IoT protocol stack used for communication between these low-power devices. To our knowledge experimentation and evaluation of RPL is very much needed and not much done so far. A few simulation tools exist which enable evaluation of RPL for a realistic deployment scenario. This paper focuses on understanding of the architecture and protocol stack of RPL and thereby its place in IoT. The performance of RPL is carried out for a Smart Health environment scenario by the simulations done in the Contiki OS Cooja simulator with respect to the performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, latency, signalling overhead and energy consumption.

Intellectual deterioration, decreased psychomotor performance, behavior, and personality disorders are some of the consequences of OSA. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of this disorder is a critical need in healthcare solutions. There are several systems for OSA detection. Nevertheless, despite their promising results, these systems not guiding their treatment. For these reasons, this research presents an innovative system for both to detect and support of treatment of OSA of elderly people by monitoring multiple factors such as sleep environment, sleep status, physical activities, and physiological parameters as well as the use of open data available in smart cities. Our system architecture performs two types of processing. On the one hand, a pre-processing based on rules that enables the sending of real-time notifications to responsible for the care of elderly, in the event of an emergency situation. This pre-processing is essentially based on a fog computing approach implemented in a smart device operating at the edge of the network that additionally offers advanced interoperability services: technical, syntactic, and semantic. On the other hand, a batch data processing that enables a descriptive analysis that statistically details the behavior of the data and a predictive analysis for the development of services, such as predicting the least polluted place to perform outdoor activities. This processing uses big data tools on cloud computing. The performed experiments show a 93.3% of effectivity in the air quality index prediction to guide the OSA treatment. The system's performance has been evaluated in terms of latency. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the pre-processing of data at the edge of the network improves the efficiency of the system.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;open systems;patient monitoring;sleep;real-time monitoring;healthcare solutions;OSA detection;innovative system;elderly people;sleep environment;physical activities;physiological parameters;open data;smart cities;real-time notifications;fog computing approach;smart device operating;batch data processing;predictive analysis;outdoor activities;performed experiments;air quality index prediction;OSA treatment;smart system;sleep monitoring;integrating IoT;obtrusive sleep apnea;important sleep disorders;direct adverse impact;intellectual deterioration;personality disorders;Big Data tools;psychomotor performance;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Computer architecture;Big Data;Sensors;Internet-of-Things;big data;interoperability;sleep monitoring;health monitoring;open data;fog computing;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849822},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Application of internet of things (IoT) in health, defense, banking and other confidential information transfer urges the need for secure IoT. As most of the IoT devices are resource-limited (antennas, bandwidth, energy), securing the information transfer has always been a challenge. Looking at a solution for enhancing the security of single antenna, single carrier, energy efficient devices, we propose a novel scheme, channel-based mapping diversity (CBMD). This scheme uses the inherent randomness of the wireless channel and multiple mappings available for an M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) constellation in confusing an eavesdropper. When the legitimate and the eavesdropper channels are independent of each other, it is shown that a symbol error rate (SER) of M-1M is induced at the eavesdropper. Whereas, when the channels are correlated, optimal and sub-optimal strategies at source and eavesdropper are derived for their respective optimal performances. Further, a closed-form expression for a lower-bound on the SER at the eavesdropper is derived. Simulation results show that for the correlated case, as SNR at the eavesdropper increases, SER initially decreases, later saturates to a relatively high SER, hence making the job of the eavesdropper difficult in getting the legitimate data. Furthermore, the effect of the correlation is more pronounced on SER at higher levels of correlation. This indicates that for practical correlation scenarios, SER is high enough to confuse the eavesdropper.},   keywords={Phase shift keying;Internet of Things;Channel estimation;Sensor fusion;MIMO communication;Receivers;IoT;SER;diversity;physical layer security;correlated eavesdropper.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2842056},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={3076-3086},   abstract={The intelligent wearable heart rate measurement requirement has attracted more and more attention, and the related applications of Internet of Things are emerging. However, under intensive physical exercises, motion artifacts are strong interference sources for wrist-type photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor signals, thus significantly affecting the accurate estimation of heart rate and other physiological parameters. Currently, how to effectively remove the motion artifacts from PPG sensor signals is becoming an active and challenging research realm. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel spectral matrix decomposition (MC-SMD) model to accurately estimate heart rate in the presence of intensive physical activities. Motivated by the observation that the PPG signal spectrum and the acceleration spectrum have almost the same spectral peak positions in the frequency domain, we first model the removal of motion artifacts as a spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem. After removing motion artifacts, we propose a new spectral peak tracking method for estimating heart rate. Experimental results on the well-known PPG data sets recorded from 12 subjects during intensive movements demonstrate that MC-SMD can efficiently remove the motion artifacts and retrieve an accurate heart rate using multi-channel PPG sensor signals.},   keywords={cardiology;frequency-domain analysis;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;matrix decomposition;medical signal processing;optimisation;photoplethysmography;spectral matrix decomposition-based motion artifact removal;multichannel PPG sensor signal;intelligent wearable heart rate measurement;Internet of Things;wrist-type photoplethysmography sensor signal;heart rate estimation;physiological parameter;MC-SMD model;intensive physical activity;frequency domain;spectral peak position;spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem;spectral peak tracking method;Heart rate;Acceleration;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Estimation;Tracking;Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method;compressive sensing;heart rate measurement;photoplethysmography (PPG)},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2580594},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Deep Learning Based Approach for Bearing Fault Diagnosis}, 
  year={2017},   volume={53},   number={3},   pages={3057-3065},   abstract={Bearing is one of the most critical components in most electrical and power drives. Effective bearing fault diagnosis is important for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and operating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitoring systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals acquired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification performance on various bearing faults under different working conditions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the presented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds.},   keywords={acoustic signal processing;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);machine bearings;mechanical engineering computing;deep learning based approach;bearing fault diagnosis;sensor signal preprocessing;short-time Fourier transform;STFT;spectrum matrix;large memory storage retrieval;LAMSTAR neural network;acoustic emission signals;Fault diagnosis;Neurons;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Machinery;Big data;Signal processing;Acoustic emission (AE) sensor;bearing fault diagnosis;deep learning;large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network},   doi={10.1109/TIA.2017.2661250},   ISSN={0093-9994},   month={May},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2962-2965},   abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},   keywords={cardiology;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes;map reduce;large-scale dynamic network;Internet-of-hearts;sensing technology;mobile technology;smart connected healthcare;data analytics;mobile health system;disease pattern recognition;stochastic gradient descent approach;global network;network optimization;multiple processors;parallel computing;Parallel processing;Sensors;Program processors;Monitoring;Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Algorithms;Heart;Humans;Internet;Stochastic Processes;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351},   ISSN={1558-4615},   month={Aug},}

The new challenge will be to design, programme and implement highly distributed and connected digital technologies. These technologies will be embedded in a multitude of increasingly autonomous physical systems with various dynamics and satisfying multiple critical constraints including cost, security, safety, power efficiency, high performance, and size. This combination of various cyber-physical systems gives rise to emergent properties and unpredictable behaviours. In the future world of Cyber Physical Systems, a significant number of devices connected to the physical world will be able to exchange data with each other, access web services, and interact with people. Thanks to the development of the IoT and of high speed broadband, this embedded world will then meet the internet world and the physical world will meet the cyber world. The purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive view on Cyber-Physical Systems and Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) focusing on the convergence of these technologies and research thrusts that underpin “Smart Cities” and the Internet of Things concepts. Moreover as a practical example of CPS and BASN, a research project that aims at the development of a Smart and Safe Wearable System for Hand Pattern Recognition is presented.

This paper proposes a novel explicative classification approach featuring interpretable and explainable models. For this purpose, we embed a framework for building rule-based classifiers using class association rules. For evaluation, we apply two real-world datasets: One collected in the domain of personalized health using wearable sensors (accelerometers), the second one utilizing smartphone sensors for activity recognition.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which focuses on the spectrum allocation for multiple WBANs. We borrow the concepts of cell and cluster from cellular networks to allocate the channels for different WBANs. The clustering is self-organized to improve the data transmission for intra-WBAN communication by the information exchange via inter-WBAN communication. Additionally, based on the cluster architecture, an inter-WBAN relaying (IWR) protocol for packets with low privacy or high reliability is also investigated. The simulation results show that SDC has better signal to interference ratio compared with existing framework. Besides, SDC and IWR also provide better QoS performance in terms of higher data packet delivery ratio and lower packet delay.},   keywords={Wireless communication;Body area networks;Quality of service;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Interference;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Clustering;Interference mitigation;Spectrum allocation;WBAN.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2869829},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={475-480},   abstract={The US healthcare Affordable Care Act established the 30 day readmission protection program as one of the base lines of measuring quality of care at hospitals and post discharge. With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.},   keywords={cloud computing;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient care;risk analysis;data availability;loT enabled cloud based e-health;US healthcare affordable care act;30 day readmission protection program;care quality;hospitals;post discharge;reduced payment penalties;post discharge care;proactive care;risk patterns;Internet of things;readmission avoidance efforts;e-health architecture;healthcare outcomes;data unavailability;compromised data;Context;Electronic mail;Wide area networks;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Sensors;Collaboration;Cloud;Management;Internet of things;e-health;Predictive Analytics;Sensors;Policy;M2M;30 day readmission},   doi={10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257621},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

However, the unclear benefits of RFID and great risk make investors quite hesitant to invest in this disruptive and innovative technology. Prior research had employed the event study method to examine the short term market reaction of RFID adoption and found significant positive abnormal return. But whether RFID adoption can payback in the long run has not been addressed. In this paper, we extend previous research by using the ROA (Return on Assets) method to analyze the impact of RFID adoption on firm market value. We selected 74 publicly traded companies which were RFID adopters and there are altogether 108 adoption announcements ranging from 1997 to 2009. Then Pair T test of ROA had been conducted for each publicly traded company and its matching company. Other potential confounding factors are also considered such as the type of industry, timing of adoption, country, and firm characteristics such as level of diversification, financial health and growth potential. Altogether, there is no significant difference between RFID adopters and RFID non-adopters. Our result indicates that RFID's firm value has not been fully reflected in the long run. This may be attributed to its high cost and other uncertainties. The research in our paper may provide practical and academic implications.},   keywords={Internet of Things;investment;radiofrequency identification;radiofrequency identification;RFID adoption;return on assets;ROA;Internet of Things;firm market value;Radiofrequency identification;Companies;Industries;Internet of Things;Distance measurement;Timing;Uncertainty;RFID;ROA;market value;long term;firm characteristics},   doi={10.1109/ICSSSM.2014.6943348},   ISSN={2161-1890},   month={June},}

In this article, we present IAAS, a smart indoor anti-collision system based on RFID, which identifies and tracks passive RFID tags by analyzing the received backscatter signals. We extract RSSI based on the LWLR algorithm and phase profiles as fingerprints to help the user guide from obstacles without observations of eyes. Experiments are conducted to verify our system, and results show that IAAS could achieve high accuracy of 94 percent in obstacle avoidance.},   keywords={alarm systems;cloud computing;collision avoidance;data privacy;diseases;handicapped aids;health care;patient care;radiofrequency identification;sensors;high-quality patient care;visually impaired people;smart technologies;smart indoor anti-collision system;indoor anti-collision alarm system;smart healthcare;RFID;LWLR algorithm;IAAS;privacy disclosure;Antennas;Backscatter;Antenna measurements;Medical services;RFID tags;Wearable computers;Alarm systems;Patient monitoring},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700706},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={APRIL},}

Nevertheless, the high-power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements if not equipped with backscattering technologies such as RFID. This work shows how a quantum tunneling RFID tag enables the use of RFIDs in new applications by minimizing battery waste and by drastically improving the range of backscattering systems. The highly sensitive 5.8 GHz quantum tunneling RFID tag achieves backscattering free space ranges above 1.2 km while consuming biasing powers as low as 20.4 μW. This is over 10 times higher than the maximum range of a semi-passive 5.8 GHz RFID ideal link. The quantum tunneling tag is characterized by return gains as high as 35 dB, a simple RF front-end, a sensitivity of -84 dBm, and increasing SNRs for increasing RF impinging powers. This work lays out the basis for both entrepreneurial and research activities that will lead to a new class of long-range backscattering passive sensors with power consumption far lower than traditional radios.},   keywords={Internet of Things;quantum communication;radiofrequency identification;tunnelling;wireless sensor networks;backscattering communications;quantum tunneling RFID tag;sensor networks;radio-equipped drones;Internet of Things;IoT network;backscattering systems;SNR;power consumption;frequency 5.8 GHz;Backscatter;Radiofrequency identification;Tunneling;Antenna measurements;Voltage measurement;Modulation;Gain;RFID;reflection amplifier;tunnel diode;low powered RFID;modulation factor;quantum tunneling tag;quantum tunneling reflector},   doi={10.1109/RFID.2017.7945581},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

First, we instrument a smart environment with 28 different IoT devices spanning cameras, lights, plugs, motion sensors and health-monitors. We collect and synthesize traffic traces from this infrastructure for a period of 6 months, a subset of which we release as open data for the community to use. Second, we present insights into the underlying network traffic characteristics using statistical attributes such as activity cycles, port numbers, signalling patterns and cipher suites. Third, we develop a multi-stage machine-learning-based classification algorithm and demonstrate its ability to identify specific IoT devices with over 99%. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs between cost, speed, and performance involved in deploying the classification framework in real-time.

IoT has many applications in building smart cities, smart environment, e-health care, etc. Due to the presence of unreliable internet and new routing protocols for low-power devices, IoT requires innovative security solutions. In this paper, we present three new Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoT: 1) K-means clustering unsupervised learning based IDS; 2) decision tree based supervised IDS; and 3) a hybrid two stage IDS that combines K-means and decision tree learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first machine learning based IDSs (together called as ML-IDS) for IoT. All the three IDS are centralized and scalable approaches. The K-means approach achieves 70-93% detection rate for varying sizes of random IoT networks. Decision tree based IDS achieves 71-80% detection rate and the hybrid approach attains 71-75% detection rate for the same network sizes. Although the hybrid IDS obtains lower detection rate, it is more accurate than the other two approaches. The hybrid approach eliminates the false positives significantly, while the other two IDS suffer from a higher number of false positives. Similar results are also obtained for regular mesh, star and ring topologies of IoT networks, each comprising 16 nodes.},   keywords={computer network security;decision trees;Internet;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning;Intrusion Detection Systems;supervised IDS;machine learning;ML-IDS;low-power embedded devices;decision tree learning;wormhole attack detection;K-means clustering unsupervised learning;Internet of Things;IoT network security;Routing;Decision trees;Internet of Things;Security;Topology;Monitoring;Network topology;Internet of Things (IoT);security;machine learning;intrusion detection systems},   doi={10.1109/IntelliSys.2017.8324298},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

To this end, the IETF RoLL working group has designed the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This paper discusses the problems of link quality estimation and neighbor management policies when it comes to handling high densities.

With the introduction of Google Glass, Epson Moverio, Pebble, and Fitbit, wearables have certainly captured the attention of many consumers and enterprises. While some of these wearables mainly provide a single function, such as fitness tracking, health monitoring, and message display, others have taken on the integration of multiple functions in the same device; the BASIS watch, for example, combines time, fitness, and health-monitoring functions into a single device. According to a new market report published by Transparency Market Research, “Wearable Technology Market-Global Scenario, Trends, Industry Analysis, Size, Share and Forecast, 2012-2018,? the global wearable technology market is expected to grow from US$750 million in 2012 to US$5.8 billion in 2018. U.K.-based Juniper Research projects that the number of wearable devices shipped will rise from about 13 million in 2013 to 130 million in 2018, and the size of the market will jump from US$1.4 billion in 2013 to US$19 billion in 2018. Business Insider Intelligence projects shipments of 100 million units in 2014 and forecasts the market will ultimately be worth about US$12 billion per year. Such widely divergent forecasts by research firms are typical when industries are in their relative infancies and hypergrowth mode.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;market research;wearable computers;cloud computing;Internet of Things;wearables;DevCon;Google Glass;Epson Moverio;Pebble;Fitbit;transparency market research;Wearable computers;Internet of things;Biomedical monitoring;Cloud computing;Computer security;Business},   doi={10.1109/MCE.2014.2317895},   ISSN={2162-2248},   month={July},}

 title={Observing the Pulse of a City: A Smart City Framework for Real-time Discovery, Federation, and Aggregation of Data Streams}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={An increasing number of cities are confronted with challenges resulting from the rapid urbanisation and new demands that a rapidly growing digital economy imposes on current applications and information systems. Smart city applications enable city authorities to monitor, manage and provide plans for public resources and infrastructures in city environments, while offering citizens and businesses to develop and use intelligent services in cities. However, providing such smart city applications gives rise to several issues such as semantic heterogeneity and trustworthiness of data sources, and extracting up-to-date information in real time from large-scale dynamic data streams. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel framework with an efficient semantic data processing pipeline, allowing for real-time observation of the pulse of a city. The proposed framework enables efficient semantic integration of data streams and complex event processing on top of real-time data aggregation and quality analysis in a Semantic Web environment. To evaluate our system, we use real-time sensor observations that have been published via an open platform called Open Data Aarhus by the City of Aarhus. We examine the framework utilising Symbolic Aggregate Approximation to reduce the size of data streams, and perform quality analysis taking into account both single and multiple data streams. We also investigate the optimisation of the semantic data discovery and integration based on the proposed stream quality analysis and data aggregation techniques.},   keywords={Smart cities;Semantics;Real-time systems;Data aggregation;Internet of Things;Standards;Smart Cities;Internet of Things;Time Series Analysis;Complex Event Processing;Quality Analysis.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872606},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

These applications require multimedia (mainly video) flows to be handled by the underlying network in an efficient and scalable way, as they expect to consume a massive data produced by billions of things. In view of this, we propose a dynamic multiuser session control plane which leverages 5G's support of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate to advance beyond todays limited, per-flow IP-based communication systems. We handle such limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol architecture that exploits SDN to offload the flow streaming computation operations from the IoT cloud platform to the network edge, affording high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloudified system. CLASSICO dynamically builds Application Layer multiuser data sessions and maps them into enhanced group-enabled data paths featuring SDN replication at branching nodes. We applied our solution to multimedia-alike use case, and results show that CLASSICO outperforms typical SDN-enabled IoT systems in terms to Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video metrics.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet;Internet of Things;IP networks;software defined networking;dynamic multiuser session control plane;per-flow IP-based communication systems;CLASSICO;computation operations;IoT cloud platform;network edge;scalability;data sessions;data paths;SDN replication;cloud computing;application layer;cross-layer multiuser session control;improved SDN cloud communications;latency critical applications;software-defined networking substrate;cross-layer SDN session control architecture;quality of service video metric;quality of experience video metric;Cloud computing;Quality of service;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Computer architecture;Quality of experience;Cloud Computing;Internet of Things;Software Defined Networking;Cross-layer control plane},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390400},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

They are finding a wide range of applications in various domains, such as health-care, environmental monitoring, etc. In future, WSNs are expected to be integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT). The integrity of the sensed data is of primary importance in WSN and IoT applications. However, WSN platforms always have very limited resources in terms of battery power, computing and memory. Therefore, it is a key challenge to design an energy-friendly, lightweight digital signature algorithm for WSN platforms. In this paper, we present precomputation methods for Unbalanced Oil-Vinegar (UOV) signature scheme by exploiting the energy harvesting capabilities of WSN to enhance the performance of UOV signature. In addition, we combine circulant method with precomputation in UOV signature to further reduce the energy cost. Meanwhile, circulant method reduces the size and the memory overhead of the precomputation tuple. This increases the availability of precomputation and greatly enhances the availability of the overflow energy. By integrating the above optimization methods, the cost of UOV signature in a WSN node can be reduced by 93%. This greatly enhances the performance of UOV signature, making it feasible for the practical deployment on resource-constrained wireless sensor platforms.},   keywords={Wireless sensor networks;Oils;Sensors;Energy harvesting;Matrices;Digital signatures;Energy harvesting;UOV;Precomputation;IoT and WSNs security},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873288},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

At the same time, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded system combine IoT devices are widely used and making computing truly ubiquitous. Although bicycles have various functions, they fail to provide cyclists with sufficient exercise-related information and post-exercise analysis. Therefore, this paper introduced a bicycle record system of ground conditions based on IoT which is combining smartphone and embedded system. The event data recorder comprised two parts, a “smartphone-based event data recorder”and “bicycle-based real-time information feedback system". Using the event data recorder, this paper integrated and provided various types of real-time information for cyclists while they cycled to help them achieve their desired exercise results. After cycling, the cyclists could view cycling-related information through software analysis. This information included cycling routes taken, total cycling distance, and total calories burned. The event data recorder also saved information related to cycling routes, such as acceleration, deceleration, directional changes, and slope changes. By analyzing the recorded information, cyclists not only gained further insight into their exercise results but were also able to share cycling-related information through the Internet, which would benefit cyclists who had not cycled along this route before. By developing the bicycle record system, this paper aimed to provide cyclists with real-time, accurate, and complete information, enabling them to enjoy a consummate cycling environment.},   keywords={bicycles;data recording;embedded systems;health care;information systems;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;program diagnostics;radionavigation;smart phones;sport;ground conditions;IoT devices;cyclists;post-exercise analysis;embedded system;cycling routes;total cycling distance;complete information;Internet of Things;real-time bicycle record system;urban sports;exercise-related information;smartphone-based event data recorder;bicycle-based real-time information feedback system;software analysis;ubiquitous computing;Real-time systems;Bicycles;Compass;Sensors;Global Positioning System;System integration;Embedded systems;Bicycles;Internet of Things;cellular phones;embedded software;event detector},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2740419},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Researchers have found critical vulnerabilities such as compromise of private health data, hackers monitoring private conversations via a baby monitor, compromise of a moving internet enabled car or shutting it down altogether while in motion. Attention to security is not increasing at the same rapid pace as the number of IoT devices. Hence, security is beginning to be a major concern with the advent of IoT, connecting numerous devices introducing new attack vectors. This paper is intended to focus on the benefits of integrating security in IoT. The paper begins with design and implementation of a basic Health Monitor for remote monitoring and tracking of pulse rate and body temperature of patients treated in hospitals. While developing the Health Monitor, security is integrated in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). This integration intends to demonstrate identification and mitigation of the critical known security vulnerabilities thereby producing a much secure end product. Additional security assurance is provided by testing the IoT Health Monitor for applicable five of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 IoT vulnerabilities: (1) Insecure Web Interface, (2) Insufficient Authentication/Authorization, (3) Lack of Transport Encryption, (4) Privacy Concerns, and (5) Insufficient Security Configurability.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;fuzzy logic;health care;Internet of Things;pacemakers;patient monitoring;telemetry;thermometers;Remote Digital Blood Pressure;energy issues;energy consumption;data transmission;monitoring fever body temperature;HI-Thermo;adaptive system;fuzzy logic;Hi-Thermo;fever body temperature monitoring;existing traditional monitoring;energy efficient IoT;fever monitoring;Information Communication Technology;health services;digital systems;WIFI digital thermometer;Telemetry Digital Pacemaker;HI;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Testing;Healthcare;Monitoring;Digital;Logic fuzzy;Thermometer;IoT},   doi={10.1109/ICoICT.2017.8074640},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={45-52},   abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},   keywords={backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;artificial neural network-based approach;chronic disease prediction model;population aging;Internet of Things;IoT technology;healthcare technology;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;cardiovascular diseases;quality of life improvement;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;ANN;binary logistic regression model;behavior risk factor surveillance system;BRFSS;multilayer perception neural network model;MLP neural network model;back propagation;BP algorithm;area under the receiver-operator curve;AUC;Hypertension;Diseases;Predictive models;Logistics;Artificial neural networks;Analytical models;Regression analysis;logistic regression;artifical neural network;hypertension prediction},   doi={10.1109/iThings.2014.16},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

We consider the fact that embedded devices are designed by reusing IP cores with reconfigurable scan network (RSN) as the standard testing facility and propose to generate unique integrated circuit (IC) identifications (IDs) based on different configurations for the RSN. These circuit IDs not only solve the IC and device identification and authentication problems, they can also be considered as a lightweight security primitive in other applications such as IC metering and IP fingerprinting.

Exploiting the social relationship link between healthcare user (e.g., patients and elderly people) and healthcare provider (e.g., physicians), social networks can play the role of a trusted online platform to establish service application interfaces between healthcare user (HU) and healthcare provider (HP). This enables the Internet of things (IoT) medical devices (e.g., IoT body sensor) to timely share the bio-data of HU with remote HP via the both storage-rich and computational resource-rich social networks. Given the high security requirement on SIoT data sharing and the fact that resource-constrained IoT devices cannot efficiently execute complicated cryptography, a robust and cost-effective two-phase security method is proposed by exploiting the device-specific physical-layer (PHY) attributes. Specifically, the PHY carrier frequency offset and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance of an IoT device are practically estimated to generate the PHY-ID. Using our PHY-ID, the SIoT HU authentication and the bio-data confidentiality are simultaneously enhanced without posing any additional implementation overhead at IoT body sensors, which is especially applicable for the resource-constrained IoT devices.},   keywords={body sensor networks;computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;social networking (online);bio-data confidentiality;IoT body sensor;PHY-aided secure IoT healthcare system;social relationship link;healthcare user;healthcare provider;trusted online platform;service application interfaces;remote HP;computational resource-rich social networks;SIoT data sharing;novel physical-layer-aided security technique;social Internet of things architecture-based healthcare system;Internet of things medical devices;storage-rich social networks;device-specific physical layer attributes;PHY carrier frequency offset;SIoT HU authentication;PHY-ID;in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance;two-phase security method;resource-constrained IoT devices;Medical services;Estimation;Social network services;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288341},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Fault detection methods of solenoid valves play important role for improving their reliability and maintenance efficiency due to their high failure rates in the field. Therefore, a novel method of fault detection for solenoid valves based on vibration signal measurement is proposed in this paper. The vibration sensor is place on the top of the solenoid valve and the vibration signal is collected by Labview SignalExpress system. The amplitude of the signal is extracted by denoising algorithm based on Wavelet and analyzed to detect the working state with the help of health index. The method is not interfered by the power supply system, and the method enhance the ability to resist interference.

This survey provides a comprehensive review of such enabling technologies. In particular, we present cellular localization systems including recent results on 5G localization, and solutions based on Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), highlighting those that are capable of computing 3D location in multi-floor indoor environments. We overview range-free localization schemes, which have been traditionally explored in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and are nowadays gaining attention for several envisioned Internet of Things (IoT) applications. We also present user mobility estimation techniques, particularly those applicable in cellular networks, that can improve localization and tracking accuracy. Regarding the mapping of physical space inside buildings for aiding tracking and navigation applications, we study recent advances and focus on smartphone-based indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches.

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={3},   pages={2130-2145},   abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things and cloud computing technologies, smart health (s-health) is expected to significantly improve the quality of health care. However, data security and user privacy concerns in s-health have not been adequately addressed. As a well-received solution to realize fine-grained access control, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has the potential to ensure data security in s-health. Nevertheless, direct adoption of the traditional CP-ABE in s-health suffers two flaws. For one thing, access policies are in cleartext form and reveal sensitive health-related information in the encrypted s-health records (SHRs). For another, it usually supports small attribute universe, which places an undesirable limitation on practical deployments of CP-ABE because the size of its public parameters grows linearly with the size of the universe. To address these problems, we introduce PASH, a privacy-aware s-health access control system, in which the key ingredient is a large universe CP-ABE with access policies partially hidden. In PASH, attribute values of access policies are hidden in encrypted SHRs and only attribute names are revealed. In fact, attribute values carry much more sensitive information than generic attribute names. Particularly, PASH realizes an efficient SHR decryption test which needs a small number of bilinear pairings. The attribute universe can be exponentially large and the size of public parameters is small and constant. Our security analysis indicates that PASH is fully secure in the standard model.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={A generic sensor network architecture is developed, combining Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) concepts. Distributed sensor nodes consist of a local controller (Raspberry-Pi board), to pre-process and format data collected from several sensors, and an Ethernet and power management circuit, to interface with PoE-enabled Ethernet ports. The system design follows a client-server architecture: by combining PoE with the IoT, the endpoint clients and servers (PoE controller modules) can communicate in local area network using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Clients can send commands to observe sensor data, change data acquisition sampling rate, and post new sensor resources. As data gets observed by clients, it can be further stored in a custom-designed HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) file format, for post-processing, visualization and data management. The convergence of data and power flow control enables a smart power management at the network level - most of the sensor nodes will be powered-up (awoken) only after custom triggering events detected by a main subset of always-on sensing nodes. These PoE controller modules are intended for structural and environment monitoring in one of the tallest wooden tower in the world, to be built in UBC campus. The generic architecture may be further adopted in the future for other types of applications, like environmental monitoring or human health.},   keywords={client-server systems;data acquisition;Internet of Things;load flow control;local area networks;microcomputers;power aware computing;protocols;wireless sensor networks;generic sensor network architecture;power-over-Ethernet concept;Internet-of-things concept;IoT;distributed sensor nodes;local controller;Raspberry-Pi board;power management circuit;PoE-enabled Ethernet ports;client-server architecture;local area network;constrained application protocol;CoAP;data acquisition sampling rate;post new sensor resources;HDF5 file format;hierarchical data format 5 file format;data flow control;power flow control;smart power management;network level;always-on sensing nodes;UBC campus;Data visualization;Protocols;Servers;Metadata;Computers;Control systems;Copper;Sensor Network;Power-over-Ethernet;HDF5;Smart Power Management;Raspberry Pi},   doi={10.1109/IEMCON.2015.7344442},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={208-215},   abstract={Roadway safety is a serious public health issue. Vehicle crashes on the roads and highways cost loss of lives and damages to properties. Technology exists today to help identify and respond quickly to crashes, which is specially critical in rural areas. A feature that enables a car to warn its driver against an eminent crash or to recommend the proper speed based on traffic and weather conditions is much needed in today's Internet of Things (IoT) era. Connected Vehicle (CV) technologies are contributing towards fulfilling this need. In this paper, we present a safety driving system through a cooperative hazard awareness and avoidance (CHAA) system based on V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communications. Our approach is based on DSRC-based V2V communications. It aims to alert drivers and recommend the proper speeds for vehicles that are approaching a hazardous zone due, for instance, to low visibility conditions. We also validate the proposed hazard alert and speed recommender system under various scenarios through simulations using the iTetris platform and SUMO simulator and we demonstrate its outperformance, compared to a regular environment, in terms of risk reduction and road safety efficiency. To this end, we have adapted iTetris by updating some of its existing features (like the Geo-broadcast routing capability) which is another contribution of this paper.},   keywords={cooperative communication;Internet of Things;road safety;road traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks;connected vehicle technology;roadway safety;public health issue;vehicle crash;traffic conditions;weather conditions;Internet of Things;IoT;cooperative hazard awareness and avoidance system;CHAA system;V2I communication;vehicle-to-infrastructure communication;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;DSRC-based V2V communication;iTetris platform;risk reduction;Vehicle crash testing;Roads;Hazards;Wireless communication;Standards;Meteorology;CV;V2V;V2I;DSRC/WAVE;Road Safety;Road hazard;CHAA},   doi={10.1109/WAINA.2017.17},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

The sensor nodes in these applications need to transmit information data to personal station and receive control information from personal station to adjust working modes. However, unlike an easily rechargeable personal station, body sensor nodes suffer from energy shortages, which affect the nodes' lifetimes. To solve this problem, we design a novel medium access control (MAC) layer protocol to enhance the energy efficiency and extend the lifetime of body sensor nodes in WBANs. The proposed protocol utilizes a hybrid scheme by taking advantage of carrier-sense multiple accesses with the collision avoidance and time division multiple access schemes. In addition, we allocate the main transmission overhead at the personal station side and design a novel awaiting order state for sensor nodes to improve energy efficiency. Also, the analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol can provide a 6% to 15% decrease in energy consumption from other protocols.},   keywords={access protocols;body area networks;carrier sense multiple access;energy conservation;Internet of Things;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks;wireless body area networks MAC protocol;energy efficiency;sensor networks;health monitoring;body sensor nodes;energy shortages;carrier-sense multiple accesses;collision avoidance;time division multiple access schemes;energy consumption;WBAN;Internet of things;rechargeable personal station;medium access control layer protocol;Sensors;Body area networks;Time division multiple access;Wireless communication;Media Access Protocol;Energy efficiency;Sensor networks;wireless body area networks;sensor networks;MAC protocol;energy efficiency},   doi={10.1109/LSENS.2018.2795566},   ISSN={2475-1472},   month={March},}

In this paper, two accelerometers are mounted in the vertical and lateral direction of the axle-box and two different cases has been considered for simulation. The measured signal which is received from the accelerometer has been optimized using honey bee optimization (HBO) technique and the result is compared with conventional track geometry measurement system. The measured values are updated simultaneously in the cloud. The server manages this situation and sends the information to the control room.

While Blockchain technology is currently primarily deployed in crypto-currency systems like Bitcoin, the concept is also expected to emerge as a key component of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), enabling novel applications in digital health, smart energy, asset tracking and smart transportation. As Blockchain networks evolve to industrial deployments with large numbers of geographically distributed nodes, the block transfer and processing delays arise as a critical issue which may create greater potential for forks and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Motivated by these issues, we develop stochastic network models to capture the Blockchain evolution and dynamics and analyze the impact of the block dissemination delay and hashing power of the member nodes on Blockchain performance in terms of the overall block generation rate and required computational power for launching a successful attack. The results provide useful insight in crucial design issues, e.g., how to adjust the ‘difficulty-of-work’ in the presence of delay so as to achieve a target block generation rate or appropriate level of immunity from adversarial attacks. We employ a combination of analytical calculations and simulation experiments to investigate both stationary and transient performance features, and demonstrate close agreement with measurements on a wide-area network testbed running the Ethereum protocol.},   keywords={Delays;Peer-to-peer computing;Analytical models;Stochastic processes;Bitcoin},   doi={10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485982},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Due to the many beneficial effects on physical and mental health and strong association with many fitness and rehabilitation programs, physical activity (PA) recognition has been considered as a key paradigm for internet of things (IoT) healthcare. Traditional PA recognition techniques focus on repeated aerobic exercises or stationary PA. As a crucial indicator in human health, it covers a range of bodily movement from aerobics to anaerobic that may all bring health benefits. However, existing PA recognition approaches are mostly designed for specific scenarios and often lack extensibility for application in other areas, thereby limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we attempt to detect more gym physical activities (GPAs) in addition to traditional PA using acceleration, A two layer recognition framework is proposed that can classify aerobic, sedentary and free weight activities, count repetitions and sets for the free weight exercises, and in the meantime, measure quantities of repetitions and sets for free weight activities. In the first layer, a one-class SVM (OC-SVM) is applied to coarsely classify free weight and non-free weight activities. In the second layer, a neural network (NN) is utilized for aerobic and sedentary activities recognition; a hidden Markov model (HMM) is to provide a further classification in free weight activities. The performance of the framework was tested on 10 healthy subjects (age: 30 &amp;#x00B1; 5; BMI: 25 &amp;#x00B1; 5.5 kg/m2; body fat: 20.5 &amp;#x00B1; 5.4), and compared with some typical classifiers. The results indicate the proposed framework has better performance in recognizing and measuring GPAs than other approaches. The potential of this framework can be extended in supporting more types of PA recognition in complex applications.},   keywords={Training;Hidden Markov models;Activity recognition;Internet of Things;Artificial neural networks;Medical services;Support vector machines;Internet of things;physical activity recognition;free weight training;wearable sensors.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846359},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

System responsiveness, robustness and energy efficiency are considered and modelled. Based on system requirements and functions, several modules are designed, including filtering, impact detecting, local processing and wireless communicating modules. The system was implemented on a printed circuit board. The response time is about 12 us with an average current lower than 1 mA when the impact activity is lower than 0.1%.

However, its high integration has not been achieved yet owing to a difficulty in downscaling of the memory cell including one transistor and one capacitor. One of the solutions to realize the very small capacitors is the employment of multi-shell nanowires (NWs) including ferroelectrics. We have already established fabrication process of ferroelectric NWs/nanotubes by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using conductive ZnO NWs as a template. Hence, we have proposed the introduction of ZnO/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnO NW capacitors into FeRAM memory cells using HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a ferroelectric. In this study, we focus on the crystallization of HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers on ZnO NW. ZnO NWs used as a template for NW capacitors were grown on Pt-covered SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si substrate by MOCVD using Zn(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a precursor and oxidizing gas, respectively.

Furthermore, the proximity of fog/edge devices to where the data is produced makes it stand-out in terms of resource allocation, service delivery, and privacy. From the business perspective, FECIoT will lead to a boom and spring up of small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), thereby encouraging inclusion for all. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art IoT literature over the period 2008-2018 and propose the FECIoT framework which covers the enabling technologies, services, and open research issues.

Furthermore, the vast amount of the sensory data and the rapid proliferation of the smart devices (i.e. sensors) make a new approach regarding efficient data collection and storage inevitable. Fog Computing (FC) is an environment where data are stored and pre-processed before transmitting them to the cloud, having a number of advantages like scalable real-time services, fault detection and isolation, enhanced security and privacy, etc. In this work, we present a fog-enabled IoT platform used for sensory data collection, presenting several metrics that can be used as the basis for a Management-Platform-as-a-Service, able to efficiently monitor the IoT platform and predict potential failures.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer network reliability;Internet of Things;Fog-enabled IoT platform;Internet-of-Things;platform management-related issues;smart devices;fog computing;FC;data storage;sensory data collection;management-Platform-as-a-Service;potential failure prediction;Temperature sensors;Computer architecture;Performance evaluation;Security;Cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/CAMAD.2017.8031527},   ISSN={2378-4873},   month={June},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={269-274},   abstract={Smart health home systems and assisted living architectures rely on severely energy-constrained sensing devices, such as wearable sensors, for the generation of data and their reliable wireless communication to a central location. However, the need for recharging the battery regularly constitutes a maintenance burden that hinders the long-term cost-effectiveness of these systems, especially for health-oriented applications that target people in need, such as the elderly or the chronically ill. These sensing systems generate raw data that is processed into knowledge by reasoning and machine learning algorithms. This paper investigates the benefits of embedded machine learning, i.e. executing this knowledge extraction on the wearable sensor, instead of communicating abundant raw data over the low power network. Focusing on a simple classification task and using an accelerometer-based wearable sensor, we demonstrate that embedded machine learning has the potential to reduce the radio and processor duty cycle by several orders of magnitude; and, thus, substantially extend the battery lifetime of resource-constrained wearable sensors.},   keywords={accelerometers;body sensor networks;home computing;learning (artificial intelligence);patient monitoring;pattern classification;wearable computers;wireless sensor networks;embedded machine learning;smart health home systems;severely energy-constrained sensing devices;sensing systems;reasoning;machine learning algorithms;abundant raw data;wireless communication;wearable sensor battery lifetime;health-oriented applications;knowledge extraction;low power network;Wearable sensors;Machine learning;Acceleration;Batteries;Data mining;Monitoring;Wearable systems;Embedded Machine Learning;eHealth;Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355116},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

In the view of ever increasing sources of toxic chemicals, these systems should have the facilities to detect and calibrate the source quickly. Toxic gases are the ones that cause health impact but humans are being exposed to it in various situations. These gases have to be monitored such that increase in the normal level of them could be known and proper precaution measures can be undertaken. So, an embedded system is designed using a microcontroller with internet of things, for the purpose of detecting and monitoring the hazardous gas leakage, which aids in the evasion of endangering of human lives. The hazardous gases can be sensed and displayed each and every second, in proximity to one more sensor for tracking heart beats which help to monitor the condition of the sewer labourers. If both the gases along with a pulse detector exceeds the normal level then an alarm is generated immediately and also an alert warning message can be sent to the authorised administrator and as well to the nearest health center to make the sewer labourers feel comfortable with necessary first aid and possibilities with the treatment in the case of emergency. Once the message is received by the health center, they enforce their team with necessary first aid to the current location to save the sewer labourer. Once this system is established for a particular user this will completely become fully automated and does not need any other additional people for monitoring and alerting purpose. It has an advantage over the manual method in offering quick response time and accurate detection of an emergency.},   keywords={gas sensors;wireless sensor networks;biomedical measurement;personnel;health hazards;industrial accidents;wireless sensing system;sewer labourer welfare;environmental pollution monitoring;toxic chemicals;toxic gases;microcontroller;internet of things;hazardous gases;heart beats;pulse detector;alert warning message;health center;first aid;fully automated;quick response time},   doi={10.1049/htl.2017.0017},   ISSN={2053-3713},   month={},}

Sleeping conditions are one of the most influential factors on health. However, the literature lacks of the appropriate simulation tools to widely support the research on the recognition of sleeping postures. This paper proposes an agent-based simulation framework to simulate sleeper movements on a simulated smart bed with load sensors. This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors. This simulator can also generate logs text files with big data for applying offline big data techniques on them. The source code of ABS-BedIoT and some examples of logs are freely available from a public research repository. The current approach is illustrated with an algorithm that properly recognized the simulated sleeping postures with an average accuracy of 98%. This accuracy is higher than the one reported by an existing alternative work in this area.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;power system simulation;sleep;smart power grids;internet-of-things;healthcare professionals;load sensors;sleeping posture recognition algorithms;ABS-BedIoT simulator;bed sensors;offline big data techniques;smart beds;Big data analytics;remotely monitor patients;agent-based simulation framework;Intelligent sensors;Big Data;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Agent-based-simulation;big data;Internet-of-Things;multi-agent systems;smart bed},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home's traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.},   keywords={computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;differential privacy framework;Internet traffic analysis;connected health;cyber-attack;user privacy;traffic analysis attack;smart home gateway;encrypted traffic;privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework;wirelessly connected smart homes;IoT devices;traffic flow;hostile smart community network;differential privacy mechanism;energy consumption;Internet of Things;strong differential privacy;industrial automation;machine learning algorithms;multihop routing protocols;source-destination unlinkability;Smart homes;Logic gates;Privacy;Cryptography;Smart cities;Routing;Bayesian inference;differential privacy;energy efficiency;Internet of Things (IoT);secure routing;traffic analysis attack},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2799820},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

The situation is considerably worse in developing nations, such as India. The average concentration of PM10 in Delhi has increased by over 66% between the years 2007 and 2010 and continues to increase further. Rising air pollution has been shown to have a detrimental effect on human health. The first line of action is to sensitize people about the problem by informing them about the quality of air that they are breathing in their immediate vicinity. Unfortunately, India still lacks the infrastructure required to measure pollution at a granular scale. Most of the pollution monitoring stations are placed in regions of low population density, and hence, it is difficult to calculate the personal exposure to air pollution for most of the population. It is also not economically viable to add pollution monitoring devices at such a scale in a short period of time. We propose a framework to estimate air pollution for a given locality by leveraging the existing infrastructure of monitoring stations and looking at factors, such as traffic conditions and greenery. We evaluate our framework by estimating the pollution exposure for long trips undertaken by users, given the seed pollution values at a few spots. Our framework incurs a reasonable accuracy.

As a promising networking paradigm, it is adopted to improve the healthcare services and create a highly reliable ubiquitous healthcare system. However, the flourish of WBANs still faces many challenges related to security and privacy preserving. In such pervasive environment where the context conditions dynamically and frequently change, context-aware solutions are needed to satisfy the users' changing needs. Therefore, it is essential to design an adaptive access control scheme that can simultaneously authorize and authenticate users while considering the dynamic context changes. In this paper, we propose a context-aware access control and anonymous authentication approach based on a secure and efficient Hybrid Certificateless Signcryption (H-CLSC) scheme. The proposed scheme combines the merits of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Signcryption (CP-ABSC) and Identity-Based Broadcast Signcryption (IBBSC) in order to satisfy the security requirements and provide an adaptive contextual privacy. From a security perspective, it achieves confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, context-aware privacy, public verifiability, and ciphertext authenticity. Moreover, the key escrow and public key certificate problems are solved through this mechanism. Performance analysis demonstrates the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to benchmark schemes in terms of functional security, storage, communication and computational cost.},   keywords={authorisation;body area networks;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;message authentication;mobile radio;telecommunication control;ubiquitous computing;context-aware authorization;wireless body area networks;wireless communications;healthcare services;adaptive access control scheme;context-aware access control;anonymous authentication approach;adaptive contextual privacy;context-aware privacy;ciphertext authenticity;WBAN;ubiquitous healthcare system;Internet of Things;hybrid certificateless signcryption;identity-based broadcast signcryption;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Authentication;Access control;Privacy;Public key},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422397},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

A topic that is being discussed is the M2M services in health sector. Utilization of M2M services in health sector is expected to help or improve existing health services. M2M technology connects machines, devices and equipment through various types of communication. This makes the device into a smart device that can communicate with each other. In this paper, we propose design of M2M communication system that are not only monitor the patient, but also can provide medical recommendations. The treatment can be monitored by doctor. In this system, there will be two devices and a mobile application. The first device is sphygmomanometer connected to the microcontroller, the second device is medicine box connected to the microcontroller, and a mobile application. With the design of the system of machine-to-machine (M2M) that we propose, this system is expected to help hypertension patients on their health recovery.},   keywords={blood;blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;diseases;health care;kidney;microcontrollers;patient monitoring;smart phones;telemedicine;renal failure;coronary heart disease;stroke;hypertension patients;smart device;M2M communication system;machine-to-machine;kidney failure;systolic blood pressure;diastolic blood pressure;brain damage;M2M services;medical recommendations;sphygmomanometer;microcontroller;medicine box;mobile application;Biomedical monitoring;Machine-to-machine communications;Blood pressure;Drugs;Mobile applications;Hypertension},   doi={10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108674},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The architecture of the platform extends the Internet of Things to a Web-centric paradigm through utilizing existing Web standards to access and control objects of the physical layer. This incorporates capillary networks, each of which encompasses a set of medical sensors linked wirelessly to a humanoid robot linked (via the Internet) to a Web-centric disease management hub. This provides a set of services for both patients and their caregivers that support the full continuum of the multidimensional care approach of diabetes. The platform's software architecture pattern enables the development of various applications without knowing low-level details of the platform. This is achieved through unifying the access interface and mechanism of handling service requests through a layered approach based on object virtualization and automatic service delivery. A fully functional prototype is developed, and its end-to-end functionality and acceptability are tested successfully through a clinician-led pilot study, providing evidence that both patients and caregivers are receptive to the introduction of the proposed platform.},   keywords={health care;humanoid robots;Internet of Things;medical robotics;robot assistant;diabetes management;children;Internet of Things;eHealth platform;humanoid robots;diabetes treatment;multidimensional care approach;Web-centric paradigm;Web standards;capillary networks;layered approach;object virtualization;automatic service delivery;Diabetes;Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics;Virtualization;Diabetes;eHealth;Internet of Things (IoT);multidimensional care;object virtualization;robot-assisted therapy},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2016.2623767},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={53-60},   abstract={In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;firewalls;health care;hospitals;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;wireless LAN;on-demand IoT device tunneling service;on-demand WebRTC service;WebRTC gateway service;ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic;local hospital network;local home network;tunnel sensor;medical devices;home-care deployments;hospital firewall;external machines;NAT;local WiFi network;VPN solutions;WebRTC traffic;concurrent streams;local gateway services;direct browser-to-browser connection;WebRTC;Logic gates;Browsers;Protocols;Hospitals;Ports (Computers);Standards;webrtc;rtc;palcom;iot;medical applications},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.19},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

An early-warning system for slope collapse and debris flow is essential to ensure safety of human beings and assets. Based on fiber optic sensing technology and Internet of Things, a new sensing transducer for internal earth pressure measurement in a soil slope is proposed, fabricated, and tested in this paper. The working principles, theoretical analysis, laboratory calibrations, and discussions of the proposed pressure transducers are elaborated. Extensive evaluations of the resolutions, physical properties, and response to the applied pressures have been performed through modeling and experimentations. The results show that the sensitivity of the designed pressure sensor is 0.1287 kPa/με across a pressure range of 140 kPa. Finally, a field soil slope was instrumented with the developed fiber optic sensors and other sensors. Through internet and cloud computing platform, the stability of the soil slope was analyzed. In the cloud computing platform, the numerical simulation is carried out by considering the slope internal deformations, rainfall infiltration, and limit force equilibrium. The factor of safety of the soil slope was calculated, which could be used to determine health condition of the instrumented slope. The performance was evaluated and classified into three categories. It proves that the proposed early-warning system has potential to monitor the health condition of the soil slopes.},   keywords={distributed sensors;fibre optic sensors;geotechnical engineering;mechanical stability;pressure measurement;pressure sensors;pressure transducers;soil;early-warning system;quasidistributed fiber optic sensor networks;slope failure;slope collapse;fiber optic sensing technology;internal earth pressure measurement;pressure transducers;field soil slope;cloud computing platform;slope internal deformations;instrumented slope;pressure sensor;fiber optic sensors;pressure 140.0 kPa;Optical fiber sensors;Soil;Cloud computing;Strain;Temperature sensors;Pressure sensors;Fiber optic sensor;Internet of Thing;cloud computing;early-warning system;slope},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2771494},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility.},   keywords={decision making;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;security of data;trusted computing;health IoT system;environmental health community;collective knowledge base;trust-based decision making;trust-based information sharing;trust-based health IoT protocol;Decision making;Protocols;Security;Internet of Things;Sensors;Reliability;Medical services;Decision trust;health Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);trust management;trust-based decision making},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2736446},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

Most of these devices are also connected to the Internet. However, the full capabilities of these devices are not fully harnessed and thus, they are not as intelligent as they could be. These devices, together with the Internet, can be used as “Internet of Things” where each device can be both producer and consumer of information. This framework is realizable in a real dynamic system if there is an intelligent distributed layer above it which can cater to services of all heterogeneous devices as required. The existing solutions to this problem are either too hardware dependent, or too abstract. In this paper we present a concept of this layer using mobile agents which makes the system flexible and dynamically adaptable. This layer has been deployed using a publicly available Prolog-based mobile agent emulator (however, any other mobile agent framework can also be used). The proposed approach is capable of updating information like availability and usability of services dynamically. It also has speech processing modules to provide solutions using voice-based commands and prompts. The prototype is scalable and robust to partial network failures. The implementation details and performance analysis of this work are reported and discussed. This framework can be used to deploy systems which can enable people to search for services like health facilities, food services, transportation, law and order using a common interface including voice commands.},   keywords={computer network reliability;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile agents;PROLOG;smart cities;speech processing;mobile agents-based IoT;smart city;Internet of Things;intelligent distributed layer;heterogeneous devices;dynamic adaptability;flexible system;Prolog-based mobile agent emulator;speech processing module;voice-based commands;voice-based prompts;partial network failure;Internet;Mobile agents;Cities and towns;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Fires;Internet of Things;Mobile Agents;Distributed System;Services;Smart City;IoT},   doi={10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019766},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

This paper presents a modular and extensible quadrotor architecture and its specific prototyping for automatic tracking applications. The architecture is extensible and based on off-the-shelf components for easy system prototyping. A target tracking and acquisition application is presented in detail to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the proposed design. Complete design details of the platform are also presented. The designed module implements the basic proportional-integral-derivative control and a custom target acquisition algorithm. Details of the sliding-window-based algorithm are also presented. This algorithm performs $20\times $ faster than comparable approaches in OpenCV with equal accuracy. Additional modules can be integrated for more complex applications, such as search-and-rescue, automatic object tracking, and traffic congestion analysis. A hardware architecture for the newly introduced Better Portable Graphics (BPG) compression algorithm is also introduced in the framework of the extensible quadrotor architecture. Since its introduction in 1987, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) graphics format has been the de facto choice for image compression. However, the new compression technique BPG outperforms the JPEG in terms of compression quality and size of the compressed file. The objective is to present a hardware architecture for enhanced real-time compression of the image. Finally, a prototyping platform of a hardware architecture for a secure digital camera (SDC) integrated with the secure BPG (SBPG) compression algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture is suitable for high-performance imaging in the IoT and is prototyped in Simulink.

Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},   keywords={cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;signal detection;smart cities;speech processing;running speech;sustained vowel;energy distribution;linear prediction analysis;source signal;automatic voice disorder detection system;healthcare resources;elderly people;smart healthcare systems;smart technologies;cloud computing;Internet of Things;smart cities;voice complications;automatic health monitoring system;frequency 1 Hz to 1562 Hz;Speech;Smart cities;Monitoring;Medical services;Senior citizens;Feature extraction;Acoustics;Smart cities;health monitoring;voice disorders;liner prediction;GMM},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2680467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={246-251},   abstract={Rapid technological advancement in wireless sensor networks has contributed for the great increase in number of IP-connected smaller smart sensors that, in turn, become part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient utilization of the IoT for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication requires security. The IETF 6L0WPAN standard provides the mechanism for IPv6 packet transmission over low-power wireless personal area networks. Thus, the interconnection of wireless sensor devices to the Internet facilitates the M2M communication with many application areas such as smart grid, metering, health, environment, vehicle and home appliances. M2M communication over the 6L0WPAN has security challenges as a result of the greater number of 61owpan devices, smaller packet transmission, low power, low processing and various application areas. In order to secure the subsequent M2M communication over the 6L0WPAN, secure authentication and session key exchange schemes among the communicating parties are needed. Therefore, in this paper we propose SAKES - a secure authentication and key establishment scheme - for the M2M communication in the 6L0WPAN. The security analysis is done for different attack scenarios. The impact of DoS attack in the performance of the 6L0WPAN is evaluated. The evaluation is carried out by using OPNET simulation tool. Our simulation result showed the severity of DoS attack and the necessity of the proposed security scheme so as to maintain the constrained resources.},   keywords={intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;IP networks;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;SAKES;secure authentication and key establishment;M2M communication;IP-based wireless sensor network;IP-connected smaller smart sensors;internet of things;IoT;machine-to-machine communication;IETF 6LoWPAN standard;security;IPv6 packet transmission;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor devices Internet;smart grid;metering;home appliances;packet transmission;secure authentication;session key exchange schemes;security analysis;attack scenarios;DoS attack;OPNET simulation tool;authentication;key establishment;6L0WPAN security;Internet of Things (IoT);M2M communication},   doi={10.1109/ICUFN.2013.6614820},   ISSN={2165-8528},   month={July},}

 title={End-to-end service assurance in IoT MQTT-SN}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={290-296},   abstract={MQTT-SN offers energy efficient data transportation under unreliable wireless environment with limited energy/ bandwidth. However, MQTT-SN faces a new set of challenges for service guarantees when operated for a reliable or time-critical applications. The impact of various network parameters on the MQTT-SN service assurance requires an end-to-end system study, which are unexplored yet. In this paper we analyze in detail about the end-to-end service assurance parameters such as content delivery delay and probability of content delivery for a MQTT-SN to be used in health care Internet of Things (IoT). To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals. Both these service assurance parameters will give more insight into the number of content/request arrivals that can be supported for a given service assurance requirement. In addition these service assurance parameters will be of help to design the system more effectively. We carry out a detailed ns2 based simulation to show impacts of various system parameters on the network performances for various QoS services designed for MQTT-SN system.},   keywords={computer network reliability;delay estimation;energy conservation;Internet of Things;probability;quality of service;queueing theory;radiotelemetry;telecommunication scheduling;transport protocols;wireless sensor networks;NS2 based simulation;QoS service;content delivery delay estimation;end-to-end content delivery probability;TOPIC ID based matching station;round-robin queue scheduler;UDP;TCP;health care Internet of Things;message queue telemetry transport;wireless environment;energy efficient data transportation;loT MQTT-SN;end-to-end service assurance;Logic gates;Quality of service;Delays;Medical services;Round robin;Subscriptions;Transportation},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2015.7157991},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},   keywords={compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;long-term health monitoring;signal characteristics;personalized features;physiologic signals;cotraining approach;sensing matrix;isometry property;signal sparsity;ECG signals;compression ratio;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;Sensors;Dictionaries;Sparse matrices;Physiology;Training;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless communication;Data-driven compressive sensing;mobile healthcare;wearable sensing;Internet of things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278},   ISSN={2379-190X},   month={March},}

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.},   keywords={data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);wearable computers;on-node sensor data analytics;deep learning approach;wearable devices;inertial sensor;spectral domain preprocessing;smartphones;Internet-of-Things;Human Activity Recognition;HAR;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis;Spectrogram;Real-time systems;Pipelines;Performance evaluation;ActiveMiles;deep learning;Human Activity Recognition (HAR);Internet-of-Things (IoT);low-power devices;wearable;Human Activities;Humans;Machine Learning;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Neural Networks (Computer);Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2016.2633287},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Jan},}

Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers.

In this paper, we describe both new technologies and advancements to heterogeneous integration technology tools, materials and processes that provide differentiating electronics for future healthcare diagnostic tools and sensors. These new technologies are being applied to targeted applications in healthcare diagnostics and sensor monitoring for precision diagnostic data, smaller product size and much lower costs. Data streams can leverage AI to provide smart personalized healthcare guidance or solutions that compliment existing technology and data to partners such as healthcare professionals, patients and clients. In many applications, we leverage industry available technology or benefit from these new technology advancements to provide for the best system solution. Examples of these new and advancing technologies include: (1) Precision handling thinned wafers with large die, small die, multi-die, sub-components, components and substrates technologies, (2) Injection molded solder (IMS) technology for wafers (TSV and / or interconnection) and substrates, (3) Precision micro-component, die, multi-die substrate and multi-component assembly / integration technology for healthcare, IoT and AI Systems, (4) Precision laser micro-machining, cutting and welding technology, (5) Flexible multi-channel, micro-fluidic systems for smart sensing, point of care (POC) diagnostics, and AI and (6) Small form factor micro-systems and energy solutions / technologies that support future healthcare, IoT, and AI linked computing solutions.

 title={Personalized wearable systems for real-time ECG classification and healthcare interoperability: Real-time ECG classification and FHIR interoperability}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={9-14},   abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},   keywords={adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising;ECG classification;wearable health monitoring devices;personalized health-care monitoring devices;signal processing;Savitzky-Golay filter;machine learning models;MIT-BIH Physionet;ECG kits biopotential measurements;kNN classifiers;neural net fitting models;SNOMED coding system;feature extraction method;ECG event observations;MITDB arrhythmia database;recursive least square adaptive filter;3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG waveforms;arrhythmia classification;heart rate variability analysis;electronic health records database;ECG monitoring;wearable biomedical devices;FHIR interoperability;healthcare interoperability;personalized wearable systems;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Adaptive filters;Real-time systems;Arrhythmia classification;Wearable IoT;Healthcare monitoring;ECG signal processing;Arrhythmia detection;Arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;ECG FHIR;SNOMED-CT FHIR;HAPI FHIR},   doi={10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

It involves a large quantity of smart devices for sensing health parameters including temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure and patient mobility. The medial sensing devices are connected with a somehow more powerful device like cell phone to exchange health parameters based data to central repositories at cloud. During data aggregation process, the collector nodes receive duplicate values that should be eliminated to reduce communication overheads. Due to sensitive nature of data, it must provide the secure data exchange to guard against various security attacks. To resolve these issues, we have presented a Secure De-duplicated Data Dissemination (S-DDD) scheme for healthcare IoT scenario using FoG servers at the edge of the network. To remove redundancy, we have also proposed a lightweight de-duplication mechanism that includes adaptive chunking algorithm (ACA) for identifying the cut-point between two windows. Moreover, we propose a symmetric key based encryption mechanism for healthcare data exchange from smart devices towards a collector node. We have simulated our work using NS-2.35.

Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={678-683},   abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the healthcare by providing high-quality services, lowering the costs, and increasing the efficiency of management by allowing the physical objects to integrate with computer systems to collect the sensed data and process as per the need. Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario. Finally, the paper concludes with the reported results.},   keywords={body area networks;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;resource allocation;virtual machines;wireless sensor networks;sensed data;healthcare industries;automated services;disease diagnosis/analysis;Wireless Body Area Network;WBAN;sensor nodes;healthcare data;life-critical pervasive healthcare applications;data rates;default resource allocation strategy;response time;simulated IoT healthcare workloads;IoT scenario;cloud environment;internet-of-Things;high-quality services;physical objects;computer systems;Cloud computing;Medical services;Resource management;Time factors;Heart rate;Wireless communication;Temperature measurement;Cloud Computing;IoT;Wireless Body Area Network;Virtual Resource Allocation;Healthcare;Internet-of-Things;Wireless Sensor Networks;Response Time;Uneven Workloads},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.65},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

With the rapid development of computer and sensors, various bits of data are continuously being generated as time goes by. The amount of data to be processed has entered into the big data category. Data mining is widely used to discover hidden information in the large amounts of data. However, data mining applied to medical databases is a challenging process. The unavailability of large raw data and data complexity are some of the difficulties encountered. This research work proposes a way of dealing with big medical data with a case study of gout disease. Gout is common chronic disease caused by the most important risk factor hyperuricemia. There is no drug to completely cure the gout, the patient is suffering a lot of pain. It is important to control the occurrence of gout and to study the association of gout with other metabolic diseases. This paper discusses methods for the analysis of this complex dataset of this disease, to help get more understanding of the disease and associated diseases. Association Rule is used as the mining algorithm for the data processing. An associated relation is proposed according to the experiments, which applies auxiliary support for doctor's clinical diagnosis and disease research in the local.},   keywords={Big Data;data mining;diseases;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;data mining;data complexity;gout disease;medical big data processing;hyperuricemia;metabolic diseases;association rule;Data mining;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging;Itemsets;medical big data;data mining;association rule;association model},   doi={10.1109/ICCCBDA.2018.8386511},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Based on RGB colour theory, the system was implemented using a myRio board, which interacts with a mobile application. Bio-samples (urine) gathered from volunteers were tested using this board and with a hand-held refractometer. The results showed that it is possible to infer the BHL by analysing the blue values of RGB colour and by comparison with the recommended urine colour chart.

 title={Boosting the Battery Life of Wearables for Health Monitoring Through the Compression of Biosignals}, 
  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={5},   pages={1647-1662},   abstract={Modern wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices enable the monitoring of vital parameters such as heart or respiratory (RESP) rates, electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals within e-health applications. A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude. Finally, avenues for future research are discussed.},   keywords={body sensor networks;data compression;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable computers;health monitoring;vital parameters;ECG;photoplethysmographic signals;e-health applications;signal transmission;lossy signal compression;biosignal compression algorithms;wearable Internet of Things devices;Biomedical signal processing;energy efficiency;pattern recognition;signal compression;sparse autoencoders;wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689164},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={xx-xxi},   abstract={In recent years, the growing demand of personal healthcare has attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure. Using the model, diseases are ranked according to the current symptoms and stored in the server. Information of diseases and appropriate treatment therapies is sent back to the patient as well as stored in a web portal for personal monitoring.},   keywords={bioinformatics;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;patient treatment;pattern clustering;temperature measurement;temperature sensors;health informatics;intelligent system;personal healthcare monitoring;Internet-of-Thing technology;IoT technology;knowledge model;physical conditions;IoT device;LM35 sensors;temperature measurement;pulse sensor;heart beat;ESP8266 sensors;network connection;disease diagnosis;viral fever;hypothermia;tachycardia;heart failure;intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system;intuitionistic fuzzy set;multicriteria IFRS;single-criterion IFRS;intuitionistic fuzzy vector;intuitionistic vector similarity measure;IVSM},   doi={10.1109/NICS.2016.7725627},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

As a result, traffic congestion occurs, especially in large urban areas. Therefore, in order to avoid traffic jams, immediate solutions have to be found. Various technologies have been used to design and develop such solutions in the past. While some developers have used classic technologies, others have integrated various emerging technologies in the systems they built in order to make roadways safer. Acting both inside the vehicle and along the roadways the new designed systems are able to inform drivers about traffic conditions and possible hazards. This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based approach to solve some of the problems that traffic congestion raises. Furthermore, this approach provides the means to monitor a set of environmental parameters, including air quality, and to raise early warnings and alarms when critical levels are reached.

However, coexisting technologies operating in unlicensed bands need to share limited spectrum resources while attempting to offer desired performance. This could prove challenging as channel access is not guaranteed, which raises concerns for wireless coexistence in sensitive applications like medical devices. In this article, we provide a brief review of topics forming the current stage of wireless coexistence in research, industry, and regulatory circles.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming more and more pervasive in everyday life and connecting an array of diverse physical objects. It is fast growing and receiving a tremendous amount of research focus. Billions of objects communicate each other with or without human intervention to achieve smart applications. Most of the connected devices are constrained nodes to its ecosystem which have limited memories, CPU capabilities and power sources. Therefore, for implementing autonomous smart systems, efficient energy consumption is imperative. This paper introduces a novel scheduling algorithm called Long Hop (LH) first to optimize energy usage on a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that enables IoT system. LH algorithm schedules high priority for packets coming with more hops and longer distances to be served first at the cluster head (CH) nodes of the WSN. Since these packets require more links and nodes (thus increased energy and bandwidth usage) to reach the ultimate destination if not prioritized, the proposed algorithm reduces the overall energy usage and minimizes the total number of packets re-transmission and the effective data transmission distances. This improves the overall system performance and elongates the network lifetime.},   keywords={computer network reliability;energy conservation;energy consumption;Internet of Things;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks;LH first scheduling algorithm;scalable Internet of Things networks;diverse physical object array;constrained nodes;power sources;CPU capabilities;cluster head nodes;packet re-transmission;data transmission distances;network lifetime;IoT system;WSN;Wireless Sensor Network;energy usage;efficient energy consumption;autonomous smart systems;connected devices;smart applications;energy efficient long hop first scheduling algorithm;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Scheduling algorithms;Energy consumption;Clustering algorithms;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);Energy Efficient;Scheduling algorithms;Long Hop First (LH) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)},   doi={10.1109/ICSensT.2017.8304511},   ISSN={2156-8073},   month={Dec},}

To prevent such risks, statistics related to hypertension have to be monitored and analyzed in real time. Internet of Things (IoT) assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to monitor blood pressure and to diagnose the stage of hypertension in real time. In this paper, IoT-Fog based healthcare system is proposed for continuous monitoring and analysis of blood pressure statistics to predict hypertensive users. The proposed system initially identifies the stage of hypertension on the basis of user’s health parameters collected using IoT sensors at fog layer. After identifying the hypertensive stage, artificial neural network is used for predicting the risk level of hypertension attack in users at remote sites. The vital point of this paper is to continuously generate emergency alerts of blood pressure fluctuation from fog system to hypertensive users on their mobile phones. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user are stored on cloud storage for sharing with domain experts such as clinicians, doctors and personal caregivers. The temporal information generated from fog layer can be utilized for providing precautionary measures and suggestions well on time for patients’ wellness.

While some exposure to radiation is acceptable, radiation monitoring should be done to keep the levels of radiation exposure to a minimum. In this paper, we intend to monitor and measure the radiation levels that a specific area is exposed to using a radiation sensor, and to send the data to a cloud from where the values can be accessed by the concerned authorities. In order to meet the objectives we utilize GM counters, which are radiation sensors that detect and measure the amount of radiation present in the radiation environment. The GM counter is interfaced to a NodeMCU to update the detected and measured radiation to a radiation IoT platform that can store and retrieve data across a network. Further, a GPS module is interfaced with the NodeMCU to locate the location data of the radiation emitted from the radiation sources under such radiation environment. The radiation values are remotely monitored in real time through web server configured with the radiation IoT platform to remote monitor the radiation level and mapping the location of such radiations.},   keywords={computerised monitoring;data acquisition;Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;local area networks;radiation monitoring;onizing radiation;geo tagged Internet of Things device;geo tagged IoT device;NodeMCU;GPS module;Web server;radiation values;radiation sources;radiation IoT platform;detected measured radiation;GM counter;radiation sensor;radiation levels;radiation exposure;radiation monitoring;Radiation detectors;Electron tubes;Ionizing radiation;Isotopes;Radiation monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of Things;GM counter;GPS module Radiation Measurements;Remote monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8125878},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;polynomials;positron emission tomography;feature learning;multimodal stacked deep polynomial networks;Alzheimer disease diagnosis;mild cognitive impairment;multimodal neuroimaging data;magnetic resonance imaging;positron emission tomography;AD diagnosis;deep polynomial networks;deep learning algorithm;multimodal stacked DPN algorithm;MM-SDPN algorithm;feature representation;to fed high-level features;MRI;PET;ADNI dataset;binary classification;multiclass classification;state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithm;Neuroimaging;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Prediction algorithms;Diseases;Positron emission tomography;Alzheimer's disease;deep learning;deep polynomial networks;multimodal stacked deep polynomial networks;multimodal neuroimaging},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2017.2655720},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={2},   pages={794-801},   abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multiorgan failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user's infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user's mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using temporal network analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision trees;diseases;graph theory;health care;mobile computing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;healthcare framework;Aedes agypti;healthcare services;fog-cloud technology;fog assisted healthcare system;decision tree;real-time healthcare data;Chikungunya virus infection;Chikungunya virus outbreak;fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system;Cloud computing;Sensors;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Pain;Decision trees;Chikungunya;cloud computing (CC);decision tree;fog computing (FOC);temporal network analysis (TNA)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Over the past 50 years, public health in Latin America has walked through significant changes on social and economic aspects. Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Latin America;geographical coverage;physical health stands;Latin American healthcare systems;Latin American governments;wearable technology adoption;healthcare wearable technology challenges;Internet of Medical Things;IoMT;healthcare wearable technology;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Government;Security;Public healthcare;Real-time systems;healthcare;wearable;IoMT;Latin-America;adoption;barriers;challenges},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399181},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

As use of these devices becomes more widespread, the need to protect them becomes more important. In this research, the RF-DNA fingerprinting method is examined to protect these devices using their physical layer attributes. In particular, the traditional method of using parametric features such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis is challenged with the use of non-parametric features mean, median, mode and linear regression coefficient estimates.

Minimising the destruction of failing critical infrastructure components or system components that are geographically close critical services is essential. Equally important are the system of systems relationships that a failing system has, as these could render a minor system critical under certain circumstances. Infrastructure failure is usually brought under control through system adaptation e.g. using sensor area networks to close valves or by emergency response e.g. extinguishing fires. Current response procedures rely on antiquated information sharing techniques and provide little or no opportunity to effect change within the failing infrastructures systems. There may also be minimal understanding of the important systems of systems role that is being provided by components of the failing system.

To understand and design such systems, engineers must be facilitated with the appropriate modeling tools.

Requirements comprise a basic concept of a systematic model-driven methodology that enables the successful management of the criticalities in system design, implementation and deployment.

There is also the emergence of smart environments such as smart homes, cars, highways, cities, factories and grids. Presently, it is difficult to quickly forecast or prevent urgent health situations in real-time as health data are analyzed offline by a physician. Sensors are expected to be overloaded by demands of providing health data from IoT networks and smart environments. This paper proposes to resolve the problems by introducing an inference system so that life-threatening situations can be prevented in advance based on a short and long term health status prediction. This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud. The inference system can also resolve the problem of data overload in sensor nodes by reducing data volume and frequency to reduce workload in sensor nodes.

Because the medical records in IoT-based hospital information system (HIS) are dispersedly obtained from distributed devices such as tablet computer, personal digital assistant, automated analyzer, and other medical devices, they are raw, simple, weak-content, and massive. Such medical records cannot be used for further analyzing and decision supporting due to that they are collected in a weak-semantic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enrich IoT-based medical records by linking them with the knowledge in linked open data. A case study is conducted on a real-world IoT-based HIS system in association with our approach, the experimental results show that medical records in the local HIS system are significantly enriched and useful for healthcare analysis and decision making, and further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach for knowledge accessing.},   keywords={decision making;electronic health records;health care;Internet of Things;notebook computers;patient treatment;medical treatment;IoT-based facilities;raw medical records;medical advice;hospital information system;medical devices;medical record enrichment;distributed devices;linked open data;IoT-based HIS system;local HIS system;healthcare analysis;decision making;knowledge accessing;Medical diagnostic imaging;Resource description framework;Tools;Hospitals;Knowledge based systems;Data models;Internet of Thing;health care;knowledge graph;linked open data;semantic technology;data engineering;data sciences},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2810837},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Leveraging the Potential of WSN for an Efficient Correction of Air Pollution Fine-Grained Simulations}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={One of the main concerns of smart cities is to improve public health which is mainly threatened by air pollution due to the massively increasing urbanization. The reduction of air pollution starts first with an efficient monitoring of air quality where the main aim is to generate accurate pollution maps in real time. Spatiotemporally fine-grained air pollution maps can be obtained using physical models which simulate the phenomenon of pollution dispersion. However, these simulations are less accurate than measurements that can be obtained using pollution sensors. Combining simulations and measurements, also known as data assimilation, provides better pollution estimations through the correction of the fine-grained simulations of physical models. The quality of data assimilation mainly depends on the number of measurements and their locations. A careful deployment of nodes is therefore necessary in order to get better pollution maps. In this paper, we tackle the deployment problem of pollution sensors and propose a new mixed integer programming model allowing to minimize the overall deployment cost of the network while achieving a required assimilation quality and ensuring the connectivity of the network. We then design a heuristic algorithm to solve efficiently the problem in polynomial time. We perform extensive simulations on a dataset of the Lyon city, France and show that our approach provides better air quality monitoring when compared to existing deployment methods that are designed without taking into account the outputs of physical models. We also show that in terms of connectivity, the communication range of sensor nodes might have a noteworthy impact on the quality of pollution estimation.},   keywords={Air pollution;Atmospheric modeling;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Sensor phenomena and characterization},   doi={10.1109/ICCCN.2018.8487343},   ISSN={1095-2055},   month={July},}

With limited computational power, BSN devices are often not able to provide strong security mechanisms to protect sensitive personal and health information, such as one's physiological data. Consequently, many new methods of securing Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been proposed recently. One effective solution is the Biometric Cryptosystem (BCS) approach. BCS exploits physiological and behavioral biometric traits, including face, iris, fingerprints, Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Photoplethysmography (PPG). In this paper, we propose a new BCS approach for securing wireless communications for wearable and implantable healthcare devices using gait signal energy variations and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework. By simultaneously extracting similar features from BSN sensors using our approach, binary keys can be generated on demand without user intervention. Through an extensive analysis on our BCS approach using a gait dataset, the results have shown that the binary keys generated using our approach have high entropy for all subjects. The keys can pass both NIST and Dieharder statistical tests with high efficiency. The experimental results also show the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of the similarity of intra-class keys and the discriminability of the inter-class keys.},   keywords={Sensors;Security;Wireless communication;Biometrics (access control);Wireless sensor networks;Servers;Communication system security;wearable security;gait biometrics;artificial neural network;data privacy;wireless communications;IoT security},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2018.2860780},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={},}

In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={405-414},   abstract={Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The diagnosis of OSA requires an overnight sleep experiment in a laboratory. However, due to limitations in relation to the number of labs and beds available, patients often need to wait a long time before being diagnosed and eventually treated. In addition, the unfamiliar environment and restricted mobility when a patient is being tested with a polysomnogram may disturb their sleep, resulting in an incomplete or corrupted test. Therefore, it is posed that a PSG conducted in the patient's home would be more reliable and convenient. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the e-Health system. In this paper, we implement an IoT-based wireless polysomnography system for sleep monitoring, which utilizes a batterypowered, miniature, wireless, portable, and multipurpose recorder. A Java-based PSG recording program in the personal computer is designed to save several bio-signals and transfer them into the European data format. These PSG records can be used to determine a patient's sleep stages and diagnose OSA. This system is portable, lightweight, and has low power-consumption. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed PSG system, a comparison was made between the standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system. Several healthy volunteer patients participated in the PSG experiment and were monitored by both the standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system simultaneously, under the supervision of specialists at the Sleep Laboratory in Taipei Veteran General Hospital. A comparison of the results of the time-domain waveform and sleep stage of the two systems shows that the proposed system is reliable and can be applied in practice. The proposed system can facilitate the long-term tracing and research of personal sleep monitoring at home.},   keywords={biomechanics;biomedical measurement;electroencephalography;electro-oculography;Internet of Things;Java;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;sleep;PSG system;standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System;healthy volunteer patients;PSG experiment;Sleep Laboratory;sleep stage;personal sleep monitoring;IoT;wireless polysomnography intelligent system;obstructive sleep apnea;overnight sleep experiment;patient;e-Health system;wireless polysomnography system;PSG recording program;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Standards;Wireless communication;Software;Polysomnography (PSG);JAVA;Internet of Things;wireless;sleep monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2765702},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This presentation discusses some methods used for anomaly detection and prognostics, including the monitoring and reasoning of parameters that are precursors to impending “failure”, such as shifts in performance parameters; and the modeling of stress and damage utilizing life cycle loads (e.g., usage, temperature, vibration, radiation).

 title={Towards a Physiologically-Aware Architecture for Transmission of Biomedical Signals in BASNs/IoT}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The continued growth and popularity of IoT-based wearables coupled with wireless body area sensor network (BASN) communication architectures continues to gain widespread adoption for e-Health applications. Challenges facing the adoption of this vision require e- Health communication architectures for wearable IoT/BASNs to make effective use of bandwidth, energy stores for extended continuous transmission of physiological data, mitigation of computational burden when analyzing the data in the cloud at a global scale and, most importantly, ensuring the features of clinical significance in the biomedical signal are not compromised. In this paper, we present a novel physiologically-aware communication architecture to address these challenges for wearable IoT/BASNs for e-Health applications. The architecture works by extracting patient health state using local in-node pre-diagnosis (or pre-screening) to help guide the operation of the communication architecture in deciding when data should be transmitted, its type and format, and given quality. This latter property on preserving signal 'quality' is central to the architecture, which employs a feature-based diagnostic distortion measure to ensure retention of features of clinical significance during source coding in order to guarantee their reconstruction; a notion which carries greater emphasis for biomedical signals as opposed to ordinary multimedia signals. Simulation work of the architecture is presented in MATLAB using Electrocardiograph (ECG) signals from PhysioNet's ECG database, where it is demonstrated energy savings are realized by a factor of 30 with a reduction in biomedical data volume as high as 86% for tested cases while preserving clinical features.},   keywords={body area networks;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;physiologically-aware architecture;biomedical signal;BASNs/IoT;IoTbased wearables;wireless body area sensor network communication architectures;BASN;e-Health applications;wearable IoT/BASNs;physiological data;clinical significance;patient health state;in-node pre-diagnosis;feature-based diagnostic distortion measure;biomedical data volume;clinical features;signal quality;multimedia signals;electrocardiograph signals;health communication architectures;physiologically-aware communication architecture;Distortion measurement;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Distortion;Biomedical monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422796},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

WSNs consist of sensors with wireless capability operating autonomously and reporting application specific parameters to a central entity. Many applications including industrial applications require the WSN to have a low and deterministic delay. Having a deterministic network delay in a WSN is challenging in the best case when traditional Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are employed. To enable low power, high reliability and deterministic WSNs, IETF recently proposed 6TiSCH protocol which uses time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) MAC with IPv6 addressing. This protocol dynamically assigns bandwidth resources to the nodes in the network according to the application requirements. This paper describes an implementation of 6TiSCH protocol in Contiki OS and a distributed scheduling mechanism for this protocol. We evaluate the protocol performance using Cooja simulator for different networking scenarios and compare it to that of a slotted Aloha type access mechanism.},   keywords={access protocols;bandwidth allocation;Internet of Things;IP networks;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks;WSN;deterministic network delay;medium access control protocols;MAC protocols;IETF;6TiSCH protocol;time slotted channel hopping MAC;TSCH MAC;IPv6 addressing;Contiki OS;distributed scheduling mechanism;Cooja simulator;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Media Access Protocol;Dogs;Machine-to-machine communications;Delays;IoT;M2M;6Tisch;Wireless Sensor Networks},   doi={10.1109/SIU.2017.7960606},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

IoT has the power to transform cities into Smart Cities. As a consequence, we have been witnessing the proliferation of IoT deployments in Smart Cities that aim to improve processes in various domains such as, energy, transport, health, mobility, etc. Environmental noise is one of the major issues affecting the health and well-being of residents in an urban environment. A major contribution in noise pollution comes from road traffic. This work presents an innovative IoT-based approach to monitor and manage road traffic noise in Smart Cities. Our approach uses an IoT platform for collecting and integrating data streams stemming from multifarious sensing devices. The data are then analyzed in order to identify traffic noise events; if the noise level on a particular road exceeds a specified threshold, the traffic flow is controlled by taking certain measures.

Specifically, when a person's footstep-generated floor vibrations can be detected and located then it is possible to locate persons moving within a building. This emergent cyber-physical system holds the potential for an ambient localization service. This service would enable indoor localization without needing the building occupants to carry a device that enables localization as required by some wireless localization technologies. Vibration propagation in buildings has complexities not encountered by acoustic or radio wave propagation in air. Thus, conventional localization algorithms do not address the technical challenges of this application. This paper identifies different aspects of propagation relevant to the task of footstep localization and adapts techniques from seismology and signal processing to formulate a localization strategy. Experiments conducted in an instrumented, public building validate the proposed approach.

While research and development continue for general IoT devices, there are many application domains where very tiny, concealable, and non-intrusive Things are needed. The properties of recently studied nanomaterials, such as graphene, have inspired the concept of Internet of NanoThings (IoNT), based on the interconnection of nanoscale devices. Despite being an enabler for many applications, the artificial nature of IoNT devices can be detrimental where the deployment of NanoThings could result in unwanted effects on health or pollution. The novel paradigm of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is introduced in this paper by stemming from synthetic biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of biological embedded computing devices. Based on biological cells, and their functionalities in the biochemical domain, Bio-NanoThings promise to enable applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation networks, and environmental control of toxic agents and pollution.

  year={2017},   volume={11},   number={3},   pages={1888-1896},   abstract={Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},   keywords={channel capacity;electromagnetic interference;game theory;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;Internet of vehicles;e-health applications;electromagnetic interference;EMI;power control algorithm;noncooperative game theoretic framework;channel capacity;best-response-dynamics algorithm;network-level optimal capacity;mobile hospital;Games;Electromagnetic interference;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Hospitals;Mobile handsets;E-health;game theory;mobile hospital;Nash equilibrium;power control},   doi={10.1109/JSYST.2015.2441720},   ISSN={1932-8184},   month={Sept},}

 title={Internet-of-Things and Smart Homes for Elderly Healthcare: An End User Perspective}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={10483-10496},   abstract={Although an Internet-of-Things-based smart home solution can provide an improved and better approach to healthcare management, yet its end user adoption is very low. With elderly people as the main target, these conservative users pose a serious challenge to the successful implementation of smart home healthcare services. The objective of this research was to develop and test a theoretical framework empirically for determining the core factors that can affect the elderly users' acceptance of smart home services for healthcare. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people aged 55 years and above across four Asian countries. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the effect of eight hypothesized predicting constructs. The user perceptions were measured on a conceptual level rather than the actual usage intention toward a specific service. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, expert advice, and perceived trust have a positive impact on the behavioral intention. The same association is negative for technology anxiety and perceived cost. Facilitating conditions and social influence do not have any effect on the behavioral intention. The model could explain 81.4% of the total variance in the dependent variable i.e., behavioral intention. Effort expectancy is the leading predictor of smart homes for healthcare acceptance among the elderly. Together with expert advice, perceived trust, and perceived cost, these four factors represent the key influence of the elderly peoples' acceptance behavior. This paper provides the groundwork to explore the process of the actual adoption of smart home services for healthcare by the elderly people with potential future research areas.},   keywords={geriatrics;health care;home automation;human factors;Internet of Things;medical information systems;behavioral intention;effort expectancy;smart homes;healthcare acceptance;expert advice;perceived trust;perceived cost;end user perspective;Internet-of-Things;smart home solution;healthcare management;end user adoption;conservative users;smart home healthcare services;user perceptions;Senior citizens;Smart homes;Medical services;Wearable sensors;Bibliographies;Sensor systems;Elderly;healthcare;smart homes},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2808472},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This study introduces a model where patients authorize representatives, who will be authenticated by hospitals, to transfer information to other hospitals safely for security, practicality, and efficiency. Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository.

  year={2018},   volume={12},   number={4},   pages={762-773},   abstract={Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is one of the main under-diagnosed sleep disorder. It is an aggravating factor for several serious cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. There is, however, a lack of medical devices for long-term ambulatory monitoring of OSA since current systems are rather bulky, expensive, intrusive, and cannot be used for long-term monitoring in ambulatory settings. In this paper, we propose a wearable, accurate, and energy efficient system for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea on a long-term basis. As an embedded system for Internet of Things, it reduces the gap between home health-care and professional supervision. Our approach is based on monitoring the patient using a single-channel electrocardiogram signal. We develop an efficient time-domain analysis to meet the stringent resources constraints of embedded systems to compute the sleep apnea score. Our system, for a publicly available database (PhysioNet Apnea-ECG), has a classification accuracy of up to 88.2% for our new online and patient-specific analysis, which takes the distinct profile of each patient into account. While accurate, our approach is also energy efficient and can achieve a battery lifetime of 46 days for continuous screening of OSA.},   keywords={body sensor networks;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;embedded systems;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;sleep;time-domain analysis;medical wearable sensors;obstructive sleep apnea;OSA;sleep disorder;serious cardiovascular diseases;medical devices;long-term ambulatory monitoring;current systems;long-term monitoring;ambulatory settings;wearable energy efficient;long-term basis;embedded system;efficient time-domain analysis;sleep apnea score;PhysioNet Apnea-ECG;new online patient-specific analysis;online obstructive sleep apnea detection;accurate energy efficiency;time 46.0 d;Electrocardiography;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Batteries;Feature extraction;Wearable sensors;Long-term monitoring;Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA);Online detection;Real-time classification;Wearable sensor},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2824659},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={Aug},}

To ensure robust protection for micro-grid, intelligent continuous monitoring and fault classification mechanism is required along with existing traditional protection scheme. Industrial internet of things (IIOT) makes low-cost continuous health monitoring data from EV micro-grid available. Manually processing of these bulk data for fault classification is cost and time consuming, and impractical. Neural network (NN) and other artificial intelligence classification systems require time-consuming feature engineering. In this digest, a Deep Neural Network (NN) framework, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) are applied for automatic and rapid processing of bulk health monitoring data for high precision micro-grid fault classification. The proposed classification method learns from data autonomously and extracts features by identifying anomalies in converter and inverter output voltage, and DC-link capacitor voltage amplitude, phase angle and harmonic components. This CNN based fault classification method shows better performance compared to conventional artificial intelligence based fault classification systems.

With billions of devices deployed, traditional manual preventive maintenance approaches will be cost prohibitive. As we make these small autonomous devices intelligent, it is critical that we also give them a very advanced ability to assess and report their own health. Of course, on-board diagnostics are not a new concept. What is new with the Internet of Things is the extreme economic leverage that the on-board diagnostics will have due to the huge number of devices to be developed. If the on-board diagnostics perform poorly, the resulting surge of support costs could be enough to drive the organization deploying the Internet of Things systems out of business. As an organization gets ready to release millions of a certain type of Internet of Things device into the wild, how confident can the organization be that the on-board diagnostics will really perform as expected?

This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project.

The improving and opening of the health and medical data, as well as the wide use of the environment and the human body sensors, gives us the opportunity to do so. This paper proposes an "observant clinician and touchable patient" integrated architecture (OCTOPIA), which is for both clinician and patient and extendible. On the basis of integrated medical knowledge, human health and environmental data, OCTOPIA interacts with the patient in a heuristic way to analyze the patient's symptoms and likely diseases. Then, comprehensive data information will be presented to the clinician. In all key links, clinicians will have the opportunity to use their own experience to influence the final diagnosis. Broadly, OCTOPIA consists of five major components: data capture, symptom-disease graph, QA system, ranking likely diseases and visualization. This paper proposes an architecture integrating the environment and human body information, and presents the solutions of an interactive QA system for symptom, a multi-factor calculation model for disease and a visualization design. With the help of OCTOPIA, the patient's information and the state of the environment are more fully perceived, while clinician can make a more detailed diagnosis.},   keywords={data visualisation;diseases;graph theory;health care;medical diagnostic computing;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;medical data;human body sensors;observant clinician;touchable patient;OCTOPIA;integrated medical knowledge;human health;environmental data;comprehensive data information;data capture;symptom-disease graph;human body information;observant-clinician;touchable-patient integrated architecture;QA system;visualization design;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Ontologies;Tools;Data mining;Knowledge based systems;Symptom-Disease Graph;Interactive Query;Ambient Intelligence;Diagnosis;Integrated Architecture},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2016.27},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={193-198},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we interact with our environment in domains as diverse as health, transportation, office buildings and our homes. In smart building environments, information captured about the building and its inhabitants will aid in development of services that improve productivity, comfort, social interactions, safety, energy savings and more. However, by collecting and sharing information about building's inhabitants and their activities, these services also open the door to privacy risks. In this paper, we introduce a framework where IoT Assistants capture and manage the privacy preferences of their users and communicate them to privacy-aware smart buildings, which enforce them when collecting user data or sharing it with building services. We outline elements necessary to support such interactions and also discuss important privacy policy attributes that need to be captured. This includes looking at attributes necessary to describe - (1) the data collection and sharing practices associated with deployed sensors and services in smart buildings as well as (2) the privacy preferences to help users manage their privacy in such environments.},   keywords={building management systems;data privacy;Internet of Things;privacy-aware smart buildings;Internet of Things;IoT;privacy preference management;privacy risks;user data collection;privacy policy attributes;data sharing practices;sensors;building services;Smart buildings;Privacy;Intelligent sensors;Data collection;Data privacy;Privacy-aware;Smart Buildings;Privacy Policies;User Preferences;Internet of Things;IoT;Privacy},   doi={10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.52},   ISSN={2332-5666},   month={June},}

Recently there are growing interests in applying machine learning algorithms to activity recognition tasks.

For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques. In the given experiment results, we find that the positioning system achieves a mean positioning accuracy of 1.61 m, which represents a 36.1% improvement over traditional RSS-based fingerprinting.},   keywords={fingerprint identification;indoor radio;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;regression analysis;software radio;Zigbee;anchor nodes;synchronization compensation;multipath propagation;software-defined radio techniques;enhanced pattern matching algorithm;random forest regression model;mean positioning accuracy;RSS fingerprints;feature-based fusion approach;enhanced fingerprinting algorithm;ZigBee signals;narrowband signals;smart cities;smart e-health;smart buildings;IoT networks;control signals;narrow-band signals;cyber systems;received signal strength;indoor positioning system;Bandwidth;Signal processing algorithms;ZigBee;Distance measurement;Pattern matching;Wireless fidelity;Software algorithms;Indoor positioning;Internet of Things;ensemble learning;software defined radio},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794337},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

First, a pilot test was conducted to prove the existence of the problem. The results revealed that 45% of teachers did not know the symptoms of hypoglycemia where 20% of them faced more than 6 cases of diabetic students in a school. Voice of the Customer (VOC) was then gained through a parent survey to identify the Critical to Quality (CTQ). Afterwards, teacher's current performance level was measured by distributing a Knowledge Test and the results revealed that it is 57.7% and therefore, the team decided to focus on increasing and improving health awareness of diabetes for the students and teachers. In order to do that, this research had two folds: developing a mobile application "I. Diabetic" to be used by students to assist them managing their heath condition while they are at school or out having a normal life and applying a six sigma study to increase teacher's awareness regarding diabetes and diabetic students in schools.

ZigBee is a low bit rate protocol utilised in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Attacks such as physical, crypto key interception, injection and replay are perpetrated on ZigBee networks. These attacks can be instigated and controlled within the physical ZigBee WSN location or via a gateway. This paper creates a honeypot that simulates a ZigBee gateway. It is designed to assess the presence of ZigBee attack intelligence on a SSH attack vector. It captures all attack traffic for retrospective analysis. It sandboxes attacks of interest to determine if any attempts are targeting ZigBee specifically.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={With wide development of various information technologies, our daily activities are becoming deeply dependent on cyberspace. People often use handheld devices (e.g., mobile phones or laptops) to publish social messages, facilitate remote e-health diagnosis, or monitor a variety of surveillance. However, security insurance for these activities remains as a significant challenge. Representation of security purposes and their enforcement are two main issues in security of cyberspace. To address these challenging issues, we propose a Cyberspace-oriented Access Control model (CoAC) for cyberspace whose typical usage scenario is as follows. Users leverage devices via network of networks to access sensitive objects with temporal and spatial limitations. We generalize subjects and objects in cyberspace and propose scene-based access control. To enforce security purposes, we argue that all operations on information in cyberspace are combinations of atomic operations. If every single atomic operation is secure, then the cyberspace is secure. Taking applications in the browser-server architecture as an example, we present seven atomic operations for these applications. A number of cases demonstrate that operations in these applications are combinations of introduced atomic operations. We also design a series of security policies for each atomic operation. Finally, we demonstrate both feasibility and flexibility of our CoAC model by examples.},   keywords={Cyberspace;Access control;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Electronic mail;Social network services;Cyberspace-Oriented Access Control;Security Policy;Z Specification.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2839065},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},   keywords={Medical services;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Servers;Prototypes;Senior citizens;Wireless communication;Context-aware data forwarding strategy;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);named data networking of things;NDN;NDNoT.},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723843},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={},}

These physical real-world objects tagged as `Things' in IoT should have a unique identity. These `things' can be remotely controlled and monitored from anywhere in the world through Internet. Due to this feature it has been applied in various domains like home automation, patient health monitoring, agricultural sector, environment surveillance and so on. Due to the increased use of IoT-based system, there arises a need for a well-defined software architecture. Though various IoT developers follow their own design strategies for IoT architecture, there is a need for domain specific architecture for IoT applications. The authors propose a software architecture pattern selection model which can be followed in designing IoT systems. Non-functional requirements such as scalability, availability, reliability, security and heterogeneity determine the decision making of the proposed model. Analytical results prove that this model can be used as a reference model, for IoT developers in choosing a suitable software architecture pattern for their IoT system.},   keywords={Internet of Things;software architecture;software architecture pattern selection model;Internet of Things based systems;smart technology;interactive smart systems;IoT-based system;nonfunctional requirements},   doi={10.1049/iet-sen.2017.0206},   ISSN={1751-8806},   month={},}

M-Sense has been applied in numerous scenarios including mobile-health systems, environmental monitoring, vehicle ad hoc network, mobile social network, and so on. The drawback of existing M-Sense systems in terms of privacy, trust, less efficiency of participating in multiple sensing networks, has motivated the next generation sensing service provisioning approach. This paper introduces a generic service-oriented Mobile Host Sensing as a Service provisioning framework that allows a mobile device to provide sensing data to multiple parties based on mobile Web services.

In this paper, we present a new language dedicated to end users, to describe their activities. We call it ADeL (Activity Description Language). This language is intended to be part of a complete recognition system. Such a system has to be real time, reactive, correct, and dependable. We choose the synchronous approach because it respects these characteristics, it ensures determinism and safe parallel composition, and it allows verification of systems using model-checking.

Currently, we have observed that a plethora of interconnected smartphones, devices, and sensors are deployed for providing personalized services (e.g., social media, smart home, health monitoring) at any time from anywhere. The personalized services offered by IoT, although enhancing the quality of our lives, have serious challenges of securing networks and data in transit, as every day a myriad of devices and services are connected to the IoT. However, existing security solutions, such as two-factor authentication based on passwords along with second-level protection may not be efficient and reliable for providing end-to-end secure communication solutions among different devices and services connected to the IoT. To this end, this article proposes an end-to-end secure IoT-based solution using biometrics and pairing-based cryptography. Because of the uniqueness of one's biometric traits (e.g., face, fingerprint, palm, iris, voice, heartbeat), a biometric-based security solution is less vulnerable to security breaches for IoT systems or infrastructure. We present a biometric- based IoT infrastructure comprising four layers, and for each layer, we discuss possible security challenges along with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we provide a case study of face-based biometric recognition, where sensors or smartphones capture a face image and securely transmit it to the IoT platform to provide end-to end security.},   keywords={cryptography;face recognition;Internet of Things;end-to-end biometrics-based security;pervasive communication;smartphones;sensors;network security;end-to-end secure communication solutions;end-to-end secure IoT-based solution;pairing-based cryptography;biometric traits;biometric-based IoT infrastructure;face-based biometric recognition;face image;Internet of things;Wireless communication;Computer security;Social network services;Smart devices;Authentication;Smart phones;Security},   doi={10.1109/MWC.2016.7721741},   ISSN={1536-1284},   month={October},}

Condition monitoring systems have been widely applied to many industries to acquire operation and equipment related data, through which machine health state can be evaluated. One of the challenges of predicting future machine health lies in extracting the right features that are correlated well with the fault progression/degradation. We propose an enhanced restricted Boltzmann machine with a novel regularization term to automatically generate features that are suitable for remaining useful life prediction. The regularization term tries to maximize the trendability of the output features, which potentially better represent the degradation pattern of a system. The proposed method is benchmarked with regular restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm and principal component analysis. The generated features are used as input to a similarity-based method for life prediction.

Smart Cities leverage the deployment of a network of devices - sensors and mobile devices-, all connected through different means and/or technologies, according to their network availability and capacities, setting a novel framework feeding end-users with an innovative set of smart services. Aligned to this objective, a typical Smart City architecture is organized into layers, including a sensing layer (generates data), a network layer (moves the data), a middleware layer (manages all collected data and makes it ready for usage) and an application layer (provides the smart services benefiting from this data). In this paper a real Smart City is analyzed, corresponding to the city of Barcelona, with special emphasis on the layers responsible for collecting the data generated by the deployed sensors. The amount of daily sensors data transmitted through the network has been estimated and a rough projection has been made assuming an exhaustive deployment that fully covers all city.

 title={Practical Collaborative Learning for Crowdsensing in the Internet of Things with Differential Privacy}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Machine learning is increasingly used to produce predictive models for crowdsensing applications such as health monitoring and query suggestion. These models are more accurate when trained on large amount of data collected from different sources. However, such massive data collection presents serious privacy concerns. The personal crowdsensing data such as photos, voice records, and locations is often highly sensitive, and once being sent out to the collecting companies, falls out of the control of the crowdsensing users who own it. This may preclude the practice of transmitting all user data to a central location and training there using conventional machine learning approaches. In this paper, we advocate an alternative approach that leaves data stored on the user side and learns a shared model by coordinating local training of crowdsensing users in an iterative process. Specifically, we focus on regularized empirical risk minimization and propose an efficient scheme based on decomposition that enables multiple crowdsensing users to jointly learn an accurate learning model for a given learning objective without sharing their private crowdsensing data. We exploit the fact that the optimization problems used in many learning tasks are decomposable and can be solved in a parallel and distributed way by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Considering the heterogeneity of different user devices in practice, we propose an asynchronous ADMM algorithm to speed up the training process.

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={5},   pages={1272-1283},   abstract={Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are electronic devices implanted within human body for diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.},   keywords={authorisation;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;message authentication;prosthetics;authorized medical personnel;IMD security;IMD threat model;IMD access control schemes;implantable medical devices;electronic devices;online authentication;zero power authentication;Access control;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Authentication;US Government agencies;Access control;implantable medical devices (IMDs);survey},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2708042},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

Most of them are capable of sending health statistics to smartphones, smartwatches or smart bands.

Leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT), edge and cloud computing technologies, we propose an architecture which is capable of providing cloud based clinical services using human activity data. Such services could supplement the shortage of staff in primary healthcare centers thereby reducing the burden on healthcare service providers. The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients.

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Servers;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Hospitals;Delays;Cloud computing;privacy;blindness;wireless body area networks (WBANs);Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141},   ISSN={1089-7798},   month={Nov},}

In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate.

Traditional approaches (e.g., polysomnography) are limited to clinic usage. Recent radio frequency-based approaches require specialized devices or dedicated wireless sensors and are only able to track breathing rate. In this paper, we propose to track the vital signs of both breathing rate and heart rate during sleep by using off-the-shelf WiFi without any wearable or dedicated devices. Our system reuses existing WiFi network and exploits the fine-grained channel information to capture the minute movements caused by breathing and heart beats. Our system thus has the potential to be widely deployed and perform continuous long-term monitoring. The developed algorithm makes use of the channel information in both time and frequency domain to estimate breathing and heart rates, and it works well when either individual or two persons are in bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can accurately capture vital signs during sleep under realistic settings, and achieve comparable or even better performance comparing to traditional and existing approaches, which is a strong indication of providing noninvasive, continuous fine-grained vital signs monitoring without any additional cost.},   keywords={biomedical communication;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;sleep;wireless LAN;heart rates;sleep;WiFi signals;human sleeping postures;breathing rate;heart rate;wearable devices;WiFi network;heart beats;vital signs;physical health;WiFi;Monitoring;Wireless fidelity;Heart rate;Sensors;Sleep apnea;Biomedical monitoring;Channel state information (CSI);sleep monitoring;vital signs;WiFi},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2822818},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

 title={Water quality monitoring and waste management using IoT}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Poor water quality in Pettipalam Colony in Thalassery, Kannur District, Kerala is the source of many health issues among the colony residents. Soil and water contamination due to the accumulation of waste is another serious issue that adversely affects the health of the inhabitants in the area. There is a compelling need for the village inhabitants to appropriately monitor the water bodies and take suitable measures to dispose of the waste in the area. Over 2 acres of land is inhabited by people in Pettipalam Colony at Thalassery. Their colony ground was used as a municipal waste dump yard until 2014. Presently, also, the colony residents use the area for waste disposal and open defecation, thus contaminating the land and soil with plastic, organic, and chemical pollutants, etc. These contaminants affect the ground water and get washed into the water bodies when it rains, thus polluting the water resources. Techniques such as Bio-remediation (use of microorganisms to remove or neutralize pollutants) and vermi-composting, which triggers growth of plants that absorb the contaminants, can be introduced to address the issue of reducing the level of contaminants in the soil. But these solutions require proper identification of the contaminants. An extensive sensor system, which can monitor the contaminants in the soil as well as the water bodies, is essential. This project aims to design and develop an IoT based system that can sense the environmental parameters and effectively deliver information on the level of contamination and the quality of the water. Sensors to detect the hydrocarbons, chemical and metal content in the soil can be integrated into a soil probe for monitoring the soil contamination. And sensors for detecting pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc. can be used for monitoring the water quality in the rivers, ponds, etc. in the site of interest. The design, development and implementation of an IoT based system will help the authorities take the necessary steps to perform proper waste management of the affected area. We anticipate that monitoring the suitable parameters will help to impact land restoration initiatives in many areas of India.},   keywords={biotechnology;contaminated site remediation;health and safety;Internet of Things;microorganisms;recycling;sensors;soil pollution;waste disposal;water pollution control;water quality;water resources;sensor system;vermi-composting technique;microorganism use;bioremediation method;Kerala;Kannur District;soil contamination;IoT based system;water resources;ground water;waste disposal;municipal waste dump yard;health issues;Thalassery;Pettipalam Colony;water quality monitoring;Water resources;Water pollution;Monitoring;Soil;Waste management;Real-time systems;Sociology;waste management;IoT;Sensor;Bioremediation;Vermi-composting;water quality},   doi={10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239311},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Due to the heterogeneity of M2M appliances and communication modes, research has been investigating autonomic principles as an efficient instrument for the integration of large populations of dissimilar M2M devices to the M2M gateway and the overall end-to-end M2M architecture. Herein we present the status of semantic support for the IoT field by briefly surveying research efforts in IoT dealing with semantic concerns at the architecture level. We also summarize the state of the art in adaptable protocol stacks and make the case for their application as an efficiency enabler instrument for IoT. To this end, we present our work in an ontology used to semantically describe the adaptation options of the dynamic protocol stacks for future communication devices.

IoT is featured with low-power communications among a massive number of ubiquitously-deployed and energy-constrained electronics, like sensors and actuators. In this context, wireless-powered cooperative relaying emerges as a promising solution to extend coverage and solve energy scarcity problems for IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid relay by combining wireless-powered communications and ambient backscattering functions for improved applicability and performance. To well adapt the hybrid relay to the network environments, we design a mode selection protocol to coordinate between the two functions. Moreover, we analyze the successful transmission probability of a dual-hop relaying system with the hybrid relay. Through numerical results, we demonstrate the performance gain of the hybrid relay and the impact of the system parameters.},   keywords={cooperative communication;energy harvesting;Internet of Things;protocols;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication power management;low-power communications;energy-constrained electronics;wireless-powered cooperative relaying;energy scarcity problems;IoT devices;wireless-powered communications;ambient backscattering functions;network environments;smart objects;wearable health gadgets;household automation devices;personal electronics;dual-hop relaying system;interconnected information network;Internet of Things;ubiquitously-deployed electronics;mode selection protocol;Relays;Backscatter;RF signals;Interference;Protocols;Energy harvesting;Signal to noise ratio},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422300},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The Aldo Paraboni technology demonstration payload, funded by ASI under ESA's ARTES Programme, was embarked as an hosted payload on Alphasat. This Technology Demonstration Payload (identified as TDP5 and recently renamed “Aldo Paraboni”) was implemented under an ESA contract awarded in co-contractorship to Space Engineering and Thales Alenia Space Italia (TAS-I) which conceived the experimental mission and industrialised the subsystems. The Aldo mission is composed of two main elements: a Communication Experiment mission, which aims at assessing the performance of communication links at Q/V Bands; and a Scientific Experiment mission implemented through two beacons at Ka and Q Bands, which aims at characterizing propagation phenomena at these frequencies. During the In Orbit Test campaign of the above two mission components, TDP5 demonstrated compliance to the requirements and the nominal conditions of the Payload. The main topics of this paper are the description of the In Orbit Test requirements and the discussion of tests results. The good health of the Payload is demonstrated by the agreement of the results with the predictions that were calculated on the basis of the results of the on ground test campaign.

Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games.},   keywords={cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;game theory;trusted computing;strategic trust;cloud-enabled cyber-physical systems;glucose control;Internet of Things;IoT;CPS;advanced persistent threats;APT;simultaneous signaling game;FlipIt game;Gestalt Nash equilibrium;GNE;trust mechanism;cloud-assisted insulin pump;Games;Security;Game theory;Cloud computing;Sugar;Stability analysis;Monitoring;Internet of things;cyber-physical systems;trust;cyber-security;signaling game;perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium},   doi={10.1109/TIFS.2017.2725224},   ISSN={1556-6013},   month={Dec},}

This services include teleECG, teleRadiology and teleUSG which utilize mobile technology. In Indonesia, there is a tendency that IoT will be implemented on a large scale. Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to experience deficiency of 500 MHz mobile spectrum in 2020. Therefore, the calculation of spectrum for telemedicine services is urgently needed. This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia.

Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.},   keywords={cloud computing;data acquisition;data integration;emergency services;health care;information retrieval;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;open systems;ubiquitous data accessing method;IoT-based information system;Internet of Things;IoT technology;smart objects;data interoperability methods;information intensive industrial sectors;healthcare services;object diversity;data format heterogeneity problem;information storage;semantic data model;UDA-IoT;IoT data resources accessibility;emergency medical services;IoT data collection;IoT data integration;IoT data interoperability;resource-based IoT data accessing method;distributed heterogeneous data environment;cloud computing platform;mobile computing platform;Data models;Information systems;Hospitals;Distributed databases;Business;Decision support system (DSS);emergencymedical service;Internet of things (IoT);resource model;ubiquitous data accessing},   doi={10.1109/TII.2014.2306382},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={May},}

Recent advances and trends, such as sensor systems, IoT, cloud computing, and data analytics, are making possible to pervasively, efficiently, and effectively collect data. However for data to be used to their full power, data security and privacy are critical. Even though data security and privacy have been widely investigated over the past thirty years, today we face new difficult data security and privacy challenges. Some of those challenges arise from increasing privacy concerns with respect to the use of data and from the need of reconciling privacy with the use of data for security in applications such as homeland protection, counterterrorism, and health, food and water security. Other challenges arise because the deployments of new data collection and processing devices, such as those used in IoT systems, increase the data attack surface. In this paper, we discuss relevant concepts and approaches for data security and privacy, and identify research challenges that must be addressed by comprehensive solutions to data security and privacy.},   keywords={cloud computing;data analysis;data privacy;security of data;data security;data privacy;sensor systems;cloud computing;data analytics;homeland protection;counterterrorism;health security;food security;water security;IoT systems;data attack surface;Data privacy;Access control;Big data;Data security;Internet of things;Organizations;Big Data;Internet of Things;Sensor Networks;Data Confidentiality;Data Trustworthiness;Application Security},   doi={10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.89},   ISSN={0730-3157},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={914-918},   abstract={The intention of this paper is to make obvious that how the concept of IoT can be used in transforming the health care services. The IoT refers to the physical devices that are interconnected with each other. In the case of Health care services, the medical gadgets like thermometer, ECG, weight scale, etc., are interrelated using certain sensors. It can be used to sense, detect and predict the health condition of the patient. The sensors or actuators attached to the patient will spot out the changes taking place in their body. These details are collected and sent to the databases after undergoing certain stages of processing. The information which gets stored in the database or end systems can be retrieved and utilized whenever it is necessary. Based on those particulars, diagnosis can be performed in an efficient way and as a result the Doctor will be able to provide the appropriate treatment. This method of transformation of the health care services using the Internet of Things can be extended to the next level by implementing it in the rural areas where even the basic medical facilities are denied. In this paper, the details about IoT, its perspectives, its role in the Health Care services, its way of implementation, applications and the challenges faced are explored in a depth. The advancements in IoT based health care systems and the ideas for taking it to the next level, in such a way that, the humanity gets benefitted are also being discussed in this paper.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;IoT based health care systems;health care system;health care services;health condition;Internet of Things;medical facilities;Internet of Things;Intelligent sensors;Hospitals;Semantics;Temperature sensors;IoT;primary health center;health care},   doi={10.1109/IEEM.2017.8290025},   ISSN={2157-362X},   month={Dec},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) is driving an intense research activity targeting novel consumer applications. It has also an industrial counterpart, where thousands of sensors can be connected together into a proprietary network, i.e. into a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Such Industrial WSN may exhibit various shapes for different kind of applications. It can indeed be used for Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) to survey bridges, railways, avionic or automotive structures, rotating machine maintenance prediction, it can also serve security purposes like fire forest detection, border security, etc. In this paper we presents the architecture of a miniaturized and low-frequency piezoelectric-based vibrational-energy harvesting device (PEH) and its advanced manufacturing process flow. This harvesting technique uses direct piezoelectric effect to transform mechanical vibrations into electrical power. Over the past decade, several MEMS architectures have been built and assessed to harvest such low frequency (50-75Hz) vibrations. MEMS based PEH use thin (&lt;;5μm) and thick (&lt;;50μm) piezoelectric films allowing a high degree of integration and miniaturization, but at low frequencies the amount of harvested energy is not enough to power sensing electronics which typically consumes 100μW in average during 200ms. To overcome this limitation, we have developed and optimized a thinning process that enable us to use ultra-thin bulk PZT material (&lt;;20μm) and propose a performant and miniaturized PEH.},   keywords={energy harvesting;micromechanical devices;nondestructive testing;piezoelectric devices;piezoelectric thin films;vibrations;wireless sensor networks;autonomous wireless sensors;miniaturized piezoelectric based energy harvesting devices;NDT applications;Internet of Things;wireless sensor network;advanced manufacturing process flow;direct piezoelectric effect;mechanical vibrations;electrical power;MEMS;piezoelectric films;power sensing electronics;thinning process;frequency 50 Hz to 75 Hz;power 100 muW;Micromechanical devices;Energy harvesting;Vibrations;Computer architecture;Performance evaluation;Frequency measurement;Power generation;piezoelectric;energy harvesting;NDT},   doi={10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0534},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

This has prompted active research in the development of solutions that enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor and evaluate the health of patients in the comfort of their residences. However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented.

 title={Lithe: Lightweight Secure CoAP for the Internet of Things}, 
  year={2013},   volume={13},   number={10},   pages={3711-3720},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},   keywords={Internet of Things;operating systems (computers);personal area networks;protocols;security of data;Lithe;lightweight secure CoAP;Internet of Things;IoT;e-health domain;constrained application protocol;datagram transport layer security;DTLS;6LoWPAN standard;end-to-end security;Contiki operating system;authenticated confidential communication;resource-constrained devices;Protocols;Security;Internet;Payloads;Standards;Encoding;Sensors;CoAP;DTLS;CoAPs;6LoWPAN;security;IoT},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2013.2277656},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={Oct},}

 title={Towards u-health: An indoor 6LoWPAN based platform for real-time healthcare monitoring}, 
  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;real-time healthcare monitoring;ubiquitous healthcare;u-healthcare systems;bluetooth;Zigbee;smart devices;IEEE802.15.4;interoperability problem;communication platform;next generation u-healthcare system;edge router;real-time monitoring;gateway application;TCP client;remote PC;TCP/IP;Internet of Things;Labview program;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Real-time systems;Protocols;Accelerometers;Temperature sensors;6LoWPAN;U-Healthcare;WSN;WBAN;IEEE802.15.4},   doi={10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

For the reason that the sensor devices are battery operated, though the round-robin based Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheduling is the best choice for its high energy and throughput efficiency, the performance degrades as the network scales because of longer frame duration. We address this problem by modelling the network as a tree with interfering links corresponding to the number of devices. We propose a network partitioning approach to reduce these interfering links by extending the tree to a second level. The first level interfering links correspond to optimizing the frame duration where as the second level interfering links correspond to improving the slot utilization. We show that forming this two-level tree is an NP-complete problem by formulating it as a conflict graph. We then propose two polynomial-time algorithms to address offline and online slot allocation requests that resolve these conflicts efficiently by introducing the so called virtual interference links. We illustrate the performance benefits of our proposed algorithms over the conventional round-robin scheduling in terms of improved throughput, scalability and delay.},   keywords={computational complexity;Internet of Things;optimisation;radio links;telecommunication scheduling;time division multiple access;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks;augmented conflict-free scheduling;low power WSN;Internet of Things;IoT;round-robin based TDMA scheduling;time division multiple access scheduling;network partitioning approach;NP-complete problem;two-level tree problem;polynomial-time algorithm;online slot allocation;virtual interference link;wireless sensor network;Interference;Partitioning algorithms;Resource management;Time division multiple access;Throughput;Delays;Wireless sensor networks},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158013},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={14441-14454},   abstract={As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking.

This paper proposes a hybrid security model for securing the diagnostic text data in medical images. The proposed model is developed through integrating either 2-D discrete wavelet transform 1 level (2D-DWT-1L) or 2-D discrete wavelet transform 2 level (2D-DWT-2L) steganography technique with a proposed hybrid encryption scheme. The proposed hybrid encryption schema is built using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard, and Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman algorithms. The proposed model starts by encrypting the secret data; then it hides the result in a cover image using 2D-DWT-1L or 2D-DWT-2L. Both color and gray-scale images are used as cover images to conceal different text sizes. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated based on six statistical parameters; the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), structural similarity (SSIM), structural content (SC), and correlation. The PSNR values were relatively varied from 50.59 to 57.44 in case of color images and from 50.52 to 56.09 with the gray scale images. The MSE values varied from 0.12 to 0.57 for the color images and from 0.14 to 0.57 for the gray scale images. The BER values were zero for both images, while SSIM, SC, and correlation values were ones for both images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model proved its ability to hide the confidential patient's data into a transmitted cover image with high imperceptibility, capacity, and minimal deterioration in the received stego-image.},   keywords={data encapsulation;discrete wavelet transforms;error statistics;health care;image coding;image colour analysis;Internet of Things;mean square error methods;medical information systems;steganography;confidential patient;transmitted cover image;received stego-image;BER values;MSE values;gray scale images;color images;PSNR values;structural content;gray-scale images;secret data;model starts;Advanced Encryption Standard;hybrid encryption scheme;2D-DWT-2L;integrating either 2-D discrete;medical images;diagnostic text data;hybrid security model;healthcare services applications;big challenges;integrity;healthcare sector;significant advancement;healthcare systems;IoT;secure medical data transmission model;text sizes;SSIM;PSNR;peak signal-to-noise ratio;mean square error;MSE;bit error rate;BER;structural similarity;Encryption;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Data models;Cryptography;DWT-1level;DWT-2level;encryption;healthcare services;Internet of Things;medical images;steganography},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817615},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

It depends strongly on the doctors' long-term experience as well as on their different inferences. Being subjective and based on long-term experience, pulse detection methods are difficult to standardize. Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD), established by Wei Jin, is an efficient method validated by both traditional Chinese medicine and in recent years also by western medicine. The key step to automatic implementation of KPD, using signal processing and analysis, is the developed KPD signal acquisition device. However, the raw wrist pulse signal acquired from KPD device includes a significant amount of noise. This paper proposes several preprocessing algorithms for pulse diagnosis, that includes wavelet transform and Gaussian filter to remove noise and the iterative sliding window (ISW) algorithm to remove the baseline wander and split the continuous signal into single periods. Experimental results show, that the algorithm for baseline wander removal is efficient and that the segmented signal matches the signal described in KPD.},   keywords={filtering theory;Gaussian processes;health care;iterative methods;medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;signal denoising;wavelet transforms;traditional Chinese medicine;wrist pulse diagnosis;KPD signal acquisition device;wavelet transform;Gaussian filter;noise removal;iterative sliding window;segmented signal;continuous signal;window algorithm;raw wrist pulse signal;signal processing;western medicine;kim pulse diagnosis;pulse detection methods;health status;KPD based signal preprocessing algorithm;Wrist;Algorithm design and analysis;Wavelet transforms;Adaptive filters;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering algorithms;preprocessing algorithm;Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD);e-noising;terative sliding window (ISW)},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2016.75},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2011},   volume={},   number={},   pages={232-241},   abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are convergence of real physical world and computation world. CPS systems are rapidly becoming an important development strategies with broad application domains. The key requirements for CPS systems are to support multiple applications with many different resources at the same time in timeliness and also ensure energy efficiency. This paper presents the Cyber-Physical integrated cloud computing system called Cyber-Physical Cloud (CPC) to solve these key requirements. CPC architecture is designed for various applications such as health care, smart cars, traffic control, etc where multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) communicate with each other through mobile ad hoc network. Concurrently, CPC architecture can leverage cloud computing to process effectively computation and resource management by virtualization technique. Moreover, CPS systems are built on heterogeneous WSNs to collect and process the physical objects by obtaining data and thereafter processing queries. As a part of CPS systems, the key requirement for WSNs is to sustain a long lifetime because of limited power supplies. We work on real time preemptive query scheduling in WSNs with a focus on quality of data (QoD) to analysis useful energy consumption and interference energy consumption. We propose the Energy efficiency Aware Quality of Data (EAQD) method that runs on real time preemptive query scheduling to find the expected QoD for each query thus enabling energy consumption minimization. EAQD method also computes the transmitting/receiving slots needed for each query to avoid wasting slots. The simulation results show the our approach can reduce energy consumption up to 5 times as compares to previous approaches.},   keywords={cloud computing;energy conservation;health care;energy efficiency;cyber physical system;convergence;real physical world;computation world;CPS system;cloud computing;cyber-physical cloud;CPC architecture;health care;smart car;traffic control;wireless sensor network;mobile ad hoc network;virtualization;real time preemptive query scheduling;quality of data;interference energy consumption;EAQD method;energy consumption minimization;Real time systems;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Computer architecture;Sensors;cyber-physical systems;energy efficiency;quality of data;real time query scheduling},   doi={10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.61},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Most of these applications require a variety of heterogeneous and geographical sensor data to be delivered to users such as mobile devices, vehicles, and cloud systems for big data analysis to extract maximum value from the physical world. Data caching of popular data items in a network can significantly improve efficiency and reliability of content delivery by contributing the reduction of data access delay, bandwidth usage, and packet losses in resource-limited low-rate wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient cache placement protocol (BCDA) that minimizes data access cost and guarantees cache consistency in a lightweight manner. The BCDA decides where to store a copy of data content in a network using a distributed approach according to clients' access patterns, memory capacity, data size, and so on. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness, we implemented the BCDA in ns-2 and compared its performance with existing caching strategies. The simulation results highlight that the BCDA significantly reduces data access cost with minimizing cache management cost.},   keywords={protocols;wireless sensor networks;on-demand cache placement protocol;content delivery sensor networks;Internet of Things;data caching;BCDA;distributed approach;cache management cost},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2017.7876128},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

This poses heterogeneity in data syntax and semantics. In the past few years, researches have been carried out to handle these problems in various information systems such as water and healthcare by applying semantic and syntactic uniformity. This research presents an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework to sustain the interoperability between stakeholders within an information system by applying Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) paradigm and ontology. The major contribution of this research is building software model which is annotated with semantic model to maintain the comprehension between the modelers and the programmers allowing sustainability by adapting to the changing environment. Moreover, the framework offers two types of semantic validation i.e. model and data of the documents to integrate sensor data which we claim as a novelty in this study. The validated IoT data is integrated through RESTful web service interface of SensorThings API. The aim of this paper is to apply the methodology of the framework, on IoT based healthcare system, that has been successful in water information system.},   keywords={application program interfaces;data integration;health care;information systems;Internet;Internet of Things;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;software engineering;Web services;Internet of Things technology;IoT-based information systems;IoT technology;Information and Communication Technology framework;ICT framework;IoT based healthcare system;validated IoT data;sensor data;semantic validation i.e;sustainability;modelers;semantic model;software model;ontology;syntactic uniformity;semantic uniformity;semantics;data syntax;files;disparate databases;data integration;sustainable interoperability;water information system;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Interoperability;Ontologies;Medical services;Adaptation models;Software;Model Driven Software Development;Ontology;Healthcare systems;Semantic Validation;OGC SensorThings},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.126},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game to balance the tradeoff between network performance and security level while taking into account the context dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve an acceptable security level and is more efficient than benchmark algorithms in terms of network lifetime and throughput.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;patient care;quality of service;stochastic games;health domain;ubiquitous healthcare;constant monitoring;wireless body area network;highly suitable communication tool;medical IoT devices;WBAN applications;network lifetime;network throughput;data criticality;QoS requirements;stochastic game;network performance;acceptable security level;constrained wireless body area networks;security effectiveness;Security;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Quality of service;Games;Sensors;Adaptation models;IoT;Health;WBAN;Game theory;Nash Equilibrium Adaptive security;QoS requirements},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2018.8319222},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

While WSN has the abilities of sensing, processing and communication over distances, its abilities are limited by the capacity of its battery. To use the full functionalities of WSN, either the battery needs to replace or recharge in a periodically manner. However both solutions are not convenient for livestock monitoring system. The only way to solve the issue effectively and efficiently is to recharge the battery wirelessly. Due to the harsh operating environment, the sensor node has to be waterproofed within a sealed enclosure which then brings up a mind-boggling challenge of how to charge a battery when it is concealed? Therefore, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) solution seems to be a sole solution to solve the issue in WSN for livestock farming. In this work, we propose a WSN livestock health monitoring system using Near Field Communication (NFC) to monitoring key parameters like temperature to monitor the health of livestock. WPT will also be discussed as how it provides a means for electronic devices to obtain power wirelessly without any physical connectivity to the WSN which is attached to the herds for health monitoring purpose.},   keywords={inductive power transmission;Internet of Things;near-field communication;telecommunication power supplies;wireless sensor networks;field testing;IoT devices;livestock monitoring;wireless sensor network;near field communication;wireless power transfer;wireless communication devices;WSN;harsh operating environment;WPT;livestock farming;health monitoring system;NFC;health monitoring purpose;Wireless sensor networks;Agriculture;Monitoring;Batteries;Temperature sensors;Animals;Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor network;wireless power transfer;livestock monitoring},   doi={10.1109/SusTech.2016.7897161},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={324-330},   abstract={Ahstract- This paper raises an important question on the opportunities offered by millimeter Waves (mm Waves) signals for 3D localization and mapping (3D-LOCMAP) in vehicular and indoor environments. More precisely, the paper presents a technical framework for 3DLOCMAP using the mm Wave channel response and mm Wave propagation characteristics. To do so, the paper firstly introduces a combination between Trian-gulateration (TL) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) or Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements for 3DLOCMAP. In the case of a channel model with single bounce, the environment mapping (such as obstacles) is achieved by estimating the positions of virtual anchor nodes (VANs), known as mirrors of the real anchors with respect to obstacle. Then, the obstacle position and dimensions are found via the estimation of the reflector points on the obstacle. In case of double-bounce, the scenario is observed from single-bounce perspective by estimating Virtual Receiver (VRx), VAN, and two Points of Reflection (PoR). Simulation results have shown the accuracy of the proposed framework which can be extended for further investigations. The work here will open the door for multiple applications in vehicular, robotics, health, radar-like systems, and Internet of Things (IoT).},   keywords={indoor radio;Internet of Things;mobile radio;sensor placement;time-of-arrival estimation;vehicular ad hoc networks;vehicular environments;indoor environments;millimeter Waves signals;3D-LOCMAP;technical framework;mm Wave channel response;mm Wave propagation characteristics;Arrival measurements;channel model;environment mapping;virtual anchor nodes;obstacle position;single-bounce perspective;radar-like systems;Receivers;Three-dimensional displays;Estimation;Simulation;Scattering;Delays;Millimeter wave;Localization;Mapping;Context Inference;Virtual Anchor Node (VAN);Obstacle Detection and Classification},   doi={10.1109/ICT.2018.8464930},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Environmental awareness may help people to take more informed decisions in their everyday lives, ensuring their health and safety. The Web of Things is becoming a reality, as embedded sensors are being deployed in urban areas for environmental monitoring. These sensors are accessible and discoverable through the Web, and their services can be harnessed by mobile users on the go. In this paper, we perform a small case study, by using mini focus groups, to identify the impact of remote sensing on the everyday lives of users. By means of UrbanRadar, an application that discovers and interacts with environmental services offered by Web-enabled urban sensors, we investigate and discuss the acceptance, influence, usefulness and potential of these services to mobile users.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently advanced from an experimental technology to what will become the backbone of future customer value for both product and service sector businesses. This underscores the cardinal role of IoT on the journey towards the fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems. IoT technologies augmented with intelligent and big data analytics are expected to rapidly change the landscape of myriads of application domains ranging from health care to smart cities and industrial automations. The emergence of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) technology aims at extending cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the radio access network, hence providing real-time, high-bandwidth, low-latency access to radio network resources. IoT is identified as a key use case of MEC, given MEC&amp;#x2019;s ability to provide cloud platform and gateway services at the network edge. MEC will inspire the development of myriads of applications and services with demand for ultra low latency and high Quality of Service (QoS) due to its dense geographical distribution and wide support for mobility. MEC is therefore an important enabler of IoT applications and services which require real-time operations. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview on the exploitation of MEC technology for the realization of IoT applications and their synergies. We further discuss the technical aspects of enabling MEC in IoT and provide some insight into various other integration technologies therein.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Edge computing;Internet of Things;5G mobile communication;Security;Computer architecture;Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC);Internet of Things (IoT);5G;edge computing;virtualization;network architecture;latency;reliability.},   doi={10.1109/COMST.2018.2849509},   ISSN={1553-877X},   month={},}

On the one hand, this is leading to an increasing adoption of multi-tenancy solutions for Cloud and Fog Computing, to analyze and store the data produced. On the other hand, power consumption has become a major concern for almost every digital system, from the smallest embedded circuits to the biggest computer clusters, with all the shades in between. Fine-grain control mechanisms are then needed to cap power consumption at each level of the stack, still guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLA) to the hosted applications. In this work, we propose DockerCap, a software-level power capping orchestrator for Docker containers that follows an Observe-Decide-Act loop structure: this allows to quickly react to changes that impact on the power consumption by managing resources of each container at run-time, to ensure the desired power cap. We show how we are able to obtain results comparable with the state of the art power capping solution provided by Intel RAPL, still being able to tune the performances of the containers and even guarantee SLA constraints.},   keywords={contracts;power aware computing;power consumption;resource allocation;virtualisation;software-level power capping orchestrator;Docker containers;DockerCap;observe-decide-act loop structure:;power consumption;Intel RAPL;SLA constraints;service level agreements;resource management;Containers;Mathematical model;Power demand;Resource management;Benchmark testing;Transfer functions;Integrated circuits;Power Management;Docker;Fog Computing},   doi={10.1109/CSE-EUC-DCABES.2016.166},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={147-152},   abstract={In today's world, the rapid advancement of technology allows us to find new solutions to old problems in critical areas, namely patient and staff tracking in healthcare facilities. The medical staff within these facilities are in an environment where they depend on immediately knowing the location of a patient or other medical staff. McAllister et al. [1] proposed a solution named LoCATE (Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment) which uses existing technology to track all patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current wireless networks (e.g., WiFi) within a healthcare facility by using edge node technology as its tracking solution. It can locate an object within three to five feet of its calculated position. The ubiquity of WiFi infrastructure in healthcare facilities makes it an attractive option to use, as the backbone for a patient and staff tracking system. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge nodes create security holes in networks and leak data to the open world. This paper aims to analyze what security holes and data leaks LoCATE creates in a healthcare facility. In this paper, we show the dangers of using simple and default passwords, the need to physically secure edge nodes, and the importance of securing data before transmission. We exploit the system's weak security measures by forging edge node data, gaining unauthorized access, performing denial of service attack, and launching other attacks. We analyze the successfulness of these attacks to offer mitigation techniques for future devices located in other critical areas similar to the healthcare facilities.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;health care;indoor radio;Internet of Things;wireless LAN;medical staff;edge node technology;tracking solution;security holes;physically secure edge nodes;healthcare facilities;data leaks;security analysis;IoT system;indoor localization;LoCATE;localization-of-health center assets-through-an-IoT environment;wireless networks;WiFi infrastructure;staff tracking system;patient tracking system;weak security measures;denial-of-service attack;Medical services;Wireless fidelity;Databases;Password;Wireless communication;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);Localization;Raspberry Pi;security},   doi={10.1109/SIEDS.2018.8374726},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={There are tremendous security concerns with patient health monitoring sensors in Internet of Things (IoT). The concerns are also realized by recent sophisticated security and privacy attacks, including data breaching, data integrity, and data collusion. Conventional solutions often offer security to patients’ health monitoring data during the communication. However, they often fail to deal with complicated attacks at the time of data conversion into cipher and after the cipher transmission. In this paper, we first study privacy and security concerns with healthcare data acquisition and then transmission. Then, we propose a secure data collection scheme for IoT based healthcare system named SecureData with the aim to tackle security concerns similar to the above. SecureData scheme is comprised of four layers: IoT network sensors/devices, Fog layers, Cloud computing layer, and healthcare provider layer. We mainly contribute to the first three layers. For the first two layers, SecureData includes two techniques: light-weight FPGA hardware-based cipher algorithm and secret cipher share algorithm, respectively. We study KATAN algorithm and we implement and optimize it on the FPGA hardware platform, while we use the idea of secret cipher sharing technique to protect patients’ data privacy. At the cloud computing layer, we apply a distributed database technique that includes a number of cloud data servers to guarantee patients’ personal data privacy at the cloud computing layer. The performance of SecureData is validated through simulations with FPGA in terms of hardware frequency rate, energy cost, and computation time of all the algorithms and the results show that SecureData can be efficient when applying for protecting security risks in IoT-based healthcare.},   keywords={Medical services;Ciphers;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Data collection;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;data collection;hardware-based security;threats;secret cipher;privacy;healthcare.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2854714},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Such enormous number of devices connected to internet provides many kinds of services and produce huge amount of data and information. Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. compute, networks, servers, storage, applications, services, and software) that can be easily provisioned as Infrastructure (IaaS), software and applications (SaaS). Cloud based platforms help to connect to the things (IaaS) around us so that we can access anything at any time and any place in a user friendly manner using customized portals and in built applications (SaaS). Hence, cloud acts as a front end to access Internet of Things. Applications that interact with devices like sensors have special requirements of massive storage to storage big data, huge computation power to enable the real time processing of the data, and high speed network to stream audio or video.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={118-123},   abstract={Rural and urban areas are linked. A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes "in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand". This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], "more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products; the majority of these people live in developing countries" [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] "the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks". In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

 title={An Internet of Things (IOT) based monitoring system for efficient milk distribution}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Milk distribution and safety is of high concern as it involves the health of 90% of our society. Our project, milk distribution monitoring system targets the cold chain maintenance and milk spoilage avoidance. The system is based on Internet of Things and data mining. Traditionally milk is supplied in cans with minimum monitoring which may result in milk getting spoiled before its use specially during transportation at any point of time which causes vendors to know about milk spoilage only after the milk has been spoiled completely. To overcome these problems first data mining technique is employed to discover the routing plans so as to generate case-based routing plans for the drivers. Then the existing sensor based system will measure the pH value of milk and determine its quality. The system will direct to nearest milk booth with the highest proximity by using routing technique where data center serves as a cloud server to calculate the costs of a finding the nearest milk booth request, and these costs will be frequently updated by considering the location of van and the total number of milk booth in each areas whose data is accessible any time in the network. This routing algorithm will be used to offer a solution of finding an available milk booth if the PH value deviates from 6.7. This is implemented by a system prototype with wireless access in an open-source physical computing platform based on Ardiuno and using a smart phone that provides the communication and user interface for both the control system and the vehicles to verify the feasibility of the system. It will also give an alert SMS to vehicle driver so that collection of milk can be faster without more spoilage. This way it will maintain good quality and cost effective distribution of milk.},   keywords={cloud computing;dairy products;data mining;goods dispatch data processing;graphical user interfaces;Internet of Things;data mining technique;system prototype;milk distribution monitoring system;Internet of Things-based monitoring system;cold chain maintenance;milk spoilage avoidance;case-based routing plans;sensor based system;pH value;data center serves;cloud server;open-source physical computing platform;Ardiuno;smart phone;user interface;alert SMS;milk booth;IoT-based monitoring system;Dairy products;Real-time systems;Routing;Clustering algorithms;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Internet of Things;Data mining;Intelligent Transportation System;optimization;real-time vehicle routing;Variable Neighborhood Search},   doi={10.1109/ICAC3.2017.8318780},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.},   keywords={application program interfaces;health care;medical computing;medical disorders;mobile computing;pattern recognition;Alzimio app;dementia;autism;Alzheimers disorder;activity recognition algorithms;mobile app;safe-zone geofencing;smartphones;threshold-based algorithms;Android API;max-in-window algorithm;Smart phones;Sensors;Autism;Dementia;Algorithm design and analysis},   doi={10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501720},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

What also must be considered is the paradigm of the Internet of Things which is rapidly gaining prevalence within the field of wireless communications, being incorporated into areas such as e-health and automation for industrial manufacturing. As critical infrastructures and the Internet of Things begin to integrate into much wider networks, their reliance upon communication assets by third parties to ensure collaboration and control of their systems will significantly increase, along with system complexity and the requirement for improved security metrics. We present a critical analysis of the risk assessment methods developed for generating attack graphs. The failings of these existing schemas include the inability to accurately identify the relationships and interdependencies between the risks and the reduction of attack graph size and generation complexity. Many existing methods also fail due to the heavy reliance upon the input, identification of vulnerabilities, and analysis of results by human intervention.

Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage. The analyzed sensor data is sent back to the mobile application on the smartphone for real-time visualization if required.},   keywords={biosensors;Bluetooth;cloud computing;data analysis;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;middleware;mobile computing;patient monitoring;smart phones;data communication;data processing;data collection;IoT solutions;analyzing data;IoT devices;healthcare services;real-time analytical results;edge analytics platform;data analysis;physiological data;mobile application;edge computing platform server;cloud computing services;storage services;data integration;edge analysis leveraging;Internet of Things based healthcare solutions;sensor data analysis;HealthMate;middleware platform;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Medical services;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Biomedical monitoring;Servers;edge analysis;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);Kaa IoT Platform;mobile application;remote patient monitoring},   doi={10.1109/NIGERCON.2017.8281940},   ISSN={2377-2697},   month={Nov},}

There is no debate among security experts that the security of Internet-enabled medical devices is crucial, and an ongoing threat vector is insider attacks. In this paper, we focus on the identification of insider attacks in healthcare SDNs. Specifically, we survey stakeholders from 12 healthcare organizations (i.e., two hospitals and two clinics in Hong Kong, two hospitals and two clinics in Singapore, and two hospitals and two clinics in China). Based on the survey findings, we develop a trust-based approach based on Bayesian inference to figure out malicious devices in a healthcare environment. Experimental results in either a simulated and a real-world network environment demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach regarding the detection of malicious healthcare devices, i.e., our approach could decrease the trust values of malicious devices faster than similar approaches.},   keywords={Bayes methods;computer network security;health care;inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;medical information systems;software defined networking;trusted computing;insider attacks;healthcare software-defined networks;medical industry;network control;medical devices;healthcare SDNs;Bayesian inference;malicious devices;healthcare environment;real-world network environment;malicious healthcare devices;Bayesian-based trust management;Internet of Medical Things environment;Medical services;Organizations;Wireless sensor networks;Security;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;software-defined networking;trust computation and management;healthcare network;Bayesian inference},   doi={10.1109/TNSM.2018.2815280},   ISSN={1932-4537},   month={June},}

 title={PESA: Probabilistic Efficient Storage Algorithm for Time-Domain Spectrum Measurements}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Wireless communication is an essential part of daily life for users globally with applications in medical devices, cellular phones, Internet of Things nodes, and others. Accordingly, there is a need to understand the patterns and properties of radio-frequency spectrum use by acquiring accurate spectrum utilization measurements. However, the massive storage volume needed to execute spectrum surveys-especially when a fast sampling rate is used--is an impeding factor in terms of cost and ease-of-access. In this paper, a probabilistic efficient storage algorithm (PESA) is proposed to facilitate high-accuracy, time-domain spectrum surveys conducted at a fast sample acquisition rate to detect sporadic spectrum occupancy patterns that could be in the order of microseconds. PESA divides the dynamic range of monitoring equipment into bins--each represented by one component of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Windows of activity and inactivity in the measurements are established by comparing with a threshold, and then indicators to the GMM component that best describes a window are recorded, hence reducing the required storage volume. Results demonstrate that ≈99% reduction in the storage volume is achievable while maintaining an accurate estimation of channel utilization (CU) and activity/inactivity periods. Furthermore, a LabVIEW implementation of PESA on a hardware platform was executed and used to survey Wi-Fi channel 1 in a healthcare environment for seven consecutive hours. Although more than 25 billion samples were observed, the resulting data only occupied 96.28 MB.},   keywords={Wireless communication;Time-domain analysis;Wireless fidelity;Volume measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Time-frequency analysis;Cognitive radio;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Internet of Things (IoT);spectrum survey;Wi-Fi;wireless coexistence},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2018.2851678},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={},}

Its advances, among other things, enable new opportunities for better health services but, as a side effect, it introduces new threats to privacy. If anywhere, it is in the health care sector that privacy is of utmost importance. Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most "primitive" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning. This latter contribution also paves the way for further development and for applications of pervasive computing in general.},   keywords={biomedical communication;computer network security;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;radiofrequency identification;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks;hard security provisioning;soft security provisioning;computationally weak pervasive computing systems;electronic health;e-health;health care sector;data privacy;Internet of Things technology;primitive member;bare sensors;RFID;wireless medical sensor deployment;body area network deployment;Protocols;Security;Computer security;Logic gates;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;Electronic medical records;Medical services;Pervasive computing},   doi={10.1109/MWC.2013.6590047},   ISSN={1536-1284},   month={August},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={373-378},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as billions of devices and wirelessly connected systems will soon be adopting various IoT technologies and exchanging potentially sensitive information. IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities.

While these sensor systems serve as valuable tools for managing the comfort and health of occupants, there is an increasing need to expand the deployment of sensors to provide additional insights. Because many of these desired insights have high temporal value, such as occupancy during emergency situations, such insights are needed in real time. However, augmenting buildings with new sensors is often expensive and requires a significant capital investment. In this paper, we propose and describe the real-time, streaming system called Namatad that we developed to infer insights from many sensors typical of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. We evaluate the effectiveness of this platform by leveraging machine learning to infer new insights from environmental sensors within buildings. We describe how we built the components of our system leveraging several open source, streaming frameworks. We also describe how we ingest and aggregate from building sensors and sensing platforms, route data streams to appropriate models, and make predictions using machine learning techniques.

Conventional air pollution monitoring systems install a few highly accurate, expensive stations at representative locations. Their sparse coverage and low spatial resolution are insufficient to quantify urban air pollution and its impacts on human health and environment. Advances in low-cost portable air pollution sensors have enabled air pollution monitoring deployments at scale to measure air pollution at high spatiotemporal resolution. However, it is challenging to ensure the accuracy of these low-cost sensor deployments because the sensors are more error-prone than high-end sensing infrastructures and they are often deployed in harsh environments. Sensor calibration has proven to be effective to improve the data quality of low-cost sensors and maintain the reliability of long-term, distributed sensor deployments. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art low-cost air pollution sensors, identify their major error sources, and comprehensively survey calibration models as well as network re-calibration strategies suited for different sensor deployments.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Sterilization in hospitals is performed due to the need of attacking and killing bacteria that can be dangerous for patients when intervened with medical instrumentation. In that sense, sterilization autoclaves are used, and controlling both temperature and pressure, bacteria are killed. Nonetheless, in some cases the level of humidity in the internal atmosphere is highly relevant to guarantee the success of the process. This variable is controlled by knowing the steam quality, however, it is not monitored online, but sampling is performed a few times a year, so pertinent adjustments are carried out into the boiler when needed. This periodic maintenance does not guarantee that the process is effective. On the other hand, instruments for monitoring steam quality are expensive, and cannot be afforded by many hospitals. As a result, a cheaper determination of steam quality is carried out by using chemical instruments like test tubes, adding critical errors in the measurements. In this paper a cost-effective measuring and processing method by implementing Internet of Things - IoT-techniques is proposed, based on strangulation calorimeter. All the calculations are performed in a Single Board Computer which is connected to an IoT platform for logging data, supervise in pseudo real time and use statistical tools to inference or predict. As a result, the IoT node can achieve measurement errors up to 0.25% FS, against 5.6% FS of traditional method. Furthermore, the inclusion of pseudo real time monitoring, allows maintenance staff to fix problems even in a predictive way.},   keywords={computerised monitoring;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;measurement errors;microorganisms;steam;sterilisation (microbiological);hospitals;chemical instruments;pseudoreal time monitoring;health sterilization;electronic instrumentation;medical instrumentation;sterilization autoclaves;cost-effective processing method;bacteria;cost-effective measuring method;IoT-techniques;Internet of Things baseline method;steam quality processing;steam quality monitoring;measurement errors;Instruments;Hospitals;Temperature measurement;Liquids;Microorganisms;Internet of Things;Containers;Internet of Things;hospital;instrumentation;sterilization;steam quality},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399370},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, such applications generate large amounts of real-time data in terms of volume, velocity, and variety thus making it a big data problem. Hence, the challenge is how to combine and analyse such data with historical patient data to obtain meaningful diagnoses suggestions within acceptable time frames (considering quality of service (QoS)).

Continuous health monitoring can provide medical services that consider the current medical state of the patient and to predict or early-detect future potentially critical situations. In this regard, Internet of Things as a multidisciplinary paradigm can provide profound impacts. However, the current IoT-based systems may encounter difficulties to provide continuous and real time patient monitoring due to issues in data analytics.

 title={The Accuracy and Efficacy of Real-Time Compressed ECG Signal Reconstruction on a Heterogeneous Multicore Edge-Device}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={458-463},   abstract={Typical real-time remote health monitoring architectures consist of wearable medical devices continuously transmitting physiological signals to a nearby gateway which routes the data to an remote internet of things (IoT)-platform. Unfortunately, this model falls-short under the strict requirements of healthcare systems. Wearable medical devices have short battery lifespans, the system reliance on a cloud makes it vulnerable to connectivity and latency issues, and there are privacy concerns related to streaming sensitive medical data to remote servers. The compressive sensing (CS) scheme has been explored in the context of bio-signals to reduce the energy consumption of wearable sensors. However, CS does not address the other limitations caused by the model's reliance on cloud-computing but exacerbates the associated computing latency by requiring a computationally complex reconstruction process. In our remote elderly monitoring system, we attempt to address this weakness by developing a gateway-centric connected health system, where most signal processing and analysis occurs locally on heterogeneous multicore edge-devices. This paper explores the efficacy of real-time reconstruction of ECG signals, compressed under the CS scheme, on an IoT-gateway powered by ARM's big. LITTLE multicore solution at different signal dimension and allocated computational resources. Experimental results show the gateway's capability to reconstruct ECG signals in real-time, even when considering dimensionally large windows and minimum computational resources. Moreover, they demonstrate that utilizing more cores for the reconstruction process has a higher impact on execution time and is more energy efficient than increasing the cores' frequency. The optimal resource allocation for the majority of cases is a single big (A15) core at minimum frequency as it provides extreme fast reconstruction while consuming less or slightly more energy than its LITTLE (A7) counterpart. Heterogeneous multicore devices have the computational capacity and energy efficiency to elevate some of the limitations of a cloud-based remote health monitoring and can help create a more sustainable IoT-based connected health.},   keywords={Multicore processing;Real-time systems;Electrocardiography;Sensors;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Microsoft Windows;Remote health monitoring;connected health;compressive sensing;heterogeneous multicore platforms;edge computing},   doi={10.1109/DSD.2018.00082},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Thus, a new generation of smart wearable devices for health monitoring is being developed, able to perform complex Digital Signal Processing (DSP) routines that extract features of clinical relevance from the acquired data. These new edge computing sensors for personalized healthcare must operate within a tight energy envelope; addressing the ensuing challenge, we herein introduce an inexact and heterogeneous edge computing architecture, specifically tailored to the bio-DSP domain. We observe that bio-signal analysis applications present task-level parallelism, intensive computational hotspots and a high degree of resilience towards errors. These characteristics drive our new bio-DSP edge node architecture design composed of multiple processing cores, a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerator, and hardware-software co-design support to become resilient to a non-zero probability of bit-flips at runtime. All these characteristics enable our new bio-DSP architecture to operate with an ultra-low voltage operating point. Indeed our results indicate that the energy benefits attained from the inclusion of all these characteristics in bio-DSP architectures are more than additive: task parallelism is harnessed both at the processor and the accelerator level, and the high tolerance of the CGRA towards voltage down-scaling is exploited to further decrease the IoT edge bio-DSP system energy envelope.},   keywords={Kernel;Random access memory;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Runtime;Synchronization;Sensors},   doi={10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351595},   ISSN={2379-447X},   month={May},}

Since WSN can both sense the environment and apply algorithms to process the data, more real-time and useful information can be gathered from the physical world than using traditional sensing systems. These networks can also be integrated into the "Internet of Things" in order to allow collaboration and wider access to sensor data.

This digital transformation is paving the way to new forms of care based on real-time analysis of huge amounts of data produced by sensors, which is seen as a basis for improving clinical efficiency and helping to save lives. A medical sensor typically produces several KBs of data per second so the collection and analysis of these data can be approached with Big Data technologies. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate a hybrid architecture for real-time anomaly detection from data streams coming from sensors attached to patients. The architecture includes an edge computing data staging platform based on Raspberry Pi 3 for data logging, data transformation in RDF triple and data streaming towards a cluster computing running Apache Kafka for collecting RDFStreams, Apache Flink for running a parallel version of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm and Cassandra for data storing.

 title={Available Forward Road Capacity Detection Algorithms to Reduce Urban Traffic Congestion}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={110-119},   abstract={Road congestion is a complex, significant and continuing problem and is a major factor in reduced air quality. This project is concerned with urban road systems and traffic signal control. The work presents the algorithms employed by experimental traffic signals used in a simulated road network. The network is a grid system that is specifically contrived to exhibit highly interactive tidal congestion. The available forward road capacity (AFRC) algorithm is presented as an extension of existing MOVA control algorithms. The objective of providing maximum junction utilisation under congested conditions is explained along with the proposed solution. AFRC automatically determines the temporal and geographic boundaries of congestion and attempts to resolve the problem across multiple junctions without the need for prior knowledge of traffic flows. The system is therefore self-organising and, as a result, is able to respond to dynamic and unanticipated flow changes without manual reconfiguration. Simulation results are presented which compare the action of MOVA and AFRC detection in managing high density congestion across the multiple junction network. The results obtained show that delays can be significantly reduced in periods of congestion and that the performance improvement increases as the road becomes more congested. Reducing overall congestion duration generates time savings for individuals and a reduction in the negative effects on the environment and public health, increased fuel efficiency and reduced fuel waste. The main benefits of the system are equally applicable to all powered transport systems regardless of fuel source or control method including autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with V2X communication. The controller is an ongoing development and is capable of directly and accurately measuring the degree of congestion providing metrics that may be used for other controls including gating and active traffic guidance.},   keywords={road traffic control;road vehicles;available forward road capacity detection algorithms;road congestion;reduced air quality;urban road systems;traffic signal control;experimental traffic signals;simulated road network;grid system;highly interactive tidal congestion;MOVA control algorithms;maximum junction utilisation;congested conditions;temporal boundaries;geographic boundaries;multiple junctions;dynamic flow changes;unanticipated flow changes;multiple junction network;congestion duration;powered transport systems;fuel source;active traffic guidance;urban traffic congestion reduction;AFRC algorithm;forward road capacity algorithm;high density congestion management;fuel efficiency;autonomous vehicles;V2X communication;Junctions;Timing;Roads;Detectors;Vehicle dynamics;Traffic control;Traffic;Vehicle;congestion;delay;control;signal;pollution;air quality},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.22},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

 title={Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={99-104},   abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},   keywords={application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;open systems;real-time systems;secure health care services;OAuth 2.0;JSON Web token;IoT cloud scenario;authorization framework;real time clinical care;automatic monthly payments;bank account;phishing attack;interoperable API;Medical services;Authorization;Servers;Authentication;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;OAuth 2.0;Json Web Token;IOT;Authorization},   doi={10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Considering these problems for elderly we propose a fall detection system for elderly based on computer vision technology. Considering advantages of this technology over wearable based sensor such patients don't need to wear any sensor on body avoiding discomfort due to wearable one. We propose a system in which it is able to detect fall event by detecting features from scene captured by single camera. Features detected are orientation angle, aspect ratio, centre of mass and Hu moment invariants. To reduce computation time in real situation minimum features are used to detect fall. We have also applied IOT (Internet of Things) approach to notify about accident through email with attached screenshot of scene and video recorded after fall. One can also view live streaming of room by entering IP address of raspberry pi on browser if he wishes to see.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Predictive analytics and event forecasting using deep learning techniques require processing long–term historical data which is infeasible in low–power wearable devices. Such devices are constrained in memory and computational power, and are pushed to their limits by resource hungry deep neural networks. Current techniques either ignore historical data, or convert temporal sequences to pattern sequences, eliminating valuable properties such as time and/or recency. The proposed model maps arbitrary–length multivariate discrete time series to a concise sequence, called mapped interval sequence (MIS). MIS retains original data properties such as time, recency, and scale, without being susceptible to missing values. Life Model for time series (LMts) mapping, is capable of mapping billions of data elements with sampling rate of several kHz or higher into a sequence of 32 elements or fewer. Furthermore, a new loss function called as tolerance error is introduced to improve long-term forecasting events using LMts. In a smart health internet of things environment, LMts enables real–time health predictions depending on both recent and historical data. In addition, the LMts model can predict the approximate time of events, with granularity of seconds and up to years. Experimental results show that, compared to previous studies in fall prediction, LMts achieves the same 100% accuracy with a single long short–term memory layer, while covering 16× longer time period and using 80× less weight parameters. LMts is also used to forecast human fall up to 14 seconds in advance even with 50% missing values.},   keywords={Temporal sequences;internet of things (IoT);biomedical wearable devices;long short–term memory (LSTM);health analytics;deep learning.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2863039},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In this paper, an IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation system was introduced which was based on a smart wearable armband (SWA), machine learning (ML) algorithms, and a 3-D printed dexterous robot hand. User comfort is one of the key issues which should be addressed for wearable devices. The SWA was developed by integrating a low-power and tiny-sized IoT sensing device with textile electrodes, which can measure, pre-process, and wirelessly transmit bio-potential signals. By evenly distributing surface electrodes over user's forearm, drawbacks of classification accuracy poor performance can be mitigated. A new method was put forward to find the optimal feature set. ML algorithms were leveraged to analyze and discriminate features of different hand movements, and their performances were appraised by classification complexity estimating algorithms and principal components analysis. According to the verification results, all nine gestures can be successfully identified with an average accuracy up to 96.20%. In addition, a 3-D printed five-finger robot hand was implemented for hand rehabilitation training purpose. Correspondingly, user's hand movement intentions were extracted and converted into a series of commands which were used to drive motors assembled inside the dexterous robot hand. As a result, the dexterous robot hand can mimic the user's gesture in a real-time manner, which shows the proposed system can be used as a training tool to facilitate rehabilitation process for the patients after stroke.},   keywords={biomechanics;dexterous manipulators;electromyography;feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;principal component analysis;wearable computers;IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation system;smart wearable armband;machine learning;surface electromyography signal;hand function recovery training;SWA;user comfort;wearable devices;IoT sensing device;textile electrodes;bio-potential signals;surface electrodes;classification accuracy poor performance;optimal feature set;ML algorithms;different hand movements;five-finger robot hand;hand rehabilitation training purpose;rehabilitation process;3D printed dexterous robot hand;user hand movement intentions;Robots;Training;Electrodes;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Three-dimensional displays;sEMG control;stroke rehabilitation;IoT-enabled wearable device;machine learning},   doi={10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2822681},   ISSN={2168-2372},   month={},}

A setup where wirelessly powered electronic devices are deployed on the human body is both very appealing and very challenging. Indeed, autonomous sensors that are unobtrusively integrated into the wearer's jacket may monitor body parameters and the user's environment while remaining invisible to the mobile user as well as to other persons in his/her proximity. Unfortunately, the body-centric environment is one of the hardest configurations to implement such a wireless transfer, given the movement of the wearers and the potential health hazards associated to the exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields.},   keywords={},   doi={10.1109/URSI-AT-RASC.2015.7302828},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Most countries are trying to introduce and disseminate telemedicine service (TMS) to decrease the necessary budget for health services. However, many doctors are concerned about the security of telemedicine services. Security of medical information should be reinforced for widespread use of telemedicine. This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats. This paper considers the security aspects of telemedicine and the Internet of things (IoT) together, because, after all, healthcare-devices perform a function of telecommunication. This paper reviews the necessity and strategy for enhancing security of medical information systems.

 title={Health 4.0: The case of multiple sclerosis}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and variable disease in matters of symptoms, clinical course and outcome. The ultimate goal of currently used drugs and therapeutic strategies is the control of disease activity and the delay of the ongoing disability. During the last decades, a number of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), all products of advanced biotechnology are being used. However, these DMDs are yet partially effective since the ongoing disability progression may hardly be prevented. There is growing evidence that these DMDs might be more effective if more accurate monitoring of the disease itself throughout a period of time might be available. In the new era of MS treatment and on the basis of our current knowledge about MS management, it became pretty clear that the overall therapeutic strategy should always be scheduled on strictly individualized basis. To this, MS patients should be encouraged to take control over their own disease and collaborate more effectively with their doctors. The advent of the IoT (Internet of Things) and 5G mobile technologies can support patients in this direction. Since a snapshot of the overall patient's condition during a regular follow-up visit may not represent the every day reality of the patient, the advice given under these conditions may not be that effective. However, if hard data on the patient's motoric and cognitive performance were available “theragnostics” might be much more effective and efficient and a typical flare-up of the condition might be recognized much earlier - or even anticipated. Health 4.0 is the translation of Industrie 4.0 design principles into the health domain [36]. Health 4.0 is based on the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of cyber-physical systems to connect the physical and the virtual world. The use of smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors and cyber-physical systems in the management of MS could optimize the accuracy and allow for a precise mapping of symptoms over time which is an inevitable prerequisite for personalization of care. Ideally captured data would be processed in real time in order to flag problems up to the care team and on an individual basis anticipate motoric and / or cognitive deficits in an attempt to compensate for neurological deficits. 5G networks are expected to provide the infrastructure and ease in supporting various parameters recording on a real time basis. Relevant clinical studies may further highlight the need of information communication technology in MS management, thus contributing to the overall improvement of patent's quality of life (QoL). This is an absolute necessity for a variable, fluctuating and largely unpredictable disease such as MS.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;biotechnology;cognition;cyber-physical systems;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;patient treatment;Health 4.0:;disease- modifying drugs;(DMDs);advanced biotechnology;disability progression;disease monitoring;MS treatment;MS management;overall therapeutic strategy;MS patients;IoT;Internet of Things;5G mobile technologies;patient motoric performance;patient cognitive performance;cyber-physical systems;smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors;neurological deficits;5G networks;quality-of-life;QoL;Multiple Sclerosis;5G networks;e/m-Health;Cyber-physical systems;Health 4.0;Theragnostics;Smart pharmaceuticals;IoT;Individualized Medicine},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2016.7749437},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={677-682},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is nowadays increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected devices uniquely addressable, via a standard communication protocol. Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested by analyzing healthcare data sets, mainly comprises of activities including walking, running, ECG. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core™i5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. The results show that the proposed architecture efficiently analyze the massive volume of data with a maximum throughput.},   keywords={Big Data;electrocardiography;gait analysis;health care;Internet of Things;Big data;Internet of Things;dynamic data;computational efficiency;healthcare data sets;walking;running;ECG;Hadoop single node setup;UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core i5 machine;Social network services;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks;Accelerometers;Decision making;Servers;IoT;healthcare;architecture;efficiency;throughput},   doi={10.1109/ICSensT.2015.7438483},   ISSN={2156-8073},   month={Dec},}

It creates unhygienic condition for the people and creates bad ugliness around the surroundings. This leads in spreading some deadly diseases &amp; human illness, to avoid such a situation we are planning to design Solid Waste Management using Smart Bin. This will help to provide a better standard of living for people.

 title={IOT based smart garbage alert system using Arduino UNO}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1028-1034},   abstract={Waste management is one of the primary problem that the world faces irrespective of the case of developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor &amp;amp; ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management. This paper proposes a smart alert system for garbage clearance by giving an alert signal to the municipal web server for instant cleaning of dustbin with proper verification based on level of garbage filling. This process is aided by the ultrasonic sensor which is interfaced with Arduino UNO to check the level of garbage filled in the dustbin and sends the alert to the municipal web server once if garbage is filled. After cleaning the dustbin, the driver confirms the task of emptying the garbage with the aid of RFID Tag. RFID is a computing technology that is used for verification process and in addition, it also enhances the smart garbage alert system by providing automatic identification of garbage filled in the dustbin and sends the status of clean-up to the server affirming that the work is done. The whole process is upheld by an embedded module integrated with RF ID and IOT Facilitation. The real time status of how waste collection is being done could be monitored and followed up by the municipality authority with the aid of this system. In addition to this the necessary remedial / alternate measures could be adapted. An Android application is developed and linked to a web server to intimate the alerts from the microcontroller to the urban office and to perform the remote monitoring of the cleaning process, done by the workers, thereby reducing the manual process of monitoring and verification. The notifications are sent to the Android application using Wi-Fi module.},   keywords={file servers;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;waste management;Wi-Fi module;Android application;cleaning process;IOT facilitation;RFID tag;ultrasonic sensor;municipal Web server;garbage clearance;smart alert system;garbage management;smart intelligent garbage alert system;developing country;developed country;waste management;Arduino UNO;Radiofrequency identification;Monitoring;Acoustics;Embedded systems;Diseases;Radio frequency;Waste management;RFID;MSL;e-Monitoring;Arduino UNO;Wi-Fi;Ultrasonic Sensor},   doi={10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848162},   ISSN={2159-3450},   month={Nov},}

Due to time constraint, people are not visiting hospitals, which might and possibly lead to a lot of health issues in one instant of time. Predominantly most of the healthcare systems have been developed to predict and diagnose the health of the patients by which people who are busy in their schedule can also monitor their health at regular intervals. Many studies show that early prediction is the best way to cure health because early diagnosis will help and alert the patients to know the health status. Healthcare being a global issue more particularly India being a most populated nation where majority of which live in villages deprived of healthcare facilities on real time basis continuously and regularly. With the increasing use of technology, there is an urgent need to have such a smart health monitoring system that can communicate between network devices and application which will help the patients and doctors to monitor, track and record the patient's sensitive data containing medical information. This paper depicts the idea of solving health issues using the latest technology, Internet of Things (IoT). It presents the architectural review of smart healthcare system using Internet of Things(IoT) which is aimed to provide a Better HealthCare to everyone. Using this system architecture, patient's body parameters can be measured in real time. Sensors collect patients body parameters and transfers that data to Microcontroller ATMEL 89s52 which further transfer that data to the MySQL database server. This MySQL database server manages the data and provides accessibility. The patient can view this data with the help of Android App. Which one can install in Smartphone, or Tablet. If data is abnormal then patient gets notification also care takers will get emergency message.

In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body.

In case of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) that is based on the sensor network is usually deployed for single application. However, the future of WSNs based on sensors lies in the multiple application support and the aggregation of resources either in the form of hardware or software. To deal with the challenges of aggregation of sensors in the health care environment, virtualization of a sensor network is an evolving concept that enables aggregation of multiple independent heterogeneous sensor networks under one roof. In order to virtualize the sensors and networks, middleware layer role is the most dominant one. Furthermore, middleware for sensors poses the overhead challenges like processing time, memory utilization, sampling rate, delay, and power consumption. In this paper efforts have been put forward by proposing a middleware framework for sensor network that uses multi-threading technique that increases the sampling frequency and reduces the delay caused by the hardware abstraction layer that resides on top each sensor node.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={559-564},   abstract={Campuses and cities of the near future will be equipped with vast numbers of IoT devices. Operators of such environments may not even be fully aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This paper proposes the use of network traffic analytics to characterize IoT devices, including their typical behaviour mode. We first collect and synthesize traffic traces from a smart-campus environment instrumented with a diversity of IoT devices including cameras, lights, appliances, and health-monitors; our traces, collected over a period of 3 weeks, are released as open data to the public.

Finally, using these attributes, we develop a classification method that can not only distinguish IoT from non-IoT traffic, but also identify specific IoT devices with over 95% accuracy.

IoT allows the information collected by smart devices to be transmitted to the people across the globe through Internet and enhancing people's lives in many aspects, such as health, energy, transportation, etc. In IoT, the communication between device-to-device or device-to-people very often go through different domains each having separate trust authority. Therefore, maintaining trust in the federated network of IoT is really important. However, IoT is vulnerable to numerous threats like tampering of information and key distribution issue, while considering the constraint in its resource. This paper proposes a method to secure communication that manages trust of IoT in federated fashion while minimizing usage of resources in IoT devices. Other aspects of loosely/tightly coupled network federation, dynamic nature of IoT devices in the network and the security analysis will also be discussed in the paper.},   keywords={cryptography;Internet of Things;security of data;smart phones;telecommunication security;virtual worlds;physical worlds;smart devices;device-to-device;IoT devices;identity-based cryptography;trust authority;Authentication;Cryptography;Logic gates;Mobile communication;Machine-to-machine communications;Internet;Authentication;ID-based cryptography;federation;IoT},   doi={10.1109/IWBIS.2017.8275115},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={364-369},   abstract={Epileptic seizure detection could be detected through investigating the electroencephalography (EEG), which is deemed to be very important for IoT wearable sensor-based health systems. EEG-based classification is crucial for a wide-range of applications to analyze real-time vital signs using features concerning predefined set of data classes. The aim of this paper is to conduct a comparative study for several classification techniques and demonstrate the effect of uncertainty in the EEG data on the classification accuracy. We define a model for decomposing the EEG using various transformation such as discrete cosine transform, discrete wavelet transform into several sub-bands. After feature extraction, a comparative study to assess the classification algorithms' performance is conducted. In addition, we evaluate their overall accuracy and complexity as performance measures. For this purpose, we use the support vector machine (SVM) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These are chosen as classifier models to study the performance of the obtained features. The discussion will include the evaluation of the classifiers' performance using the EEG-based epileptic seizure data in two categories, noiseless and noisy. In addition, there are some statistical features extracted to characterize the complete EEG data feeding to these two classifiers. A publically available EEG dataset is employed for both normal and epileptic seizure for automatic epileptic seizure detection as a benchmark.},   keywords={discrete cosine transforms;discrete wavelet transforms;electroencephalography;feature extraction;Internet of Things;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neural nets;signal classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines;complete EEG data;normal seizure;automatic epileptic seizure detection;imperfect EEG epileptic seizure;IoT applications;IoT wearable sensor-based health systems;EEG-based classification;real-time vital signs;predefined set;data classes;classification techniques;classification accuracy;feature extraction;classification algorithms;performance measures;classifier models;statistical features;discrete cosine transform;discrete wavelet transform;EEG-based epileptic seizure data;electroencephalography;support vector machine;SVM;artificial neural network;ANN;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Epilepsy;Classification algorithms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Noise measurement;IoT;EEG;epileptic seizure;feature extraction;classifiers;classification accuracy},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450279},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={880-887},   abstract={With the need for increased care and welfare of the rapidly aging population, mobile telemedicine is becoming popular for providing remote health care to increase the quality of life. Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the “edge”, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920×1080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3×3 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.},   keywords={cellular neural nets;edge detection;floating point arithmetic;health care;image segmentation;Internet of Things;medical image processing;mobile computing;telemedicine;rapidly aging population;mobile telemedicine;remote health care;image analysis;medical diagnosis;image processing;high-resolution images;real-time constraints;segmentation results;cellular neural network;real-time medical image segmentation;low power mobile computing platforms;compressed CeNN framework;edge segmentation;compressed cellular neural networks;4-8 Giga floating point multiplications},   doi={10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203873},   ISSN={1558-2434},   month={Nov},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={117-128},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we interact with everyday objects. "Smart" devices will reduce energy use, keep our homes safe, and improve our health. However, as recent attacks have shown, these devices also create tremendous security vulnerabilities in our computing networks. Securing all of these devices is a daunting task. In this paper, we argue that IoT device communications should be default-off and desired network communications must be explicitly enabled. Unlike traditional networked applications or devices like a web browser or PC, IoT applications and devices serve narrowly defined purposes and do not require access to all services in the network. Our proposal, Bark, a policy language and runtime for specifying and enforcing minimal access permissions in IoT networks, exploits this fact. Bark phrases access control policies in terms of natural questions (who, what, where, when, and how) and transforms them into transparently enforceable rules for IoT application protocols. Bark can express detailed rules such as "Let the lights see the luminosity of the bedroom sensor at any time" and "Let a device at my front door, if I approve it, unlock my smart lock for 30 seconds" in a way that is presentable and explainable to users. We implement Bark for Wi-Fi/IP and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks and evaluate its efficacy on several example applications and attacks.},   keywords={authorisation;Bluetooth;Internet;Internet of Things;default-off networking;Smart devices;IoT device communications;web browser;policy language;minimal access permissions;IoT networks;Bark phrases access control policies;IoT application protocols;smart lock;Bluetooth Low Energy;Logic gates;Servers;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Access control;Computer crime;Internet of Things;Network security},   doi={10.1109/IoTDI.2018.00021},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to the battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, and the susceptibility of devices to cyber and physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and the information dissemination in the presence of adversaries. This work aims to build the theoretical foundations of designing secure and reconfigurable IoBT networks. Leveraging the theories of stochastic geometry and mathematical epidemiology, we develop an integrated framework to study the communication of mission-critical data among different types of network devices and consequently design the network in a cost effective manner.},   keywords={decision making;information dissemination;Internet of Things;military communication;telecommunication security;critical information dissemination;Internet of battlefield things;combat efficiency;coordinated decision-making;war scenarios;mission-critical data;Geometry;Computational modeling;Ad hoc networks;Wireless networks;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Sensors;Battlefield;epidemics;internet of things;Poisson point process},   doi={10.23919/WIOPT.2017.7959892},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Integration is often static and limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute- and storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart devices, like smart TVs or smart phones.

  year={2017},   volume={1},   number={3},   pages={224-234},   abstract={Due to its abilities to capture real-time data concerning the physical world, the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon is fast gaining momentum in different applicative domains. Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},   keywords={Big Data;cognitive systems;fault tolerant computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;model-driven methodology;autonomic cognitive IoT-based systems;health care;Internet of Things;autonomic cognitive design patterns;smart IoT-based systems;Big Data;scalability management;system functional requirements;system nonfunctional requirements;cognitive monitoring system;patient health management;heterogeneous wearable devices;heterogeneous large-scale data stream integration;heterogeneous large-scale data stream processing;system performance evaluation;response time;Scalability;Monitoring;Big Data;Complexity theory;Complex systems;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Autonomic computing;big data;cognitive computing;design patterns;IoT-based system},   doi={10.1109/TETCI.2017.2699218},   ISSN={2471-285X},   month={June},}

 title={A Novel Grading Biomarker for the Prediction of Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease}, 
  year={2017},   volume={64},   number={1},   pages={155-165},   abstract={Objective: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not only crucial in clinical practice, but also has a significant potential to enrich clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;diseases;feature selection;image registration;medical image processing;ADNI dataset;Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative;sparse representation technique;feature selection;age correction;image registration accuracy;magnetic resonance images;mild cognitive impairment;grading biomarker;Aging;Pathology;Biomedical imaging;Alzheimer's disease;Biomedical measurement;Magnetic resonance imaging;Alzheimer's disease (AD);biomarker;machine learning;prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion;structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging;Aged;Aging;Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Biomarkers;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Disease Progression;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique},   doi={10.1109/TBME.2016.2549363},   ISSN={0018-9294},   month={Jan},}

Continuous and discrete variables of different machines are monitored to analyze performance using a virtual environment running synchronous to plant floor equipment as a reference. Data are extracted from machines using industrial Internet of Things solutions. Productivity and reliability of a physical system are compared in real time with data from a hybrid simulation. The simulation uses discrete-event systems to estimate performance metrics at a system level, and continuous dynamics at a machine level to monitor input and output variables. Simulation outputs are used as a reference to detect abnormal conditions based on deviations of real outputs in different stages of the process. This monitoring method is implemented in a fully automated manufacturing system testbed with robots and CNC machines. Machines are integrated on an Ethernet/IP control network using a programmable logic controller to coordinate actions and transfer data. Results demonstrated the capacity to perform real-time monitoring and capture performance errors within confidence intervals.<italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>—Estimating expected performance of a manufacturing system processing different parts across multiple machines is a complex problem due to the lack of closed-form equations. Existing solutions focus on monitoring stochastic variables such as production or failure rate, or machine dynamics in separate environments often running asynchronous to the real system. This paper addresses the problem of monitoring and assessing the performance of complex manufacturing systems in real time. The proposed framework uses a real-time hybrid simulation of manufacturing at a machine and system level. The hybrid approach is based on a discrete and continuous model of manufacturing equipment integrated to run synchronously with the real plant floor operation. Data from both the virtual and real environments are merged to assess performance. Deviations from expected values represent an error that can trigger a warning signal to production, maintenance, and/or manufacturing personnel at the plant regarding health and productivity of plant operations.},   keywords={Real-time systems;Manufacturing systems;Monitoring;Virtual environments;Internet of Things;Productivity;Cyber-physical systems;discrete-event systems (DES);manufacturing automation and control;real-time hybrid simulation},   doi={10.1109/TASE.2017.2784826},   ISSN={1545-5955},   month={Oct},}

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

Specifically, wearable technology and robotics can enable a user to collect the required human signals in a comfortable way. HealthIoT is the basic infrastructure for realizing health surveillance, and should be flexible to support multiple application demands and facilitate the management of infrastructure. Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={871-876},   abstract={Lifelogging physical activity (PA) assessment is crucial to healthcare technologies and studies for the purpose of treatments and interventions of chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies.

The rapid development of IoT and vast expansion of wireless technologies unfold the new chances of growth in several domains such as, Education, Transportation, Agriculture, and especially in the Healthcare sector. Introducing the IoT through healthcare applications fetch several benefits, including cost savings through lowered hospital visiting costs, health care provider costs, transportation costs, human resource costs and the insurance costs. It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-2},   abstract={According to a study done in 2014 by National Health Interview Survey around 6.3 million children in United States suffer from asthma [1]. Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using an inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.},   keywords={diseases;electronic health records;Internet of Things;mobile computing;paediatrics;patient monitoring;electronic medical records;vulnerability score;asthma control level;multimodal data processing;kHealth framework;continuous patient monitoring;children;asthma management;smart health application;EMR;multimodal IoT;Pediatrics;Air quality;Temperature measurement;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Humidity},   doi={10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947025},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network.

The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment.

The accelerometer-based gait recognition is considered as an emerging and fast-evolving technology in security and access control fields and has achieved outstanding performance at certain fixed walking speeds. However, the gait recognition performance of the above technology deteriorates dramatically when the walking speed varies. To address this issue, both the speed-adaptive gait cycle segmentation method and individualized matching threshold generation method were proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the contrast experiments were conducted on the ZJU-GaitAcc public dataset sampled from five different body locations and the self-collected dataset sampled at various walking speeds. The experimental results indicated the average gait recognition and user authentication rates of 96.9% and 91.75%, respectively.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Prognostics, or predictive diagnostics, offers substantial promise to reduce the life-cycle costs of critical systems. When linked with comprehensive Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) or Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) architectures, prognostics offers significant benefits. Applications range from aerospace to industrial machines on the factory floor. These systems include electronic and mechanical components that are subject to wear-out and eventual failure. Standard test and diagnostics can serve to confirm the quality of the manufactured device or system at time zero but also can be used to monitor the health of the part throughout its lifetime. This is done by linking diagnostics with parameter extraction to determine on-going state-of-health (SoH). Algorithms can analyze the SoH to determine the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as well. Key benefits are that prognostics enable impending failures to be found before they occur, with improvements to safety and serviceability, along with life cycle cost reduction. On-line tests or periodic tests during the components'/systems' lifetime or burn-in tests and diagnosis serve to provide useful input data for the prognostic process. The historical basis for prognostics began with vibration monitoring of mechanical systems. It was found that unique signatures could be detected, extracted, and then correlated with wear on bearings or gears. These unique signatures, in turn, could be used to build fault dictionaries, to alert service personnel and trigger a host of autonomic logistical actions. In recent years, PHM has expanded to the electronics world, where users have raised concern about the robustness of systems when the key components such as ICs may have reduced lifetimes. While conventional mean-time-between-failures (MTBF)-type reliability estimates offer some initial measure of statistical lifetime, the individual system's lifetime is affected by its actual use environment, possible “Black Swan” events, or damage while in service. The basic process of prognostics involves an orderly sequence of steps ; - Sensing and observability : - Anomaly Detection : - Cross reference against a fault dictionary : - Algorithmic processing of data : - State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) calculations. As with any process or method, the business case has to be examined involving Return on Investment (ROI). Often the ROI calculations transcend organizational boundaries. Some of the early findings have been very encouraging on life-cycle cost reductions. The advent of advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has also introduced promising avenues for further growth in this area. Additional future trends involve the development of key standards for interoperability and tool development. The current state of prognostics, PHM/IVHM, Condition-based Maintenance and new areas of R&amp;D will be discussed, and their future impact on society.},   keywords={condition monitoring;gears;health and safety;machine bearings;reliability;testing;wear;prognostics and health management;complex systems;integrated vehicle health management architectures;parameter extraction;on-going state-of-health;remaining useful life;life cycle cost reduction;on-line tests;periodic tests;vibration monitoring;mechanical systems;wear;bearings;gears;autonomic logistical actions;mean-time-between-failures-type reliability;Prognostics and health management;Standards;Monitoring;Dictionaries;Europe;Vehicles;Aerospace industry},   doi={10.1109/ETS.2015.7138726},   ISSN={1530-1877},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Recently, an accelerating number of studies are dedicated to deploying various IoT applications in the information centric network paradigm which has lower system complexity than traditional network architectures. However, such a paradigm poses a number of security challenges especially when it is applied in real-time e-health applications. Firstly, it is difficult to ensure security of sensitive data in such a distributed data caching environment because after the data is published in the form of a packet to the information centric network (ICN), it is no longer controlled by the data publisher. Secondly, in some real-time e-health applications, terminal medical sensors are usually resource-constrained, limiting the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. In order to address these challenges, a resource-efficient secure data sharing scheme in information centric e-health system is proposed, one that utilizes ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and adapts it to the above-mentioned system with respect to necessary security requirements. It also exploits computation resources of fog nodes and employs outsourcing cryptography to improve system efficiency.The evaluation demonstrates that the scheme can significantly reduce the computation overheads of the resource-constrained terminal medical devices, and can better support the real-time e-health applications.},   keywords={cache storage;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;outsourcing;resource-efficient secure data;information centric e-health system;fog computing;accelerating number;IoT applications;information centric network paradigm;lower system complexity;security challenges;real-time e-health applications;sensitive data;distributed data caching environment;data publisher;above-mentioned system;computation resources;system efficiency;resource-constrained terminal medical devices;network architectures;security requirements;Encryption;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Edge computing;Publish-subscribe},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422844},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters. Through dissemination of the concept at this early phase of development in establishing the resource, an open invitation for peers and related interested parties to critique, advise, and otherwise contribute toward optimal development and wide impact is offered.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;Internet of Things resource;SoundScapes;health care intervention;health care communication;ICT use;information and communication technology;treatment outcomes;patient rehabilitation;evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource;feed-in feed-out entity;in-action model;on-action model;Games;Medical services;Cloud computing;Context;Technological innovation;Training;cloud-based collaboration resource;communication;Internet of Things;therapy;rehabilitation;healthcare},   doi={10.1109/CTS.2014.6867605},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

To exploit this opportunity, an ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should aim for a cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform-based in-home healthcare station is proposed.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Flanged valves are ubiquitous in oil and gas pipeline networks. The valves help to both connect pipes together and control the flow of fluids. Depending on the location, the valve may experience high temperatures, high pressures, and corrosive agents, all of which degrade the integrity of the flange connection. Thus, flanged valves require regular inspection and maintenance. However, in cases where the valve is located in inaccessible areas, regular inspection can be difficult and costly. While certain methods are currently available for automatic inspection of flanged valves, they often suffer from impracticality issues, such as intrusiveness, unintuitive operation, or sensor fragility. Therefore, this paper introduces a sensing device that, as inspired by wearable technology (WT), can be easily and non-invasively &amp;#x201C;worn&amp;#x201D; onto the flanged valve and performs measurements in real-time. The device is composed of piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers fortified by a layer of cushioning rubber and a metallic outer layer. This paper presents the design of the device, and verifies its performance using a 12-bolted flanged valve recovered from the field. The device is able to accurately track the tightness of the bolted connections. Unlike prior PZT-based monitoring methods, this device shows great promise for practical application.},   keywords={Fasteners;Monitoring;Valves;Biomedical monitoring;Transducers;Oils;Metals;Wearable Technology;Structure Health Monitoring (SHM);Piezoelectric Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT);Wearable Sensor Device;Impedance method.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2852653},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study.

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={11413-11422},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technological paradigm that can connect things from various fields through the Internet. For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.},   keywords={Bluetooth;body area networks;computerised monitoring;energy harvesting;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;patient monitoring;wireless sensor networks;continuous medical monitoring;output-based maximum power point tracking technique;flexible solar energy harvester;Web-based smartphone application;autonomous WBAN;Bluetooth low energy transmission;solar energy harvesting;wearable sensor node;IoT connected healthcare applications;Internet of Things;autonomous wireless body area network;time 24 h;Wearable sensors;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Solar panels;Solar energy;Maximum power point trackers;Temperature measurement;Internet of Things;wireless body area network;energy harvesting;maximum power point tracking;Bluetooth},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2716344},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Design-To-Cost (DTC) is an effective technique for this situation. In Model-Based Design (MBD), DTC cost estimates are preferred to be generated from models as one of the parameters to optimize the design. However, most cost modeling methods focus in estimation on costs associated with new product development, and much fewer discuss the estimate of the switching costs for new products that are designed leveraging previous products. In this paper, we explore certain available tools for DTC for such purposes and discuss their advantages/disadvantages. We performed an experimental study on a building PHM (Prognostic and Health Monitoring) sensing system design example, and demonstrated an approach to achieve switching cost estimation using parametric modeling by treating part of the new product as another prior product. Finally, a multi-objective optimization is used for design selection, to achieve the best trade-off between cost and performance.},   keywords={condition monitoring;costing;Internet of Things;optimisation;product development;production engineering computing;IoT;system design;material selections;massive production;Design-To-Cost;DTC cost estimates;product development;switching costs;switching cost estimation;multiobjective optimization;design selection;parametric modeling tools;cost modeling methods;Internet of Things;Tools;Switches;Estimation;Hardware;Software;Sensors;Buildings},   doi={10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088305},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

The problem of migraine, a debilitating headache which usually causes chronic neurological disorders for for patients, is one such area where both of these technologies can prove to be highly useful and help us gain insights into the causes and prevention of the problem. Prevention of migraine can only come from ubiquitous and autonomous observation and correlation of triggers and environmental parameters peculiar to a patient. However, such observations need to be aggregated without actively engaging the patient thorough questionnaires, because patients are historically reluctant to answer questions in real time, often develop false recollections, and give inaccurate answers. The advent of personal IoT smart devices makes it possible to autonomously collect trigger and environmental data, and find correlation between different factors and migraine attacks in real time so that an accurate prediction of an impending migraine attack can be made, and steps can be taken to prevent such attacks.

These are biggest service industries that affect whole world population and give jobs to millions of people. Recently we witness major changes in both industries, as more services are transferred to small providers, including individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={132-137},   abstract={The rapid advances in modern wireless technology opens the door for new applications using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In the medical field, staff members of a certain hospital are in need for a system that tracks where patients/medical staff/devices are at any given time. LoCATE, which is Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment, provides a near-real time tracking tool for medical systems using the existing 802.11 WiFi infrastructure. The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara<sup>®</sup>RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions. While implications for an IoT system such as LoCATE are wide-ranging; its primary objective is to provide an easy to use, low-cost solution to track the location of medical assets in real-time.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;radiofrequency identification;Web services;wireless LAN;Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment;wireless technology;Internet of Things;IoT technology;near-real time tracking tool;medical system;WiFi infrastructure;Sentara RMH hospital;real-time location data;cloud computing platform;Amazon Web Services;mobile app;cloud storage platform;health care system;LoCATE system;radiofrequency identification;RFID technology;patient health data;disease;medical asset location;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Wireless fidelity;Transmitters;Hospitals;Cloud Computing;E-Health Care;Internet of Things (IoT);Localization},   doi={10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937703},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={10744-10756},   abstract={A reliable wireless sensor network (WSN) is defined as a network that functions satisfactorily, in terms of both its coverage and connectivity to the sink(s), throughout its intended mission time. Deploying reliable WSNs is especially important for critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as industrial, structural health-monitoring, and military applications. In such applications, failure of the WSN to carry out its required tasks can have serious effects, and hence, cannot be tolerated. However, the deployment of reliable WSNs is a challenging problem. This is primarily attributed to the fact that sensor nodes are subject to random failures due to different factors, such as hardware failures, battery depletion, harsh environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, the problem of deploying a WSN with a specified minimum level of reliability at a minimum deployment cost is addressed. This problem is coined the minimum cost reliability constrained sensor node deployment problem (MCRC-SDP). The MCRC-SDP is proved to be an NP-Complete. An ant colony optimization algorithm coupled with a local search heuristic is proposed as a solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding high-quality solutions to the problem.},   keywords={ant colony optimisation;computational complexity;Internet of Things;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks;local search heuristic;NP-complete;MCRC-SDP;minimum cost reliability constrained sensor node deployment problem;harsh environmental conditions;battery depletion;hardware failures;structural health-monitoring;IoT applications;Internet of Things;WSN;reliable wireless sensor network deployment;ant colony optimization approach;Wireless sensor networks;Measurement;Optimization;Monitoring;Ant colony optimization;Reliability engineering;Wireless sensor networks;sensor node deployment;network reliability;ant colony optimization;greedy heuristic;local search},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2711484},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

A specific health care application is to ascertain patients' activity of daily living while at home using accelerometer data from non-invasive wearables. It is often necessary to store this data on the device to be retrieved later for analysis. However, the devices typically store far more data than can be transmitted with commonly used low power radios. To mitigate the problem, this paper proposes an energy efficient, lossless compression algorithm that uses an offline frequency distribution to create a symbol-code lookup table. Using an extensive set of data from a previous study, an analysis of the entropy of activities of daily living accelerometer data is presented. The compression algorithm is compared against this estimated entropy. Energy being critical for IoT devices, the trade-off between energy cost for compression versus energy saved during transmission is also analysed.},   keywords={accelerometers;data compression;entropy;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;table lookup;noninvasive wearables;symbol-code lookup table;IoT devices;energy analysis;Internet of Things;numerous future applications;frequency distribution;health care application;computational resourses;patients activity;power radios;energy efficiency;entropy analysis;energy transmission;accelerometer lossless compression algorithm;Entropy;Accelerometers;Conferences;Medical services;Compression algorithms;Biomedical monitoring;Dictionaries},   doi={10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8368985},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Seven participants were observed watching their favorite TV programs. Then each participant was asked to rate some of their own activities according to two situations: attentive to the TV program (Level 1) or not (Level 2). Attention levels were classified using a Deep Neural Network algorithm (DNN) after extracting a set of descriptors from the sensors' data of the three devices and fused them. The results show that the levels of attention were classified with an accuracy of 88.44% and 87.89% for the level 1 and level 2 respectively.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={523-530},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an ubiquitous concept where physical objects are connected over the internet and are provided with unique identifiers to enable their self-identification to other devices and the ability to transmit data over the network. Sensor nodes along with their heterogeneous nature are the main part of the IoT and may act as internet hosts or clients. Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication.

Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide hap tic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems.

Nowadays, smartphones are ubiquitous and widely used around the world, in which rich sensors are embedded. Thus, a smartphone based falling detection system, SmartFDS is proposed in this paper, which can recognize the associated individual's falling behavior and send out an emergent message containing the location for immediate help. Generally, SmartFDS includes offline training phase and online activity recognition phase. Specifically, in training phase, utilizing the embedded accelerometer sensor, falling data for various situations are collected to extract the desired features that can appropriately characterize the falling behavior. Considering that the raw data are intrinsically prone to noise and error, those data are preprocessed by weighted smoothing. Then, 6 time-domain features are elaborated to determine the discriminative features for characterizing falling, and two features, maximum and vertical velocity are selected. Then, 4 different classification algorithms are investigated, and SVM is selected.

This technology involves sensing, communication, and processing of real time data received from billions of connected devices with minimal human intervention. The exposure to the Internet and constraints in IoT devices, typically limited memory, low processing ability, and mostly battery based operations make them vulnerable to various attacks. These attacks include but are not limited to Denial of Service (DOS), Man-in-Middle(MIM), Sybil and flooding attacks. Security becomes vital in IoT applications as they are expected to interact with the physical world, especially in safety critical applications like health, defense, automobiles etc. The traditional security model for Internet applications is not suitable for IoT, as it is mostly non-realtime and non-safety critical. Further, end-nodes are not considered to be energy-constrained devices in this model. Therefore, it is important to have alternative solutions that provide meaningful security to IoT devices/applications. In this paper we propose a novel secure communication and firewall architecture suitable for IoT applications. It is based on the idea of off-loading computational load from IoT devices by introducing a server entity in the network. Further, we also discuss design of protocol, entity states and other implementation details.

There have been distinctive health challenges focused in the society through technical innovations. Most of the elderly people today experiences loneliness and psychological depressions, either as a result of living alone/ abandonment or due to reduced connection with their children and relatives. To enhance the quality of services in the elderly healthcare system we have developed a ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based (Internet of Things) Help to You (H2U) healthcare system to integrate various technologies of wearable devices, biosensors and wireless sensor networks in order to provide an intensive service management platform. This method would support the real time activity and monitor the healthcare system for the elderly citizens. In this method the information collected by various wearable devices in real time are stored in the central database which thereby connects people, doctors, and practitioner at the time of an emergency for the right information. This way the system could increase accessibility, efficiency, and also lower the health expenses to improve the comfort and safety as well as management of daily routines of an elderly life.},   keywords={biosensors;database management systems;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;psychology;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks;intuitive IoT-based H2U healthcare system;elderly people;elderly citizens;technical innovations;loneliness;psychological depressions;quality of services;elderly healthcare system;ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based help to you healthcare system;Internet of Things;wearable devices;biosensors;wireless sensor networks;intensive service management platform;central database;health expenses;elderly life;Senior citizens;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Sensors;Diseases;Internet;IoT;H2U;healthcare systems;sensors;wearable devices;emergency},   doi={10.1109/ICNSC.2016.7479018},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The flight location can be tracked by commercial tracker equipped with existing technology such as satellite-based tracking, cellular phone tracking, APRS system and using Ultra High-Frequency narrow band FM transmitter. These tracking methods are expensive and not interactive in real time to the end user. Sometimes, the balloon get disappears due to natural disaster or communication errors. In order to increase the efficiency and to replace the traditional tracking methods in low altitudes flight tracking, this paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) based GPS tracking solution for low altitude balloon in real-time. This implementation used Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) Network by deploying Low Power Long Rang (LoRa) technology and cellular IoT combined with live video transmission. These integrated protocol yields ultimate results in real time monitoring, lowering the cost of preparation, it could reduce the losing rate of balloon's payload and also helps the end user to store the data in real time flight operation.

Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and accessed by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while preventing unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system that supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},   keywords={authorisation;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;medical file;timely access;emergency medical care;healthcare IoT network;lightweight break-glass access control system;patient care;medical devices;healthcare IoT measure patients;healthcare workers;unauthorized access;patient files;emergency situations;medical worker;access policy;emergent situations;break-glass access mechanism;healthcare Internet-of-Things;Access control;Medical services;Cryptography;Biomedical imaging;Informatics;Hip;Cloud computing;Access control;break-glass;healthcare system;lightweight;secure Internet-of-Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2017.2751640},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Aug},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={863-868},   abstract={To alleviate the air pollution problem caused by vehicle emissions, different vehicle inspection programs have been introduced, in which vehicles are examined by undergoing a number of emission tests. However, these emission tests are usually cost-ineffective and time-consuming. It is also difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new vehicle emission inspection and notification system to help daily monitoring of engine health through the concept of Internet of Things. As there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area, they are employed to play an important role in the proposed system. By the fact that every car must stop in front of red lights, reliable reading of air ratio (λ) from a vehicle, which indicates the engine emission status, can be interrogated wirelessly through mature and low-price radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. By inspecting the λ in real time, the vehicle emissions can be effectively controlled by the governmental authorities. Meanwhile, several implementation issues have also been considered and analyzed in this paper. An innovative method is proposed to select the appropriate traffic lights on which RFID monitoring devices should be installed.},   keywords={air pollution control;air pollution measurement;condition monitoring;internal combustion engines;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;road vehicles;RFID monitoring devices;RFID technology;radio frequency identification technology;engine emission status;engine health monitoring;vehicle emission notification system;air pollution problem;traffic lights;Internet of Things;vehicle emission control;vehicle emission inspection;Vehicles;Radiofrequency identification;Inspection;Roads;Engines;Servers;Information systems;Internet of Things;radio frequency identification;vehicle emissions inspection;emission control;maximum spanning trees component},   doi={10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799917},   ISSN={2378-1289},   month={Dec},}

This growth in physical deployments and physical devices fuelled the development of cloud middleware for managing a large number of sensor data streams generated by the individual sensors. In this paper, we describe one such computational middleware, called IoT-Framework, built on open source components. The main objective of this framework is to disseminate the generated raw data streams as well as processed and fused streams to multiple interested parties.

We propose a new approach to shared key derivation for Body Area Networks (BANs). Body area networks are quickly becoming increasingly important in the world of healthcare with wide application in the treatment and monitoring of chronic patients using on-body devices. Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys. We show that these measurements results in derived keys that are unpredictable and exhibit significant difference with previous keys. This is an improvement over existing schemes where keys vary for different hosts but tend to be similar over time.},   keywords={ad hoc networks;body area networks;body sensor networks;cryptography;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;motion measurement;patient monitoring;patient treatment;telecommunication security;telemedicine;wearable security;body area sensor network;host movement;Internet-of-Things;ad-hoc connections;security parameter negotiation;shared key derivation;BAN;healthcare;chronic patient treatment;chronic patient monitoring;on-body devices;response time;emergency situation;patient complication detection;motion sensors;physiological signals;physical access;electrocardiograms;ECG;secure communication;device communication;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Monitoring;Body area networks;Frequency measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Authentication;Key Derivation;Physiology;Internet-of-Things;User-Centric;Security},   doi={10.1109/ISIE.2016.7745050},   ISSN={2163-5145},   month={June},}

  year={2012},   volume={},   number={},   pages={745-750},   abstract={Embedded intelligence entails a vision of the Internet of Things oriented to "Ambient Intelligence", which can be defined as the capacity to collect and analyze the digital traces left by people when they interact with the environment and with such "intelligent things". In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},   keywords={data structures;ecology;embedded systems;emergency services;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;health hazards anticipation;ontology-based IoT domotic environment;embedded intelligence;Internet of Things;ambient intelligence;digital traces;intelligent things;human behavior;everyday life;automated home;Internet-capable things;semantic knowledge representation;semantic Web;distributed environmental context information;natural abstraction;interoperability;technology-independent manner;domestic environment;computational significance;intelligent ecosystem;machine learning;artificial intelligence techniques;occupants behaviors;e-health system;emergency situations;Ontologies;Semantics;Ambient intelligence;Context;Senior citizens;Monitoring;Ambient Intelligent;domotics;home automation;DomoNet;SOA;XML;Ontology;Machine Learning;E-Health},   doi={10.1109/IMIS.2012.109},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

The collection, storage, and retrival of data are the key components of wearable sensors. Therefore, it&amp;#x2019;s important to optimize data storage and retrieval. PRAM is a kind of phase change memory that is widely used as a new storage medium. It has the characteristics of non-volatility, high-density storage. However, it has the disadvantages of asymmetry in reading and writing and limited life. In recent years, PRAM and DRAM were combined into PDRAM as a hybrid memory architecture, to solve the problems caused by PRAM. This study proposes a new cache policy named Hybrid-LRU to adapt PDRAM. Hybrid-LRU uses two different LRU cache policies to distinguish PRAM and DRAM as two different storage mediums. The experimental results show that the Hybrid-LRU cache policy improves the performance by 4.2%, and reduces the utilization rate of PRAM in PDRAM by 11.8%. In addition, the energy consumption of writing and reading can be reduced to 87.8%.},   keywords={Phase change random access memory;Writing;Internet of Things;Memory architecture;Wearable sensors;Energy consumption;phase change memory;hybrid memory architecture;cache policy;LRU.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2834533},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

But, Return Oriented Programming (ROP) has the capability to break this security cover and take control over the IoT device. In this paper we present an effective implementation of the ROP, used as a defensive weapon against code tampering by adversaries. We also propose techniques to choose the best gadget set for building the ROP chain.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;operating systems (computers);tamper-resistant code;optimal ROP gadgets;IoT devices;revolutionary applications;massive deployment;severe security concerns;running operating systems;modern operating systems;attack prevention techniques;no-execute memory page protection;NX memory page protection;malicious code;return oriented programming;defensive weapon;code tampering;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Logic gates;Operating systems;Servers;Biological cells;Internet of Things;ROP;Gadget;Genetic Algorithm},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986348},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

Based on the traditional dictionary learning methods, which neglects the relationship between the sample and the dictionary atom, we propose the weighted mechanism to connect the sample with the dictionary atom in this paper. Meanwhile, the traditional dictionary learning method is prone to cause over-fitting for patient classification of the limited training data set. Therefore, this paper adopts l<sub>2</sub>-norm regularization constraint, which realizes the limitation of the model space, and enhances the generalization ability of the model and avoids over-fitting to some extent. Compared with the previous shallow dictionary learning, this paper proposed the greedy deep dictionary learning. We adopt the thinking of layer by layer training to increase the hidden layer, so that the local information between the layer and the layer can be trained to maintain their own characteristics, reduce the risk of overfitting and make sure that each layer of the network is convergent, which improves the accuracy of training and learning. With the development of Internet of Things and the soundness of healthcare monitoring system, the method proposed have better reliability in the field of mobile multimedia for healthcare. The results show that the learning method has a good effect on the classification of mobile multimedia for medical diseases, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classification have good performance, which may provide guidance for the diagnosis of disease in wisdom medical.},   keywords={diseases;greedy algorithms;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;mobile computing;multimedia systems;pattern classification;greedy deep learning method;medical disease analysis;greedy deep weighted dictionary;mobile multimedia;medical diseases analysis;traditional dictionary learning method;dictionary atom;greedy deep dictionary learning;shallow dictionary learning;patient classification;l2-norm regularization constraint;Internet of Things;healthcare;disease diagnosis;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Big Data;Medical services;Dictionaries;Training;Medical big data;machine learning;mobile multimedia;deep learning;dictionary learning;patient classification},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823979},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of leveraging recommendation algorithms, especially graph-based, to IoT. We propose a hyper-graph model for IoT systems in which each hyper-edge connects users, objects, and services. Next, we conduct experiment to analyze and explore correlations between performances of different algorithms on IoT Service Recommendation (IoTSRS) based on existing well known metrics.

Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Internet of Things is an internetwork where people interact with the environment via sensors and machines to perform physical activities remotely. IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely via internet such as changing the room temperature by controlling an air conditioner, switching on the lights in your apartment, using smart watches to gather information about your body health (blood pressure and heart beat rate) and sends it to your private doctor to monitor it and so on. Performing a research on issues faced with IoT, it was realized that most challenges were of privacy/confidentiality and data integrity. This project further conducts research on finding ways of securing information that is shared between two or more interactive IoT devices. The main objective of the project was to develop a strategy of securing the IoT technology world. The method that was proposed to provide data security and integrity was through cryptographic methods/security algorithms that require decent memory and equitable CPU processing power. There were three security methods that were focused on in this project i.e. RSA, AES and TDES algorithms. Each of the encryption/decryption methods were presented with their detailed design and functionality. The most suitable and better performing security algorithm for IoT technology was chosen according to the measures of time, memory and processing power. With the tests performed on the proposed security algorithms, AES encryption standard seemed to perform better than other security algorithms in terms computational time, memory consumption and the required processing power. The test results also showed that it has a large encryption/decryption key size which also means better protection for data. However, through testing of the encryption methods there were shortcomings that were encountered such as inability of the security algorithms to provide authentication and encrypt different data formats such as video, picture and audio. The short comings will be further dealt with on the future work. The success of this research has potential impact on increasing the security of IoT internetwork which intern will increase the number of users in the IoT world.},   keywords={computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;Internet of Things;internetworking;interactive IoT devices;IoT technology world;data security;equitable CPU processing power;security methods;AES encryption standard;encryption methods;IoT internetwork;IoT world;data integrity;data formats;security algorithms;cryptographic methods;encryption-decryption methods;encryption-decryption key size;Algorithm design and analysis;Encryption;Ciphers;Standards;Public key;IoT;RSA;AES;TDES;cryptography;security algorithms},   doi={10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102332},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

 title={Experimental sleep phases monitoring}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={625-628},   abstract={Nowadays there is a rich diversity of sleep monitoring systems available on the market. They promise to offer information about sleep quality of the user by recording a limited number of vital signals, mainly heart rate and body movement. Typically, fitness trackers, smart watches, smart shirts, smartphone applications or patches do not provide access to the raw sensor data. Moreover, the sleep classification algorithm and the agreement ratio with the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG) are not disclosed. Some commercial systems record and store the data on the wearable device, but the user needs to transfer and import it into specialised software applications or return it to the doctor, for clinical evaluation of the data set. Thus an immediate feedback mechanism or the possibility of remote control and supervision are lacking. Furthermore, many such systems only distinguish between sleep and wake states, or between wake, light sleep and deep sleep. It is not always clear how these stages are mapped to the four known sleep stages: REM, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3-4. [1] The goal of this research is to find a reduced complexity method to process a minimum number of bio vital signals, while providing accurate sleep classification results. The model we propose offers remote control and real time supervision capabilities, by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This paper focuses on the data processing method and the sleep classification logic. The body sensor network representing our data acquisition system will be described in a separate publication.

The problem of overprivilege stands out due to the diversity and complexity of IoT apps, and developers rushing to release apps to meet the high demand in the IoT market. Any incorrect API usage of the IoT frameworks by third-party developers can lead to security risks, especially in health and fitness apps. Protecting sensitive user information is critically important to prevent financial and psychological harms. This paper presents PGFIT, a static permission analysis tool that precisely and efficiently identifies overprivilege issues in third-party apps built on top of a popular IoT programming framework, Google Fit. PGFIT extracts the set of requested permission scopes and the set of used data types in Google Fitenabled apps to determine whether the requested permission scopes are actually necessary. In this way, PGFIT serves as a quality assurance tool for developers and a privacy checker for app users. We used PGFIT to perform overprivilege analysis on a set of 20 Google Fit-enabled apps and with manual inspection, we found that 6 (30%) of them are overprivileged.},   keywords={authorisation;data privacy;Internet of Things;mobile computing;risk management;IoT programming frameworks;third-party developers;user data;data sources;IoT apps;IoT market;IoT frameworks;protecting sensitive user information;PGFIT;static permission analysis tool;third-party apps;requested permission scopes;used data types;Google Fit-enabled apps;Google;Programming;Sensors;Authorization;Androids;Humanoid robots;Tools;IoT-Programming-Frameworks;Permissions;Least-Privilege;Static-Program-Analysis},   doi={10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00081},   ISSN={2324-9013},   month={Aug},}

One of the things that has a lot of potential is the lighting equipment since it is widely used in our daily life. Recently, the technology of visible light communication (VLC) has been widely discussed. VLC has several advantages, such as freedom of license, line-of-sight security, and less health concern compared with radio-based systems. In addition, the rapid progress of light emitting diode (LED) technology by solid-state lighting allows VLC to be easily deployed and integrated with the existing lighting infrastructure at low costs. However, VLC, when integrated with lighting infrastructure, is usually for one-way communication and is highly sensitive to external interfering light. Thus, transmitting or broadcasting multiple messages simultaneously over a visible light channel without any preprocessing may result in serious collisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle these problems by optical code division multiple access (CDMA) for VLC. With our approach, a VLC receiver can enter an environment without any prior configuration and can be designed with simple hardware. Even a mobile device with a high-resolution photodiode sensor can be used as a receiver. We demonstrate an application of indoor positioning by querying the location service provider on the Internet with the IDs decoded from the received light signals. The prototyping results reveal some communication properties of CDMA-based VLC and its potential for indoor positioning applications.},   keywords={broadcast communication;code division multiple access;indoor navigation;LED lamps;lighting;mobile communication;optical links;simultaneous message broadcasting;CDMA based visible light communications;light emitting diode;solid state lighting;lighting infrastructure;optical code division multiple access;mobile device;high resolution photodiode sensor;indoor positioning application;Lighting;Multiaccess communication;Receivers;Broadcasting;Optical sensors;Optical transmitters;Brightness;broadcast;CDMA;IEEE 802.15.7;localization;pervasive computing;visible light communication;Broadcast;CDMA;IEEE 802.15.7;localization;pervasive computing;visible light communication},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2015.2463684},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={Dec},}

 title={Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers}, 
  year={2017},   volume={60},   number={1},   pages={4-23},   abstract={Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns.

With smart sensing and remote monitoring, peoples' health conditions can be assessed more effectively but to provide IoT services such as depressive disorder assistance still, there are many challenges to overcome. A huge number of connected heterogeneous devices and enormous amounts of data generated by these devices are not only difficult to manage but providing services with them in a dynamic IoT environment, count for significant efforts. There is a requirement for mechanisms that not only cater the heterogeneity of IoT devices but also provide dynamic services efficiently based on user requirements. Web of Objects (WoO) platform enables IoT services by virtualizing real world objects using semantic ontology. It provides a base for the development of interoperable microservices which support dynamic features by utilizing streams of sensory data.

Based on the results we show that the 16-bit split-radix butterfly hardware architecture is more power-efficient than 16-bit radix-4 one. Moreover, we are able to improve the power-efficiency of the split-radix butterfly by using efficient 5-2 adder compressors.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Various global development opportunities have been escalated through the Internet of Everything (IoE) with the potential of progressing Sustainable Development goals - dramatically accelerating and improving lives of millions. The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people. The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The successful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures.

Sensors' performance will deteriorate with the remaining energy level and dead sensor nodes will affect the performance of an entire network, especially in multi-hop networks.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={165-176},   abstract={An increasing number of sensors on mobile, Internet of things (IoT), and wearable devices generate time-series measurements of physical activities. Though access to the sensory data is critical to the success of many beneficial applications such as health monitoring or activity recognition, a wide range of potentially sensitive information about the individuals can also be discovered through access to sensory data and this cannot easily be protected using traditional privacy approaches. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving sensing framework for managing access to time-series data in order to provide utility while protecting individuals' privacy. We introduce Replacement AutoEncoder, a novel feature-learning algorithm which learns how to transform discriminative features of multi-variate time-series that correspond to sensitive inferences, into some features that have been more observed in non-sensitive inferences, to protect users' privacy. This efficiency is achieved by defining a user-customized objective function for deep autoencoders. Replacement will not only eliminate the possibility of recognition sensitive inferences, it also eliminates the possibility of detecting the occurrence of them, that is the main weakness of other approaches such as filtering or randomization. We evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm with an activity recognition task in a multi-sensing environment using extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. We show that it can retain the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art techniques while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive information. Finally, we utilize the GANs for detecting the occurrence of replacement, after releasing data, and show that this can be done only if the adversarial network is trained on the users' original data.},   keywords={data analysis;data privacy;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);time series;Replacement AutoEncoder;privacy-preserving algorithm;sensory data analysis;mobile Internet;wearable devices;time-series measurements;physical activities;beneficial applications;potentially sensitive information;traditional privacy approaches;privacy-preserving sensing framework;time-series data;discriminative features;multivariate time-series;nonsensitive inferences;deep autoencoders;recognition sensitive inferences;activity recognition task;multisensing environment;feature-learning algorithm;Data privacy;Feature extraction;Sensors;Inference algorithms;Task analysis;Privacy;Privacy Protection;Feature Learning;Time Series Analysis;Wearable Sensors;Activity Recognition},   doi={10.1109/IoTDI.2018.00025},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The establishment of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provided several advances in the field of healthcare for older adults. However, the development of AAL platforms focused on older adults is still presenting several challenges. Many of these challenges are similar to those existing for IoT architectures (i.e., interoperability) and others are derived from the healthcare domain (e.g., patients and caregivers as end-users). In this paper, we present a survey of secondary studies on AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017. Our focus resided in investigating the state-of-the-art of the adaptive AAL platforms for older adults assistance. We have established a set of research questions with which we seek to gain an overview of AAL platforms, development patterns, and the main challenges in this domain. We describe our search protocol, the execution, the selection of the papers, and the results obtained. Among the conclusions of our overview, we can mention the absence of a reference architecture for AAL platforms and some open questions (e.g., data privacy, usability, accessibility) present in this domain.},   keywords={assisted living;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;older adults assistance;Ambient Assisted Living;elderly world population;healthcare domain;AAL platforms;IoT;Systematics;Protocols;Statistics;Internet of Things;Medical services;Senior citizens;AAL;Ambient Assisted Living;Systematic literature review;Population aging;AAL platform},   doi={10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428745},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The new devices give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context, where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability.

In this paper, we present a scheme where the QoS is calculated when the IoBNT is applied for sensing abnormalities in kidney. For this end the following key points are considered: (i) sensing of charged proteins through THz waves, (ii) reception by bio-cyber device and subsequent emission of MHz waves, (iii) reception by smartphone, (iv) reception and storing of information at the cloud, (v) exchanging information with server and world-wide-web, and (vi) final reception and treatment of data by the enduser. The estimation of the full QoS has paid attention to the atomic absorption of THz waves by water in human tissue, fact which might degrade the optimal surveillance of the sensing of proteins and which is translated as the main source of errors.

The recent growth of Internet of Things provides the opportunity to maintain this relationship in a more secure and efficient way. From this point of view, this paper presents a system of real-time nurse calling with focus centered on nurse feedback based on patient condition. The system also includes a robust archive monitoring system for review and trend analysis. In the proposed system, patients are able to call for assistance in time of emergency by pressing a designated button. After this, the device will send a real-time message containing information about the patients bed, room, and floor number to the appropriate nurse station. Nurse will respond as soon as the message is delivered, and optionally call for help by pressing designated buttons in the device. The proposed system reduces the delay in response of nurse. Additionally, the interactions are stored in Raspberry Pi database for future analysis to improve the quality of services. The proposed system uses low-cost hardware like ATMEGA328P microcontroller and ENC28J60 Ethernet controller, and Arduino Uno.},   keywords={local area networks;medical information systems;microcontrollers;patient care;user interfaces;nurse feedback;patient condition;robust archive monitoring system;designated button;real-time message;patients bed;Raspberry Pi database;real-time feedback-centric nurse calling system;real-time nurse calling;nurse station;Servers;Microcontrollers;Pins;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Hardware;Hospitals;Nurse Calling System;ENC28J60;ATMEGA328P;Raspberry Pi;Nurse Panel Unit},   doi={10.1109/NSYSS2.2017.8267799},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Having said that, 'image distribution' in medical field has always been a challenge for the reasons known. And one primary parameter which always questions the very aspect of distribution has been 'Data Security and Patient Privacy'.The advances in technology and BYOD(Bring Your Own Devices) nature in the IOT industry has changed the paradigm of healthcare industry. In today's connected world it becomes increasing imperative to address aspects like 'data security, threat and patient privacy' and the 'risk mitigation' strategy within our products and solutions we offer. 'Prevention is better than cure' and history is the witness that no legislation has succeeded in totally eliminating security breaches from the globe. The only possible step is to adopt tight security implementation mechanisms and effective risk control measures in parallel to enhancing the privacy policies to combat the security attacks.

The universal Internet connectivity of such smart objects has brought about a new era of ubiquitous application development for the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, security has become critically important. In the past decade, academia and industry have dedicated great efforts to the design of continuous authentication for multi-modal networks. Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training) data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply machinelearning- based techniques to derive a user's plantar bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's notice.},   keywords={biometrics (access control);health care;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);microcomputers;pressure sensors;ubiquitous computing;continuous user authentication;plantar biometrics;comprehensive evolution;information communication technologies;mobile sensing objects;versatile ubiquitous network services;intelligent wearable devices;universal Internet connectivity;smart objects;ubiquitous application development;Internet of Things;multimodal networks;multiform authentication bio-tokens;continuous entity identification;wearable healthcare;wearable plantar bio-feature extractor;user plantar bio-data;authentication system;authentication tokens;machine learning-based techniques;Raspberry PI platform;continuous entity verification;specific-purpose modern sensors;Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Electrocardiography;Support vector machines;Password;Biomedical monitoring},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700339},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={Feb},}

Current network monitoring approaches, particularly those that are agent-based, are proprietary, costly, and may not scale. This paper proposes a lightweight, scalable agentless system which can be configured, setup, and begin monitoring network health within minutes. The architecture utilizes a polling script to query Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) demon for metrics, Prometheus Time Series Database instances for storage, and a Grafana Dashboard for metric presentation and alerting. The system design removes the learning curve necessary for most open source monitoring systems, while still providing similar metrics. The approach demonstrated here shows the ease and security with which specific site network monitoring can be deployed in a cloud configuration. Data from the network monitoring can be forwarded to a central analysis site for assessment and correlation. The proposed system is scalable, extensible for use in most cloud hosting environments, and provides network managers with direct control over the monitoring process and dashboard.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer network security;Internet of Things;protocols;time series;scalable agentless cloud network monitoring;infrastructure as a service;cloud computing;Internet of Things;global infrastructure;cybersecurity;lightweight scalable agentless system;network health monitoring;simple network monitoring protocol;SNMP;Prometheus time series database instances;Grafana dashboard;metric presentation;metric alerting;learning curve;open source monitoring systems;central analysis site;cloud hosting environments;network managers;monitoring process;Monitoring;Measurement;Cloud computing;Protocols;Security;Servers;Databases;network monitoring;cloud computing;agentless;SNMP;network management;network security},   doi={10.1109/CSCloud.2017.11},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

While the functionalities it presents are appealing to both children and their parents, the privacy concerns that are raised should be taken into serious consideration. A big amount of personal data of the child (and probably of other uninformed minors and adults in physical vicinity) are processed and analysed, an accurate profile of the child is created and direct marketing practices would most probably take place. The toy could suddenly turn into a surveillance device, while malicious third parties might hack the device and proceed to activities that would even threaten the child's physical and/or mental health. Data minimisation and privacy enhancing technologies are suggested, that would, if not completely alleviate, at least diminish the risks presented. Cybersecurity measures constitute a necessary condition for the alleviation of privacy concerns.

The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Our initial numerical results show a reduction of the handoff costs on the mobile router which normally constitute a bottleneck in such a system. We also discuss important metrics such as signaling overload, bandwidth efficiency and power consumption and how they can be optimized through the mobility management.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;IP networks;low-power electronics;mobility management (mobile radio);patient monitoring;personal area networks;power consumption;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication signalling;transport protocols;wireless sensor networks;network mobility solution;NEMO-HWSN;IPv6 low-power personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;mobility support;large-scale IP-based sensor technology;hospital wireless network;6LoWPAN application;patient monitoring;patient vital signs;mobility management;patient nodes-hospital network connectivity;fault tolerance;energy consumption;IPv6 mobility protocols;hospital architecture;handoff cost reduction;mobile router;signaling overload;bandwidth efficiency;power consumption;wireless sensor network;health care;Hospitals;Mobile communication;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks;Internet;Monitoring;Mobile computing;6LoWPAN;NEMO Mobility;Healthcare;Wireless Sensor Networks;Hand-off},   doi={10.1109/IMIS.2013.157},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={E-health is one of the domains which will need more and more IoT solutions in the future, as it requires short delays for life-dependency situations and safe local storage spaces for privacy matters. The emergency context demands efficient communication and computing capacities, and the cloud vision as well as traditional TCP/IP way of communication cannot really suit these requirements. New approaches are currently used : the fog computing paradigm, which describe the IoT environment in a more relevant way than the cloud vision, provides new performances as low latency, local storage opportunities, end-to-user services. E-health fogs have attracted a lot of attentions. To realize the efficient communication, E-Health systems also introduce Content-Centric Network (CCN) approach, whose characteristics include quick response, content distribution, IoT oriented technology. Nowadays, the existing E-health fog or CCN are seen as separate and autonomous networks, but many applications could require that those E-health fog computing systems exchange data, share processing results, or subscribe to each other information flux. In this paper we propose a solution for E-health systems to communicate by combining fog computing and CCN to provide communication efficiency and local storage opportunities. Finally we use simulation to evaluate the delay performances of our proposal.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;E-health fog computing systems;delay performances;autonomous networks;content distribution;CCN;Content-Centric Network approach;E-Health systems;end-to-user services;local storage opportunities;IoT environment;fog computing paradigm;emergency context;privacy matters;safe local storage spaces;life-dependency situations;IoT solutions;content-centric fog networks;Edge computing;Delays;Sensors;Protocols;Computer architecture;Routing;FOG computing;CCN;E-health;IoT},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210830},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application.

Nowadays, the public basically gets information about UV radiation through weather forecasts, which can only provide rough and average prediction for a certain large area. Since CMOS sensors in smartphone cameras are very sensitive to UV radiation, smartphones have potential to be the ideal equipment to measure it. At the same time, result optimization can be achieved in real time by taking advantage of fog computing because fog servers are able to aggregate UV radiation data and compute the results at local areas. This paper exhaustively discussed a novel procedure that could measure UV radiation through smartphone cameras, and also briefly covered how to leverage fog computing to improve UV measurement accuracy. To implement the procedure, an Android app called UV meter was developed. Experiments were conducted by utilizing the app to validate and evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the procedure on both smartphones and smart watches. Results showed that the proposed procedure could achieve an average of 95% accuracy of a typical professional digital UV meter, and could be easily implemented on smart devices.},   keywords={cameras;cloud computing;measurement;sensors;smart phones;ultraviolet radiation effects;fog servers;fog computing;smartphone cameras;CMOS sensors;smart devices;UV radiation measurement;ultraviolet radiation measurement;Cameras;Intelligent sensors;Smart devices;Sea measurements;Meteorology;Edge computing;Fog computing;smart devices;ultraviolet (UV) measurement},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2717845},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

The IoT technology is also envisioned to play an important role in improving the effectiveness of military operations in battlefields. The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to battlefield specific challenges, such as the absence of communication infrastructure, heterogeneity of devices, and susceptibility to cyber-physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and information dissemination in the presence of adversaries. This paper aims to build the theoretical foundations of designing secure and reconfigurable IoBT networks. Leveraging the theories of stochastic geometry and mathematical epidemiology, we develop an integrated framework to quantify the information dissemination among heterogeneous network devices. Consequently, a tractable optimization problem is formulated that can assist commanders in cost effectively planning the network and reconfiguring it according to the changing mission requirements.},   keywords={decision making;information dissemination;Internet of Things;military communication;military computing;optimisation;security of data;secure IoBT networks;reconfigurable IoBT networks;heterogeneous network devices;critical information dissemination;management;control;automated systems;paradigm shift;smart homes;smart cities;health care;IoT technology;military operations;battlefields;combat equipment;battlefield resources;coordinated automated decisions;battlefield specific challenges;cyber-physical attacks;combat efficiency;coordinated decision-making;IoT networks;Internet of battlefield things;reconfigurable multilayer network design;changing mission requirements;Geometry;Communication networks;Mathematical model;Multiplexing;Wireless communication;Stochastic processes;Ad hoc networks;Battlefield;epidemics;Internet of Things;multiplex networks;Poisson point process;random geometric graph},   doi={10.1109/TWC.2018.2799860},   ISSN={1536-1276},   month={April},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Wearable health devices, mobile apps and diagnostic tools revolutionize the medical field by introducing new assisting devices for patients in a way to create comfort, communication and augmented intelligence. Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.},   keywords={artificial intelligence;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;social networking (online);diagnostic tools;augmented intelligence;sensor devices;gateway;evidence-based medicine system;SMEAD;end-to-end secured system;diabetic patients;medication;insulin dosage;cryptographic security;formalized data access;secured mobile enabled assisting device;wearable health devices;mobile apps;cloud-based platforms;Internet of Things;MEDIBOX;blockchain-based disruptive technology;smart contracts;social networks;diabetics monitoring;patient assisting devices;privacy;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diabetes;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security;Temperature sensors;Diabetics Monitoring;MEDIBOX;Blockchain;IOT;Mobile Phone},   doi={10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384099},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, each of these integrated communication media is not primarily meant for the specific purpose of data communication, as PLC and VLC have historically served to transfer electrical energy transfer and light, respectively. With the advent of high flickering rate light emitting diodes and efficient multiplexing/modulation schemes, both technologies are observed as potential data communication carriers. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for modifying the modulation technique in accordance with the channel requirements of a hybrid PLC-VLC-based 5G communication systems. We provide a thorough analysis of the research work done to co-use these two technologies for data communication, suggest some exciting applications of integrated PLC-VLC systems and propose discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to tune the physical parameters as per the hybrid channel characteristics. Theoretical and simulation bit-error-rate results exhibit that DWT-OFDM outperforms an OFDM-based PLC-VLC system.

Unlike previous studies, these subjects used their own personal phone, in any way that was convenient to them, and engaged in their routine in their natural environments. Unscripted behavior and unconstrained phone usage resulted in situations that were harder to recognize. The authors demonstrate how fusion of multimodal sensors is important for resolving such cases. They present a baseline system and encourage researchers to use their public dataset to compare methods and improve context recognition in the wild.},   keywords={behavioural sciences computing;geriatrics;mobile computing;sensor fusion;smart phones;health monitoring;context recognition;sensor data;personal phone;multimodal sensors;smartphones;smartwatches;detailed human context recognition;automatic person behavioral context recognition;Machine learning;Smart phones;Data collection;Pervasive computing;Biomedical monitoring;Performance evaluation;Bioinformatics;Intelligent systems;Context awareness;Mobile sensors;context awareness;mobile sensors;artificial intelligence;machine learning;human activity recognition;intelligent systems;mobile;pervasive computing;Internet of Things;healthcare;bioinformatics},   doi={10.1109/MPRV.2017.3971131},   ISSN={1536-1268},   month={October},}

In order for users to get the provided services, they have to access these services, provide and exchange a lot of personal information in an open, unsafe and interconnected environment. Therefore, user information may be exposed to privacy violations, which is especially critical for healthcare related services. Privacy engineering challenges that are not considered in design and development of these services may lead to possible privacy holes and leakage points, which raise concerns among users. In this paper, a privacy engineering approach and safeguard framework are proposed for smart city healthcare services.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={180-183},   abstract={Complex Event Processing (CEP) is widely used for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). However, the state-of-the-art techniques use a centralized server to receive health sensor streams and detect complex events. This paper introduces an Internet of Things (IoT) based CEP approach that uses a mobile device on the edge and a remote IoT Hospital Server (IHS) deployed on the cloud. The prototype implementation of the system uses an open-source Siddhi CEP engine on the mobile device and an open-source Web Services Oxygen (WSO2) IoT Server on the IHS. In this architecture, complete complex event detection is performed on the edge and the complex event streams are sent to the hospital server using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The MQTT broker forwards complex event streams to an event listener service running on the hospital server that notifies the hospital staff. Advantages of performing CEP on the edge include circumventing out-of-order delivery of various health sensor streams, avoiding queuing delays at the hospital server and reducing the user cost for data transfer between the mobile device and the hospital server. Also, this technique provides the ability to generate local alarms for the patient even when the mobile network connecting the device to the hospital server is unavailable.},   keywords={Mobile handsets;Servers;Graphical user interfaces;Hospitals;Sensor systems;Engines;Mobile Complex Event Processing;Remote Patient Monitoring System},   doi={10.1109/ICIOT.2018.00034},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

 title={Privacy Preservation in e-Healthcare Environments: State of the Art and Future Directions}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={464-478},   abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity, and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end-to-end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks, to incorporating the Internet of Things, to communication links, and to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise are of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level toward the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision making regarding their protected health information/electronic health record. A lot of works and efforts are necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, and identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;medical information systems;data privacy;patient privacy;e-Healthcare systems;e-Healthcare enterprise;end-to-end privacy;healthcare services;Privacy;Medical services;Electronic mail;Wireless sensor networks;Access control;Data privacy;e-Healthcare;privacy;anonymity;access control},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767561},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Furthermore, in order to optimize the energy consumption in these monitoring systems, compression techniques have been widely deployed. Compressive sensing (CS) has gained a lot of attention in ECG monitoring as a result of its ability to leverage the ECG signal structure in order to achieve a high efficient acquisition scheme. The paper investigates the incorporation of CS in IoT-based ECG monitoring platforms. The platform consists of a CS-based compression and recovery, in addition, the platform provides an abnormality detection for each heart beat using different pattern recognition algorithms. The obtained results reveal that transmitting only 15 % of the samples is enough to recover the signal efficiently. Moreover, using up to 20% of the total sample can achieve a high classification accuracy as using the original data with a maximum drop down of 3.3 % in the worst case scenario.},   keywords={cardiovascular system;compressed sensing;diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern recognition;electrocardiogram monitoring;monitoring systems;compression techniques;ECG monitoring platforms;IoT based compressive sensing;remote monitoring;chronic cardiovascular diseases;ECG signal structure;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sensors;Compressed sensing;Correlation;Sparse matrices;Internet of things(IoT);connected health;ECG;compressive sensing (CS);Classification},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.32},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

More other diseases such as chickenpox, malaria, etc. are also serious threat to people's physical and mental health. Therefore proper techniques for disease surveillance are highly demanded. Recently, social media analysis is regarded as an efficient way to achieve this goal, which is feasible since growing number of people post their health information to social media such as blogs, personal website, etc. Previous work on social media analysis mainly focused on English materials but hardly considered Chinese materials, which hinders the use of such technique for Chinese people. In this paper, we proposed a new method of Chinese social media analysis for disease surveillance. More specifically, we compared different kinds of methods in the process of classification, and then proposed a new way to process Chinese text data. The Chinese Sina micro-blog data collected from September to December 2013 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that a high classification precision of 87.49% in average is obtained. Comparing with the data from the authority, Chinese national influenza center, we can predict the outbreak time of flu 5 days earlier.},   keywords={diseases;medical information systems;natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis;deaths;seasonal flu;chickenpox;malaria;physical health;mental health;disease surveillance;health information;blogs;personal Website;Chinese social media analysis;classification process;Chinese text data;Chinese Sina microblog data;classification precision;Chinese national influenza center;outbreak time prediction;Media;Diseases;Support vector machines;Surveillance;Blogs;Influenza;Internet;KeywordsSocial media; Chinese;SVMLIGHT;},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2014.11},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks. We evaluated both protocols through a specific e-health scenario. Tests revealed the usage of mobile networks increases response time and overhead of both protocols, on average, when compared to traditional networks.},   keywords={computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;middleware;protocols;radiocommunication;TLS protocols;DTLS protocols;IoT middleware systems;Internet of Things;communication services;mobile networks;IoT applications;e-health applications;communication layer;IoT systems;e-health environment;network latency;packet loss;Middleware;Protocols;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Authentication;Time factors},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983155},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

A critical issue in M2M communications is the energy efficiency as typically the machine devices are powered by batteries of low capacity and thus, it is the key to optimize their consumption. To achieve higher energy efficiency, this paper proposes the adoption of contexts through a generic context-aware framework for M2M communications. With this framework, machine devices dynamically adapt their settings depending on a series of characteristics such as data reporting mode, QoS features, and network conditions to achieve higher energy efficiency and extend the operating lifetime of M2M networks. Simulation results are provided for four commonly used M2M applications. The results demonstrate considerable energy savings and operating lifetime extension on the network when the proposed context-aware framework is used. Thus, it is shown that contexts play an important role on the energy efficiency of M2M systems.},   keywords={cellular radio;Internet of Things;optimisation;quality of service;telecommunication power management;context-awareness;machine-to-machine communications;Internet of things;cellular network;M2M communications;data reporting mode;QoS features;data reporting mode;energy efficiency;Context;Servers;Quality of service;Energy consumption;Conferences;Magnetic heads;Machine-to-machine communications;M2M;Context-Awareness;Energy Efficiency;Internet of Things;MTC},   doi={10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849321},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Using Received Signal Strength (RSS), the paper also proposes an approach for obstacle localization, mapping and classification. The latter is done by firstly estimating the positions of virtual anchor nodes (VANs), known as mirrors of the real anchor with respect to obstacle. Then, the obstacle position and dimensions are found via the estimation of the reflector points on the obstacle. Using Snell's law and the relation between RSS and reflection coefficient, different obstacles can be classified as per their material composition. Simulation results have shown the accuracy of the proposed approach in context inference and mapping. The work here will open the door for multiple applications in robotics, health, radar-like systems, and Internet of Things (IoT).},   keywords={direction-of-arrival estimation;electromagnetic wave propagation;geometry;time-of-arrival estimation;geometric approach;simultaneous context inference;AoA;ToA;indoor environment;single static receiver;millimeter wave propagation characteristics;MMW;Received Signal Strength;RSS;obstacle localization;virtual anchor nodes;VANs;mirrors;obstacle position;Angle-of-Arrival;access points;Time of Arrival;context inference;context mapping;robotics;health;radar-like systems;Internet of Things;IoT;reflection coefficient;Snell's law;reflector points;Receivers;Estimation;Millimeter wave technology;Scattering;Transmitters;Indoor environments;Millimeter wave communication;Millimeter wave;Localization;Mapping;Context Inference;Virtual Anchor nNde (VAN);Obstacle Detection and Classficiation},   doi={10.1109/ICT.2018.8464834},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Emergency notification mechanism has to be hassle free and quick, in order to have efficient response for any disaster, health-fix, act of terrorism, etc. In this paper, we present service architecture for emergency alert, using Fog computing. Fog computing brings cloud resources close to the underlying devices and IoTs, which makes it ideal for latency sensitive services. Furthermore, Fog is used for offloading resource constrained devices. Our smart phone based service, known as Emergency Help Alert Mobile Cloud (E-HAMC) provides a quick way of notifying the relevant emergency dealing department, utilizing the services of Fog for offloading as well as pre-processing purposes. The service sends the location of incident and contacts the appropriate emergency dealing department automatically through already stored contact numbers. The emergency related information is then synchronized automatically from Fog to the Cloud, allowing further analysis and improvement in safety of the people and creates extended portfolio of services for the concerned authorities as well as the users. Performance in most certain scenarios is also evaluated and presented in this study, which shows the applicability of our system and its future prospects.},   keywords={cloud computing;emergency management;Internet of Things;mobile computing;E-HAMC;fog computing;emergency alert service architecture;cloud resources;IoT;latency sensitive services;smart phone based service;Emergency Help Alert Mobile Cloud;offloading;emergency related information;Delays;Accidents;Emergency services;Cloud computing;Synchronization;Vehicles;Mobile communication;M2M;mobile cloud computing;emergency alert;Fog computing;Micro Data Center (MDC);Edge Computing},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134091},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={The pervasive computing discipline has evolved substantially since its inception. A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues.

Counterfeited medicines have an adverse effect on the public health and cause revenue loss to the legitimate manufacturing organizations. In this paper, we propose a new authentication scheme for medicine anticounterfeiting system in the Internet of Things environment which is used for checking the authenticity of pharmaceutical products (dosage forms). The proposed scheme utilizes the near field communication (NFC) and is suitable for mobile environment, which also provides efficient NFC update phase. The security analysis using the widely accepted real-or-random model proves that the proposed scheme provides the session key security. The proposed scheme also protects other known attacks which are analyzed informally. Furthermore, the formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool shows that the proposed scheme is secure. The scheme is efficient with respect to computation and communication costs, and also it provides additional functionality features when compared to other existing schemes. Finally, for demonstration of the practicality of the scheme, we evaluate it using the broadly accepted NS2 simulation.},   keywords={counterfeit goods;cryptography;drugs;Internet of Things;message authentication;near-field communication;pharmaceutical industry;medicine anticounterfeiting system;pharmaceutical products;efficient NFC update phase;session key security;formal security verification;broadly accepted automated validation;secure authentication scheme;medicine anti-counterfeiting system;counterfeited medicines;Internet of Things;Servers;Authentication;Drugs;Counterfeiting;Mobile handsets;Internet of Things;Organizations;Anti-counterfeiting;authentication;automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA);NS2 simulation;security},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2706752},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

Although face-to-face behavioral programs have proven to be most effective, they are expensive and often inaccessible. The use of virtual worlds has been emerging as an alternative to perform experiments, as it offers to the user a sense of reality, allowing interaction with 3D objects. This paper discusses the use of the Internet of Things in virtual worlds, with a view to encourage obese individuals to learn more about self-care in order to improve their life quality and lose weight. One of the key factors to deal with obesity is the engagement of the subject. The qualitative research investigated the impact of the alliance of 3D virtual worlds with the Internet of Things and mobile devices as elements capable of promoting motivation in subjects enrolled in an obesity control program. This set of technologies was used as a support strategy aimed at offering to the user the feeling of "being present" in a context particularly developed to encourage motivation and learning with the interaction with 3D objects. This paper has a cutout on the pedagogical use of the theoretical background, which is the Theory of Self-determination and it explains how the software that validated the proposal was developed.

A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;adaptive LPA validation model;LPAV-IoT;data reliability;IoT healthcare environments;mobile apps;LPA data;IoT environment;data validation model;lifelogging data;personal data;healthcare studies;healthcare system;personalized healthcare platform;lifelogging physical activity;Internet of things;Medical services;Uncertainty;Biomedical monitoring;Adaptation models;Reliability;Data models;Data validation;Internet of Things (IoT);personalized healthcare;physical activity},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2016.2586075},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1-12},   abstract={This paper presents a new platform to monitor the arm and hand activity of stroke patients during rehabilitation exercises in the hospital and at home during their daily living activities. The platform provides relevant data to the therapist in order to assess the patients physical state and adapt the rehabilitation program if necessary. The platform consists of a self-contained smart cup that can be used to perform exercises that are similar to everyday tasks such as drinking. The first smart cup prototype, the design of which was based on interviews regarding the needs of therapists, contains various sensors that collect information about its orientation, the liquid level, its position compared to a reference target and tremors. The prototype also includes audio and visual displays that provide feedback to patients about their movements. Two studies were carried out in conjunction with healthcare professionals and patients. The first study focused on collecting feedback from healthcare professionals to assess the functionalities of the cup and to improve the prototype. Based on this paper, we designed an improved prototype and created a visualization tool for therapists. Finally, we carried out a preliminary study involving nine patients who had experienced an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in the previous 24 months. This preliminary study focused on assessing the usability and acceptability of the cup to the patients. The results showed that the cup was very well accepted by eight of the nine patients in monitoring their activity within a rehabilitation center or at home. Moreover, these eight patients had almost no concerns about the design of the cup and its usability.},   keywords={Monitoring;Sensors;Visualization;Task analysis;Biomedical monitoring;Prototypes;Tools;Stroke;monitoring;Internet of Things;home;rehabilitation},   doi={10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2853553},   ISSN={2168-2372},   month={},}

There are several mature frameworks that address these issues, but they have been developed within the context of organised hospitals and care providers, where there is the expertise, processing power, communications and electrical power to support highly robust security. However, for IoT solutions aimed at vulnerable people, either at home or within their local environment, there are significant additional constraints that must be overcome. These include technical (low processing capability, power constrained, intermittent communications) organisational (how to enrol and revoke users and devices, distribution of cryptographic keys) and user constraints (how does a patient with physical and/or mental challenges configure and update their devices).

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={4},   pages={24-32},   abstract={With the evolution of the Internet of Things, mutual sharing of information becomes easy among various smart devices across the globe. In such an environment, smart healthcare also needs to be expedited with an aim to provide remote diagnosis to patients located across the globe. However, as the sensitive information about a patient travels using an open channel (i.e., the Internet), there are chances of misusing this information. Hence, there is a requirement for a strong crypto mechanism for securely processing smart healthcare data. Most of the solutions reported in the literature use heavy computation-based solutions for providing security to smart healthcare data, which may not be suitable in view of less resources for modern smart devices. In this article, we propose a novel lattice-based secure cryptosystem for smart healthcare (LSCSH) in future smart cities. LSCSH uses a lightweight key exchange and an authentication mechanism at several stages. The proposed scheme has been evaluated with respect to the communication and computation costs in comparison to the other competitive schemes.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={A1-A1},   abstract={The silicon Integrated circuits (ICs) continues to have an unprecedented impact on improving almost every aspect of modern society including communications, military, security, healthcare, energy saving, industrial automation, transport, and entertainment. Over the last four decades, the relentless pursuit of IC device miniaturization for manufacturing high-performance and high-density IC-chips and system-on-a-chip (SoC) led to the creation of Internet and social media. The semiconductor components are used in smart cars, smart homes, smart cities, smart health, smart energy, smart security, smart appliances, and so on. The Internet enables connecting any and every smart devices or “things” creating “Internet of Things” (IoT) or Internet of everything (IoE). And, the IoT-connected smart devices constitute a smart environment and integrated ecosystem that can be accessed via personal computers, tablets, and smartphones from anywhere without human interaction. However, the performance of nanoscale-MOSFETs in the design and manufacturing of “smart” electronic products necessary to create smart networks or “smart things” to enable smart environments and integrated ecosystems is inadequate due to the fundamental physical limitations such as short channel effects (SCEs). Shrinking conventional bulk MOSFET device dimensions in the decananometer regime degrades device performance including degradation in the subthreshold swing and decrease in device turn-on voltage. As a result, the scaled MOSFETs cannot be turned off easily by lowering the gate voltage leading to excessive leakage current. Due to SCEs, the device characteristics become increasingly sensitive to process variation that imposes a serious challenge for continued scaling of bulk-MOSFETs for the nanometer technology nodes. In addition, at gate length below 20-nm, the sub-surface leakage paths are weakly controlled by the gate irrespective of gate oxide thickness and their potential barriers can be easily lowered by drain bias through the enhanced electric field coupling to the drain. Thus, to surmount the continuous scaling challenges of conventional bulk MOSFET devices new device technologies such as FinFET has emerged as the real alternative to MOSFETs. This tutorial provides the basic features and operating principles of FinFETs required for the understanding of design and manufacturing of advanced ICs at the nanometer nodes for smart electronic products. In addition, this tutorial also discusses the emerging undoped or lightly-doped channel MOSFETs with performance comparable to FinFETs for design and manufacturing of smart IC products.},   keywords={MOSFET;Manufacturing;Logic gates;Integrated circuit modeling;Tutorials;Nanoscale devices},   doi={10.1109/SMELEC.2018.8481323},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays a key role in connecting the e-health system with the cyber world through new services and seamless interconnection between heterogeneous devices. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy, and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.},   keywords={artificial bee colony algorithm;Big Data;data analysis;electronic health records;Internet of Things;Kalman filters;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;features selection model;big data;e-health system;cyber world;heterogeneous devices;system architecture;Artificial Bee Colony;Kalman filter;Hadoop ecosystem;four-tier architecture;unnecessary data;ABC algorithm;parallel algorithm;MapReduce tool;MapReduce;internet of e-health things;ABC;Swarm approaches;data analysis;Big Data;Feature extraction;Algorithm design and analysis;Real-time systems;Meteorology;Intelligent sensors},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254418},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Real Time Failure Prediction of Load Balancers and Firewalls}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={822-827},   abstract={Load balancers and firewalls are entry points to many key websites in any network infrastructure. Any downtime due to these devices, even for a few minutes, may result in major business impact. There are many proactive event management systems/products which can monitor their health and alert on device failure. However, predicting failure with sufficient lead time still remains a challenging problem. Event management systems take system log messages and simple network management protocol (SNMP) traps as inputs and typically use rule based framework to generate network events. In this paper we discuss how we can use event data alone to build predictive model for device failures. Here all event data is generated by an event management tool. Event data volume is substantially less compared to full system log data. Also, these network devices fail rarely. Lower volume of event data enables us collect historical data for longer durations and thus collect decent number of failure samples over time which we can use for training and validation. We present a prediction model for failure events based on event sequence data. We have introduced new stratified sampling techniques along with a new feature engineering method using sliding time windows on event data. Experiments show that for rare device failure events like the load balancers it suffices to use event data to model device failures instead of using raw system log data. We have evaluated binary classification algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). Experimental results show that with the proper noise cleanup technique and model tuning we can achieve precision of 77% and recall of 67% for the failure predictions of network devices only from event data.},   keywords={firewalls;real-time systems;regression analysis;resource allocation;support vector machines;Web sites;real time failure prediction;load balancers;firewalls;Web sites;network infrastructure;business impact;management systems;device failure;simple network management protocol;SNMP;data volume;historical data;sequence data;stratified sampling techniques;feature engineering method;rare device failure;support vector machines;SVM;binary classification algorithms;logistic regression;network devices;failure predictions;Monitoring;Predictive models;Training;Training data;Tools;Lead;Failure Prediction;Machine Learning;Big Data;SVM;Network},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.171},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Gone are the days of the technologically challenged generation. People are now aware of different devices and applications that help track, monitor and analyze different health metrics which can prove really effective in diagnosing various life-threatening diseases. This is where a new segment of fitness wearable devices, Internet of Fitness Things (IoFT), comes into the picture. We can now connect these different sensors, devices and applications together into one seamless and cohesive health and fitness system. With this integration, the user now has access to all his vital health stats which can be easily visualized through a comprehensible user interface, can be stored in his personalized health profile on the cloud and also let the physician have easy access to that profile for quick diagnosis and medicine prescription, all without breaking a sweat. This paper discusses the concept of these IoFT wearable devices and how the sensors inside these devices interact with the user and the cloud. A new methodology to help patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and similar life-threatening diseases based on the IoFT is also proposed in this paper.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;Internet of Fitness Things;sensor-cloud network;protocols;OSA patients;life-threatening diseases;fitness wearable devices;cohesive health;fitness system;comprehensible user interface;personalized health profile;medicine prescription;IoFT wearable devices;obstructive sleep apnea;Protocols;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Bluetooth;Internet of Things;Wearables;IoFT;OSA},   doi={10.1109/RAICS.2015.7488443},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={192-196},   abstract={Edible mushrooms are one of the important agricultural products, and their ingredients, having huge economic benefits, are beneficial to human health. Button mushrooms are the most commercially grown mushrooms globally. With the progress of science and technology, the method for growing mushrooms has progressed to the mode of closed greenhouse cultivation. With a stable environment that is not influenced by external climate changes, greenhouse microclimate can be used to replace natural climate. However, the commonly used mushroom greenhouse control system in Taiwan used an on/off control mode, which were incapable of enabling precise adjustments based on the greenhouse size and current greenhouse conditions. Instead, the system parameters had to be set by mushroom farmers based on their own experience, where sufficient experience was required to find the optimal results. To this end, this study proposed a Fuzzy control system of greenhouse microclimate for mushrooms to solve this problem, where a Fuzzy microclimate regulator was employed to adjust the CO2 concentration in a real-time manner, and the information was transmitted to mobile devices instantly through technology of internet of things, which enabled farmers to keep abreast of the greenhouse conditions at any time. The performance of three control methods was compared in this study, in which the results of mushroom spawn running were used to verify that this system could exactly achieve higher plant quality.},   keywords={agriculture;crops;fuzzy control;greenhouses;quality control;research and development;temperature control;greenhouse microclimate;mushroom spawn running;fuzzy control system;button mushroom;edible mushrooms;closed greenhouse cultivation;agricultural products;mushroom greenhouse control system;fuzzy microclimate regulator;Taiwan;CO<sub>2</sub>;Green products;Air pollution;Humidity;Fans;Fuzzy control;intelligent agriculture;greenhouse;control system;Fuzzy;internet of things},   doi={10.1109/ICOT.2017.8336120},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={2},   pages={163-168},   abstract={In IoT-based healthcare, medical devices are more vulnerable to numerous security threats and attacks than other network devices. Current solutions are able to provide protection to patients' data during data transmission to some extent, but cannot prevent some sophisticated threats and attacks such as collusion attacks and data leakage. In this article, we first investigate the challenges with privacy protected data collection. Then we propose a practical framework called PrivacyProtector, patient privacy protected data collection, with the objective of preventing these types of attacks. PrivacyProtector includes the ideas of secret sharing and share repairing (in case of data loss or compromise) for patients' data privacy. Since it is the first time, we apply the Slepian- Wolf-coding-based secret sharing (SW-SSS) in PrivacyProtector. In the framework, we use a distributed database consisting of multiple cloud servers, which ensures that the privacy of patients' personal data can remain protected as long as one of the servers remains uncompromised. We also present a patient access control scheme in which multiple cloud servers collaborate in shared construction to offer patients' data to healthcare providers without revealing the content of the data. The privacy performance analysis has shown that the PrivacyProtector framework is secure and privacy-protected against various attacks.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;collusion attacks;data leakage;privacy protected data collection;patient privacy;data loss;patient access control scheme;healthcare providers;privacy performance analysis;PrivacyProtector framework;privacy-protected patient data collection;IoT;healthcare systems;medical devices;network devices;data transmission;cloud servers;security threats;Slepian-Wolf-coding-based secret sharing;Cryptography;Servers;Medical services;Data privacy;Maintenance engineering;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700364},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={Feb},}

To realise the full benefit of IoT, it is imperative that the infrastructure we depend upon is adequate to deliver the services envisioned and has the necessary resilience, robustness and security. The infrastructure industry is itself attempting to ensure that, in delivering advanced infrastructure, it operates in a smarter, more technologically-supported and information-driven manner. To underpin and support a co-ordinated strategy for smarter infrastructure development, there are a number of important and useful guidelines, best practices and standards that are being developed. However, the alignment of these approaches is not always optimal, and as such interoperability presents a significant challenge. This paper examines the landscape of standards and guidance, the security challenges presented and the difficulty in ensuring compliance.

Blood centers collect, process and transport blood to hospitals and other health care centers. Sometimes blood is collected directly from blood donors rather than taking it from blood bank. Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases. The proposed system is a web based application which helps to reduce the human mistakes or errors and different techniques can be applied for blood type classification, diagnosing diabetic symptoms, classifying blood type and identifying different donors reaction and apply preventive measures against them.},   keywords={data mining;health care;Internet;medical information systems;pattern recognition;safety;DonorHART system;blood donor safety;donor reactions information;risk monitoring;automatic pattern recognition;Web based application;data mining;Blood;Data mining;Classification algorithms;Safety;Cloud computing;Pattern matching;Machine learning algorithms;Blood Bank;DonorHart tool;Data Mining;Database;Classification algorithm},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380516},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

However, the Big Data nature of IoT data imposes challenges that need to be addressed in order to provide scalable and efficient IoT data-driven infrastructures. We tackle these issues and focus on the problems of describing the meaning of IoT streaming data using ontologies and integrating this data in a knowledge graph.

Resulting knowledge graphs model the semantics or meaning of merged data in terms of entities that satisfy the SPARQL queries and relationships among those entities; thus, only data required for query answering is included in the knowledge graph.

Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure.

This can substantially expand the scope of applications, both in number and in value. But first, translation into applications requires a base of system functions (instrumentation, computation, power management, communication). These cannot be realized on the desired scale by large-area electronics alone. It is necessary to combine large-area electronics with high-performance, high-efficiency technologies, such as crystalline silicon CMOS, within hybrid systems. Scalable hybrid systems require rethinking the subsystem architectures from the start by considering how the technologies should be interfaced, on both a functional and physical level. To explore platform architectures along with the supporting circuits and devices, we consider as an application driver, a self-powered sheet for high-resolution structural health monitoring (of bridges and buildings).

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Automated Test Systems (ATSs) can join the Internet of Things (IoT) at multiple layers and benefit both the overall IoT concept as well as advance the goals of ATSs. Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data. The paper also outlines how these concepts extend to related topics such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Everything (IoE).

 title={Enabling Dynamic and Lightweight Management of Distributed Bluetooth Low Energy Devices}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={620-624},   abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although recent versions of BLE embrace the 6LoWPAN standard for IPv6 low-power device communication, this is often not the best choice for constrained-node networks due to downsides such as increased memory and computation overhead, heavier network stack, increased power consumption, backward incompatibility, etc. A crucial requirement for successful IoT solutions is an efficient strategy for monitoring and control of highly distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight model for management of distributed constrained BLE nodes based on OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol. To this end, we have designed a new intermediate component, a BLE-LWM2M gateway (GW), which has dual roles: a BLE master that monitors and controls the BLE devices, and a LWM2M client that acts on behalf of an operator's LWM2M management server. The BLE-LWM2M GW has interfaces to dynamically manage connected BLE devices as LWM2M objects, called ObjectTwins, in runtime without a need for user configuration. All services that BLE devices provide are mapped to the ObjectTwins in the gateway, which are exposed to the LWM2M server. Hence, this model enables a LWM2M server to manage distributed BLE devices by interacting with the BLE-LWM2M GW using the LWM2M standard methods, and the constrained devices can still use a native Bluetooth communication protocol. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of a mobile healthcare system has been implemented in a testbed.},   keywords={Bluetooth;distributed sensors;Internet of Things;internetworking;personal area networks;protocols;wireless communication technology;IPv6 low-power device communication;constrained-node networks;computation overhead;distributed constrained BLE nodes;BLE master;LWM2M client;connected BLE devices;LWM2M objects;distributed BLE devices;LWM2M standard methods;constrained devices;native Bluetooth communication protocol;power consumption;distributed sensor nodes;dynamic management model;distributed Bluetooth low energy devices;lightweight management model;6LoWPAN standard;IoT solutions;OMA lightweight M2M protocol;BLE-LWM2M gateway;operator LWM2M management server;ObjectTwins;Servers;Bluetooth;Protocols;Monitoring;Logic gates;Internet;Wireless sensor networks},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390355},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

For instance, research and development of real-time systems has been done in domains such as control systems, avionics, operations research et cetera for over 50 years. With BigData analytics becoming mainstream since the turn of the century and the growing need to leverage real-time data to grow business, several real-time systems are being researched and deployed in the consumer space. Although a lot of emphasis is being laid on real-time processing, the notion of real-time is not well defined. This, in part, stems from the fact that the notion of real-time is a function of the target application.

These Smart Things are destined to manage the security of our houses, watch our health, and optimize the energy consumption of our cities. They bring a new set of opportunities, but they also present high challenges regarding scalability, management, bootstrapping, identity verification and authentication. For that reason, this work is focused on addressing the security requirements for Smart Things providing an optimized family of primes for Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC), denominated Shifting Primes. ECC on Smart Things needs special optimizations for the cryptographic primitives that requires a precise study of the instruction set and the number of cycles for those instructions. The modular multiplication is the basic operation, critical for highly constrained microprocessors, in terms of which ECC is built. It is optimized and also analyzed the interaction between partial results in the chain of modular multiplications needed for ECC. This optimizations have been carried out over the MSP430, which is a widely extended microprocessor for Smart Things. MSP430 is featured by not offering hardware multiplier. For that reason, we have defined a special kind of prime numbers, the Shifting Primes. They are featured by offering a very fast multiplication algorithm for ECC through addition and shifting operations for the multiplications. It is presented the full faster multiplication algorithm for Shifting Primes. These results are presenting a lowest time and number of operations for the multiplication in ECC than the existing solutions. Finally, note that the presented primes can be applied also to other similar architectures with fast shifting operation on registers.},   keywords={Internet;public key cryptography;shifting primes;optimizing elliptic curve cryptography;smart things;Internet;energy consumption;ECC;constrained microprocessors;hardware multiplier;MSP430;Elliptic curve cryptography;Hardware;Registers;Manganese;Optimization;Internet of Things;Shifting Primes;Montgomery Multiplication;Elliptic Curve Cryptography;Point Representation},   doi={10.1109/IMIS.2012.199},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

In certain sense, indoor air quality must be paid more attention than outdoor air quality as people spend more time indoors than outdoors. The indoor environments are confined and closed compared to external environments providing less opportunity for the pollutants to dilute. With the advancement of technology, working places have become more automated using machines to carry out the tasks that were hitherto done manually. These devices emit various solids and gases into the environment during their operation. These emissions contain many substances that are harmful to human health, when exposed to them for a prolonged period of time or more than certain levels of concentration. This paper proposes an IoT based indoor air quality monitoring system for tracking the ozone concentrations near a photocopy machine. The experimental system with a semiconductor sensor capable of monitoring ozone concentrations was installed near a high volume photocopier. The IoT device has been programmed to collect and transmit data at an interval of five minutes over blue tooth connection to a gateway node that in turn communicates with the processing node via the WiFi local area network. The sensor was calibrated using the standard calibration methods.

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={5356-5373},   abstract={Internet of Things is smartly changing various existing research areas into new themes, including smart health, smart home, smart industry, and smart transport. Relying on the basis of “smart transport,” Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is evolving as a new theme of research and development from vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This paper presents a comprehensive framework of IoV with emphasis on layered architecture, protocol stack, network model, challenges, and future aspects. Specifically, following the background on the evolution of VANETs and motivation on IoV an overview of IoV is presented as the heterogeneous vehicular networks. The IoV includes five types of vehicular communications, namely, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-roadside, vehicle-to-infrastructure of cellular networks, vehicle-to-personal devices, and vehicle-to-sensors. A five layered architecture of IoV is proposed considering functionalities and representations of each layer. A protocol stack for the layered architecture is structured considering management, operational, and security planes.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={83-88},   abstract={One of the challenges of Fifth Generation (5G) networks is how to support massive number of wireless devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT will interconnect billions of devices under machine-to-machine communication links (M2M). However, this massive connectivity will create burden on the cellular network. Fixed sensors and wearable devices are expected to make the majority of future IoT traffic. And scheduling their huge traffic is the scope of this work. Sensors mobility has been considered with three speed, namely zero speed sensors (fixed), and medium and high speed of 30 and 100kmph, to simulate sensors in vehicles, and model the impact of vehicle mobility on the M2M links. This work defines the dimensionality in terms of the number of M2M devices that can be successfully connected, the required bandwidth, sensors mobility, and the transmission mode used. The mutual use of multi antennas, dense deployment of small cells, and the adoption of millimetre wave band, particularly in the 28GHz have been considered as the key enabling technologies to address the massive traffic generated by IoT. An algorithm has been set to schedule this type of traffic and to show whether the M2M devices completed their traffic upload or failed to reach the margin.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;cellular radio;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;microwave antenna arrays;telecommunication traffic;millimetre wave 5G network;wireless devices;machine-to-machine communication links;massive connectivity;cellular network;fixed sensors;wearable devices;sensors mobility;zero speed sensors;vehicle mobility;millimetre wave band;massive traffic;traffic upload;fifth generation networks;IoT traffic;Internet of Things;M2M links;massive M2M traffic scheduling;frequency 28.0 GHz;Machine-to-machine communications;5G mobile communication;Temperature sensors;Brain modeling;Biomedical monitoring;Intelligent sensors;5G network;millimetre wave;M2M;IoT;connected health},   doi={10.1109/CEEC.2017.8101604},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Among different technologies for IoT, wireless-sensor-network (WSN) is one of key technologies to be developed. To demonstrate WSN capabilities in applications, this work developed self-developed sensor node (Super-Node) and applied the device into an on-field structure-health-monitoring (SHM) task. The developed WSN system achieved requirements of SHM applications, i.e. 128 Hz sampling rate with tri-axial acceleration data within one sensor node. By acquired data, the developed system can make the prediction of structure status.

However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases.

 title={Lossless In-Network Processing in WSNs for Domain-Specific Monitoring Applications}, 
  year={2017},   volume={13},   number={5},   pages={2130-2139},   abstract={Internet of things (IOT) is emerging as sensing paradigms in many domain-specific monitoring applications in smart cities, such as structural health monitoring (SHM) and smart grid monitoring. Due to the large size of the monitoring objects (e.g., civil structure or the power grid), plenty of sensors need to be deployed and organized to be a large scale of multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which tends to have quite high transmission cost. In-network processing is an efficient way to reduce the transmission cost in WSNs. However, implementing in-network processing for above domain-specific monitoring usually requires to losslessly distribute a dedicate domain-specific algorithm into WSNs, which is much different from most existing in-network processing works. This paper conducts a case study of a classic centralized SHM algorithm, i.e., eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), and shows how to losslessly and optimally in-network process ERA, especially the typical feature extraction method, i.e., that is singular value decomposition (SVD) therein, in a WSN. Based on whether the intermediate data can be processed together or not by sensor nodes, we respectively implement tree-based in-network processing of SVD and chain-based in-network processing of SVD in WSNs. We prove that using an appropriate shallow light tree as routes for tree-based in-network processing of SVD, can achieve the approximation ratio ${\text{1}}+\sqrt{2}$ (in terms of transmission cost), while for the chain-based in-network processing of SVD, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms for searching the optimal routes. Extensive simulation results validate the efficiency of these proposed schemes that are customized for SVD-based IOT applications.},   keywords={condition monitoring;feature extraction;Internet of Things;singular value decomposition;smart power grids;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks;domain-specific monitoring applications;structural health monitoring;smart grid monitoring;multihop wireless sensor networks;dedicate domain-specific algorithm;in-network process ERA;SVD;WSN;lossless in-network processing;Internet of Things;smart cities;civil structure;power grid;centralized SHM algorithm;eigensystem realization algorithm;feature extraction;singular value decomposition;tree-based in-network processing;chain-based in-network processing;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Sensors;Vibrations;Algorithm design and analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Informatics;In-network processing;matrix computation;routing scheme;wireless sensor network (WSN)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2017.2691586},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Oct},}

The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},   keywords={cryptography;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet;mobile computing;patient care;protocols;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;healthcare;elderly people;disable people;information and communication technologies;ICT;clinical process;Internet of things;context awareness;patient life;6LoWPAN network;RFID technology;NFC technology;secure communications;cryptographic SIM card;authentication;MIPv6 protocol;sensor networks;mobility;Internet;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Communications technology;Radiofrequency identification;Information security;Medical services;Senior citizens;Aging;Environmental management},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421661},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

However, wireless technology coexistence concerns are gaining increased attention. In response, coexistence test methods are now being reported in the literature, and novel solutions are considered in the American National Standards Institute C63.27 Standard for Evaluation of Wireless Coexistence. Furthermore, the IEEE 802 standards committee formed a new study group, named wireless automotive coexistence, operating under the umbrella of 802.19 working group to highlight the increasing concerns of wireless coexistence in the automotive domain. The radiated open environment coexistence test (ROECT) method offers high flexibility to test wireless devices for coexistence. Radio signal propagation during testing is over the air, reducing access to the signal path. Consequently, monitoring instantaneous device performance is a challenge yet to be addressed. This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the channel utilization of multiple, concurrent wireless transmitters sharing the 2.4-GHz ISM band in the context of ROECT. Passively received power measurements were collected during testing, and then a Gaussian mixture model was used to build a classifier for labeling observed power samples relative to their source. Case studies utilizing IEEE 802.11n as an interfering system with an under test system based on either IEEE 802.11n or ZigBee are detailed. Findings demonstrate the mutual effect of spectrum sharing on both interfering and under test systems in terms of per-second channel utilization and frame collision.

  year={2017},   volume={29},   number={12},   pages={2744-2757},   abstract={Recent progress in Internet of Things (IoT) platforms has allowed us to collect large amounts of sensing data. However, there are significant challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions for real-world applications. Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for predicting activities from sensor data.},   keywords={home automation;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;regression analysis;sensor fusion;sensor data;large-scale sensing data;activity prediction problem;imitation learning;simple regression learning problem;Internet of Things;learning activity predictors;mobile-device-based activity prompter;IoT platforms;smart home testbeds;Prediction algorithms;Smart homes;Training data;Feature extraction;Activity recognition;Environmental factors;Measurement;Activity prediction;smart environments;digital prompting;regression learning},   doi={10.1109/TKDE.2017.2750669},   ISSN={1041-4347},   month={Dec},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={205-210},   abstract={The future of ambient assisted living (AAL) especially eHealthcare almost depends on the smart objects that are part of the Internet of things (IoT). In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks;wireless mesh routing protocol;DoS attacks;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;Internet of things;wireless mesh network;denial of service attacks;data packet delivery ratio;Routing protocols;Routing;Computer crime;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;eHealthcare;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;health care;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;patient monitoring;pattern matching;real-time systems;signal classification;telemedicine;Web services;personalized healthcare;wearable systems;real-time ECG Classification;wearable biomedical devices;potential health hazards;timely medical treatment;modern wearable health monitoring devices;real-time analyses;ECG readings;arrhythmia classification;ECG waveforms;ECG equipment;machine learning phase;unique feature extraction method;prediction models;neuralnet fitting models;k-NN Classification models;misclassification error value;wearable devices;3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit;tele health analytical server;prediction tasks;trained classification models;ECG abnormalities;abnormal ECG events;Electronic Health Record;health care;cure institutions;Electrocardiography;Heart;Real-time systems;Databases;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Feature extraction;ECG classification;Wearable IoT;preventive health-care;real-time ECG;arrhythmia detection;arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB;Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;FHIR},   doi={10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has been considered and applied to model and demonstrate the flexibility and variability of the activities that involved in healthcare process. However, with the growing usage of digital information and IoT technology in the healthcare system, the issue of information security and privacy becomes the main concern in term of both store and management of electronic health record (EHR). Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place. BPMN is lacking of the ability to model and present security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a suitable way. This will increase the vulnerability of the system and make the future development of security for the system more difficult.

 title={Secure Healthcare Data Dissemination Using Vehicle Relay Networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In the recent years, vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs) can be an attractive choice for collecting and transferring the healthcare data of the passengers to the remote healthcare centers. In VANETs, some of the intermediate nodes may act as relay nodes in which case, these networks are called as vehicular relay networks (VRNs). However, the transmitted information in VRNs can be captured by intruders during transmission. Moreover, an attacker can launch selective forwarding, blackhole and sinkhole attacks in the network, which may in turn degrade the network performance parameters like high end-to-end delay, low packet delivery ratio and network throughput. Hence, to address these issues, a secure data dissemination scheme using VRNs is proposed. In the proposed scheme, firstly, a secure vehicular medical relay network system is designed for the users belonging to disconnected rural areas. The collected information is filtered at zonal levels before transmission to a nearby road side units (RSUs), which further pass it to the incoming vehicles. Secondly, a secure passenger health monitoring network is designed which continuously monitors health services of the passengers traveling in different vehicles. The information collected through small body sensors installed in the vehicles act as data sets that is forwarded to the on-board monitoring unit within the vehicle. This collected data is then transmitted to centralized healthcare centers for processing by using VRNs. Lastly, a strong Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based cryptographic solution is designed for secure communication among different vehicles. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in various network scenarios with respect to different selected parameters, such as throughput, network delay, packet delivery ratio, jitter, transmission and computation overheads, and key distribution overhead. The obtained results indicate that the proposed scheme provides improvement of 52% in average delay and 5% in packet delivery ratio. This further indicates effective message delivery even with high mobility of the vehicles.},   keywords={Medical services;Data dissemination;Monitoring;Relay networks (telecommunications);Cryptography;Electronic mail;Vehicular relay network;Healthcare;Data dissemination;ECC;Body sensor networks;Security.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2865008},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In particular, we show how Speaking Objects can exchange arguments in order to seek for information, negotiate over an issue, persuade others, deliberate actions, and so on, namely, striving to reach consensus about the state of affairs and their goals. In this context, we illustrate how argumentation naturally enables such a form of conversational coordination through practical examples and a case study scenario.},   keywords={Internet of Things;social aspects of automation;social networking (online);argumentation-based perspective;social interactions;smart objects;SIoT;coordination requirements;social IoT;speaking objects;Auditory system;Internet of Things;Performance evaluation;Cognition;Intelligent sensors;Actuators;Protocols;Argumentation;coordination;Internet of Things (IoT);social IoT (SIoT);Speaking Objects},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2775047},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

Unfortunately, IoT systems also present several important challenges to developers. This paper proposes a vision for how we may build IoT systems in the future by reconceiving IoT's fundamental unit of construction not as a "thing", but rather as a widely and finely distributed "microservice" already familiar to web service engineering circles. Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles. Our hope is that the vision of a microservices approach will help focus research that can fill in current gaps preventing more effective, interoperable, and secure IoT services and solutions in a wide variety of contexts.},   keywords={application program interfaces;authorisation;Internet of Things;Web services;secure microservice framework;Internet of Things;Web service engineering circles;microservice architectures;IoT systems;microservices;API gateways;service distribution;uniform service discovery;access control;personal health management;connected autonomous vehicles;Cloud computing;Access control;Containers;Medical services},   doi={10.1109/SOSE.2017.27},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

While some applications have already been developed to transmit the data from physical sensors to cloud environment, we propose to create and include virtual sensors, i.e. abstractions of physical sensors, in cloud that can enable on demand, pervasive, shared access to sensors. The definition and description of virtual sensors have already been presented in our earlier work. This paper presents implementation of virtual sensors at IaaS level. It provides a virtual sensor system architecture for both health and environment sensors and describes virtual sensor operations in four different stages.

If there was any damage found, using a mathematical model, damage size and location were determined. After analyzing the experimental data, error found in damage localization is 2.9% and error in determining damage size is 3.344%.

Current ENO approaches utilise techniques such as sample rate control, adaptive duty cycling and data reduction methods to balance energy generation, storage and consumption. However, the state of the art approaches makes a strong and unrealistic assumption that battery capacity is fixed throughout the deployment time of an application. This results in scenarios where ENO systems over allocate sensing tasks, therefore as battery capacity degrades it causes the system to no longer be energy neutral and then fail unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the problem to maximise the quality-of-service in terms of duty cycle and the battery capacity to extend the deployment lifetime of a sensing application. In addition, we develop a lightweight algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed method using real sensor energy consumption data captured from micro-climate sensors deployed in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London. Results show that a 307% extension of deployment lifetime can be achieved when compared to a traditional ENO solution without a reduction in the duty cycle of the sensor.},   keywords={Internet of Things;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;long term sensing;battery health adaptation;energy neutral operation;ENO;wireless sensor networks;environmental monitoring;hazard detection;industrial IoT applications;sample rate control;adaptive duty cycling;data reduction methods;battery capacity;energy neutral;quality-of-service;sensing application;real sensor energy consumption data;microclimate sensors;queen Elizabeth olympic park;London;Batteries;Degradation;Optimization;Sensors;Energy consumption;Energy harvesting;Wireless sensor networks;ENO;battery health;WSN;duty cycle adaptation;IoT;longevity},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2017.136},   ISSN={1063-6927},   month={June},}

In the age of industrial Internet of Things, a smart production unit can be perceived as a large connected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics that can relay data and communicate with each other. While, traditionally, the focus has been on machine health and predictive maintenance, the manufacturing industry has also started focusing on analyzing data from the entire production line. These applications bring a new set of analytics challenges. Unlike traditional data mining analysis, which consists of lean datasets (that is, datasets with few features), manufacturing has fat datasets. In addition, previous approaches to manufacturing analytics restricted themselves to small time periods of data. The latest advances in big data analytics allows researchers to do a deep dive into years of data. Bosch collects and utilizes all available information about its products to increase its understanding of complex linear and nonlinear relationships between parts, machines, and assembly lines. This helps in use cases such as the discovery of the root cause of internal defects. This article presents a case study and provides detail about challenges and approaches in data extraction, modeling, and visualization.},   keywords={Big Data;data analysis;data visualisation;Internet of Things;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;manufacturing analytics;industrial Internet of Things;smart production unit;manufacturing industry;Big Data analytics;Bosch;data extraction;data modeling;data visualization;Internet of Things;Big Data;Data mining;Predictive models;Logistics;Calibration;Manufacturing processes;big data;analytics;industrial Internet of Things;manufacturing;artificial intelligence},   doi={10.1109/MIS.2017.49},   ISSN={1541-1672},   month={May},}

We first develop a number of test suites to conduct our evaluation in four categories: confidentiality of data exchanged by IoT devices, integrity and authentication of their communication, their access control and availability, and their capability to reflect DDoS attacks. We then give each IoT device an overall rating (good, average, poor) based on threats we identified in each category.

A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32.

For example, a wearable system provides unobtrusive ambulatory, continuous, ubiquitous health measurement, and real-time solution for patients physical without hampering the natural movement of the wearer. However, the ability to measure one’s Automatic Nervous System (ANS) using wearable biosensors in healthcare applications has been limited due to several challenges related to a lack in wearability, accuracy, reliability and low-power consumption. In this paper, we presented a novel wearable ring sensor for the continuous measurement of four ANS activities: Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, skin temperature and locomotion. Detailed information is given regarding the development of the proposed ring sensor followed by a discussion of the evaluation that was done utilizing the wearable sensor on volunteers to gather data. Specifically, volunteers wore the ring sensor while being simultaneously monitored with real-time telemetry, the sensor values are processed and analyzed. This paper is a continuation and extension of earlier work by the authors. New validation, experimental results and development of the mobile application have been added to improve the previous system. The experiment demonstrated accurate results, and data were collected from 43 participants of diverse age, body mass, height, and race.

Are there any behaviors specific to each particular phase of viewing? Here, we propose a flexible and nonintrusive method based on the use of three categories of everyday connected objects (i.e. Smartphone, smartwatch and remote control). Data were collected during participants' interactions with a smart TV i.e. during three phases of viewing a TV program: before, during and after in an uncontrolled environment. A classification of these behaviors was done in order to identify the behaviors of viewers during each phase of TV-watching using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm, without prior pre-processing of the learning data. The results show that the viewers' behavior is very different from each other during the three phases. Thus, the behavior that was detected in two different phases did not have the same frequency of occurrence for all participants and was not performed by a given viewer with the same duration. In addition, the DNN algorithm gives a good average recognition performance of the three phases: 92.75%, 87.5% and 94% for the first second and third phase respectively. This study can help to better understand the viewers' behavior and anticipate certain actions in order to maintain their attention towards the proposed TV programs.},   keywords={behavioural sciences computing;digital television;Internet of Things;neural nets;TV program;TV-watching;Deep Neural Network algorithm;smart TV;viewers' TV-watching behaviors;IoT network;everyday connected objects;TV;Classification algorithms;Sensors;Training;Gyroscopes;Neural networks;Data mining;Iot;TV-viewing recognition;automatic classification;unconstrained environment [PATTERNRECOGNITION];Deep neural networks},   doi={10.1109/SMC.2017.8122886},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In recent years, more and more wearable senors have been employed in smart health applications. Wearable sensors not only can be used to collect valuable health-related data of their users, they can be also used in conjunction with other infrastructure-bound sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect sensor, to facilitate privacy-aware fine-grained activity tracking. This fusion of multi-modal data promises a new type of smart health applications that coach a user to live a healthier life style by monitoring the user in realtime and reminding him or her when he or she engages in an unhealthy activity. In this article, we investigate how to achieve fine-grained activity recognition in the context of such an application. In our scheme, the identification accuracy is improved by incorporating a nonlinear and local similarity measure, namely kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL), into a novel multilayer neural network (NN) learning algorithm, called as stacked extreme learning machine (S-ELM). Furthermore, to achieve a good generalization performance with minimal human intervention, Jaya as a popular optimization algorithm, is also used to adjust key parameters in our proposed approach. The experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},   keywords={Artificial neural networks;Training;Wearable sensors;Nonhomogeneous media;Intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;Smart health;action recognition;stacked extreme learning machine (S-ELM);kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL);Jaya.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2856241},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={7-12},   abstract={Wearable and connected health is a dominant field in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been widely used for enabling many connected health applications in diverse areas including: activity recognition, elder care, sports, and rehabilitation. Although the number of transistors in an integrated circuit follows Moore's law, it does not apply to batteries. Thus, in BSNs, the sensor node's compact size means it has a strict energy constraint. At the same time, body sensor nodes have sensing requirements that should provide an acceptable level of data fidelity in order to accurately infer the amount and type of activity. This paper investigates the energy challenges associated with combining MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and ball-tube motion detectors for BSNs. We examine multiple scenarios using these sensor types for body motion characterization. We then investigate the feasibility of these technologies along with collaborative sensing with the aim of reducing overall energy consumption. We conducted experiments examining sedentary (i.e. no movement) and non-sedentary activities. Our results show the possibility of 67 % reduction in energy consumption during the sedentary periods only, while maintaining the required level of data fidelity for inferring motion types.},   keywords={biomedical measurement;bioMEMS;body sensor networks;Internet of Things;motion measurement;fidelity-energy trade-off;wireless body sensor networks;wearable health;connected health;Internet of Things;IoT;activity recognition;elder care;sports;rehabilitation;Moore's law;data fidelity;MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units;ball-tube motion detectors;non-sedentary activities;Sensors;Energy consumption;Accelerometers;Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Wireless communication;Collaboration;Motion sensing;Data fidelity;Energy consumption;Accelerometer;Ball-tube;Collaborative sensing},   doi={10.1109/CHASE.2017.52},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={272-277},   abstract={Air pollution is an important issue due to its direct impact on human health. To cope with this problem, in urban areas a “monitor and react” approach, based on measurements provided use of static monitoring stations, is commonly adopted introducing constrains to the amount of areas that can be monitored within the city. With the rise of the Internet of Things paradigm, new air monitoring models based on mobile sensors networks have been proposed. In this paper, we present the concept of Bus as a Sensor (BaaS): an air quality monitoring system based on mobile sensor nodes placed upon buses. This work aims to provide a high resolution air quality map to report pollutants measurements and facilitate the analysis to support the government decisions in order to reduce the pollution. The proposed paper describes the system architecture and the requirements of sensor nodes to depict the implementation concepts and lay the foundations for future experiments on field.

As a resource constraint system providing critical health services, the EEG headset design must consider both high application fidelity and energy efficiency. However, through empirical studies with an off-the-shelf Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset, we uncover a mismatch between lossy EEG sensor communication and high neurometric application fidelity requirements. To tackle this problem, we study how to learn the sensitivity of neurometric application fidelity to EEG data. The learned sensitivity is used to develop two algorithms: 1) an energy minimization algorithm minimizing the energy usage in EEG sampling and networking while meeting applications' fidelity requirements and 2) a fidelity maximization algorithm maximizing the sum of all applications' fidelities through the incorporation and optimal utilization of a limited data buffer. The effectiveness of our proposed solutions is validated through trace-driven experiments.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;distributed sensors;electroencephalography;headphones;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;telemedicine;data sensitivity;neurometric fidelity;EEG sensing optimization;wireless neuroheadset electroencephalography neurometrics;ubiquitous physiological monitoring;human mental health;resource constraint system;critical health services;EEG headset design;energy efficiency;off-the-shelf Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset;lossy EEG sensor communication;high neurometric application fidelity sensitivity;energy minimization algorithm;EEG sampling;EEG networking;fidelity maximization algorithm;limited data buffer utilization;Electroencephalography;Wireless communication;Headphones;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Electrodes;Biomedical monitoring;Data sensitivity analysis;electroencephalography (EEG) sensors;energy efficiency;neurometric fidelity},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2322331},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Bluetooth;data compression;electrocardiography;entropy codes;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;radio transceivers;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;hybrid data compression scheme;power reduction;IoT wireless sensors;data transmission scheme;Internet-of-Things;hybrid transmission mode;adaptive data rate selection;wireless transmission;electrocardiogram;ECG;lossy compression technique;compression ratio;decompressed lossy data;entropy coding;lossless compression;Bluetooth transceiver;lossless transmission;healthcare applications;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Electrocardiography;Propagation losses;Hybrid power systems;Data compression;Hybrid compression;internet-of-things;lossless;lossy;wearable devices;wireless sensors;Algorithms;Data Compression;Databases, Factual;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wireless Technology},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2591923},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={April},}

The wireless transmission bandwidth limits the number of recording sites that can be monitored at one time. Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising approach that uses computationally efficient encoding to reduce the number of samples that are transmitted wirelessly, allowing more channels to be monitored over a transmission channel. The rakeness CS approach shows improved performance for higher compression rates, but in prior work it has only been evaluated for single channel data. We analyze the fidelity tradeoffs for compressed sensing implemented on a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system. We propose several methods for spatiotemporal encoding in rakeness CS and evaluate the performance using a spontaneous EEG dataset recorded during moderate movement. Reconstruction performance depends strongly on the compression ratio and weakly on the method of spatiotemporal encoding. This suggests weak spatial correlation between the different channels of EEG data, which were recorded in an experiment involving self-initiated movement.},   keywords={Correlation;Electroencephalography;Compressed sensing;Wireless communication;Monitoring;Encoding;Wireless sensor networks;EEG;hardware constraints;compressed sensing;rakeness},   doi={10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351863},   ISSN={2379-447X},   month={May},}

Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed-and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;wireless sensor networks;body area networks;BAN;secure data transmission;medical care;wireless link;cryptographic algorithms;one-time pads;memory technology;wireless sensor network;WSN;Encryption;Wireless sensor networks;Intelligent sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless sensors networks;Medical devices;Medical services;Computer security;Privacy;Body area networks;Security;Privacy;Encryption;Wireless Sensor Networks;Body Area Networks;One-Time Pad;Body area networks (BANs);encryption;one-time pad (OTP);privacy;security;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2378783},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

These systems are said to have real-time timeliness requirements since data communication must be conducted within predefined temporal bounds, whose unfulfillment may compromise the correct behavior of the system and cause economic losses or endanger human lives. The support of real-time communications over license-free bands in open environments is a challenging task since real-time medium access is only achieved by a strict timing control of all communicating stations (real and nonreal-time).

The framework covers five major components of the smart camera system with a set of designed test cases. The framework is applied to five commodity smart cameras. Range of vulnerabilities are discovered with respect to the framework. The vulnerabilities discovered indicate that IoT devices continue to be shipped by vendors without putting enough effort on their security and with insufficient regard for the implications that they have on users' privacy.

One critical IoT application pertains to m-Health services which allow monitoring the health status of patients while providing the ability for a rapid response in emergency cases. Connecting healthcare services to the IoT brings forward new security threats and vulnerabilities that can jeopardize the patients' private data. In this paper, a novel security framework for m-Health IoT security is proposed using the concept of moving target defense (MTD). MTD allows the m-Health system to dynamically change its cryptographic keys to increase uncertainty on an attacker and secure the data. In the proposed scheme, the devices update their keys locally to eliminate the risk of revealing new keys while they are being shared with a gateway. A practical implementation is proposed based on bitslicing LED, a lightweight encryption cipher, to improve the performance of decrypting multiple packets at the same time. LED bitsliced implementation was tested on an ARM Cortex-A53 and was shown to consume half of the processor's instructions compared to the conventional implementation. The effect of applying MTD on the number of processor's instructions is evaluated and shown to be bounded.},   keywords={cryptography;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Internet of Things;security threats;cybersecurity;m-Health IoT security;novel security framework;healthcare services;emergency cases;m-Health services;networked services;LED bitslice implementation;m-Health IoT systems;conventional implementation;LED bitsliced implementation;bitslicing;practical implementation;cryptographic keys;m-Health system;MTD;Encryption;Logic gates;Light emitting diodes;Performance evaluation;Internet},   doi={10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326298},   ISSN={2158-4001},   month={Jan},}

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={6},   pages={22-32},   abstract={Emerging availability (and varying complexity and types) of Internet of Things devices, along with the large data volumes that such devices (can potentially) generate, can have a significant impact on our lives, fueling the development of critical next-generation services and applications in a variety of application domains (e.g., health care, smart grids, finance, disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and water management). Deep learning technology, which has been used successfully in computer vision and language modeling, is finding application in new domains driven by the availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction that use deep learning technology to improve human health. However, timely and reliable transfer of large data streams (a requirement of deep learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralized locations, such as cloud datacenter environments, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including osmotic computing, have been proposed that promote distribution of data analysis tasks across cloud and edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge, and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. This Blue Skies piece analyzes the research challenges involved with developing a class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are resource and data aware and are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models, and data availability while executing-trading accuracy for execution time, etc.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer centres;data analysis;data models;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;data streams;cloud datacenter environments;osmotic computing;data analysis tasks;edge computing environments;mobile edge environments;holistic distributed deep learning algorithms;heterogeneous data models;data availability;critical next-generation services;Internet of Things devices;Blue Skies;Machine learning;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data models;Biological system modeling;Mobile communication;Distributed databases;deep learning;osmosis;holistic;cloud IoT;distributed},   doi={10.1109/MCC.2018.1081070},   ISSN={2325-6095},   month={November},}

 title={SBPG: Secure Better Portable Graphics for Trustworthy Media Communications in the IoT}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={5939-5953},   abstract={Smart Healthcare is envisioned as the combination of traditional healthcare augmented by smart bio-sensors, wearable devices, and a plethora of on-body sensors that communicate with smart hospitals, smart emergency response systems, and ambulances, through advanced information and communication technologies. The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. This paper addresses some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a secure digital camera integrated with the secure better portable graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this paper is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection, concurrent encryption and watermarking, which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management. The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: 1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image and 2) frequency-domain watermarking using blockwise DCT of size 8 × 8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant increase of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of our knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.},   keywords={cryptography;data compression;data privacy;discrete cosine transforms;emergency services;health care;image coding;image watermarking;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;trustworthy media communications;traditional healthcare;smart bio-sensors;on-body sensors;smart hospitals;smart emergency response systems;smart city;smart technology;information technology;IoT infrastructure;smart healthcare framework;hardware architecture;secure digital camera;patient data protection;SBPG architecture;privacy;compression technique BPG;compression quality;compressed file size;watermarking;compression processes;BPG compression;image authentication capability;secure portable graphics compression algorithm;image quality;secure communication;Medical services;Watermarking;Digital cameras;Image coding;Computer architecture;Smart healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);consumer electronics;secure digital camera;image communications;better portable graphics},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795478},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

It takes Taichi thoughts as its center and now becomes one of the traditional Chinese sports to keep in good health. Usually, it takes long time to learn Taichi Chuan and doesn't combine well with our daily life. Our paper introduces a imaginary Taichi suit in the future. The Taichi suit can real-time monitor your body signs and your surroundings. According to the relevant data, it can design a unique set of Taichi for you. Or it'll remind you and help you to avoid accidental collision with the outside world. Its mechanism is to use vary and several sensors inside and outside the suit. Inside sensors detect the wearer's heart rate, body temperature, respiration, movement fluency, and the corresponding conclusions such as the balance. According to the conclusions, users will exercise specific joints or parts of the body with the help of the suit to restore the body to health level. Outside sensors' function is to real-time monitor the wearer's surroundings and detect surrounding objects and their move speed to judge whether there's danger. Taichi suit stores each decomposition action of Taichi Chuan. It can intelligently select several actions and compose a set of movements suitable for the wearer to practice Taichi. There is a machine exoskeleton in the clothing material, which gives the wearer a certain external force to help the wearer move more accurately and conveniently to practice. Especially when several rapid motion objects appear to user, Taichi suit will warn the wearer. And at the same time, the exoskeleton will guide the wearer to avoid dangerous.

As these sensing systems are usually battery-powered and gas sensors are power-hungry, energy-efficient design and power management are required to extend the device's lifetime. In this paper, we present a two-stage concept where a novel low-power carbon nanotube is used as a gas detector for an energy-consuming metal-oxide (MOX) semiconductor gas sensor. We propose a design of a heterogeneous sensor node where we exploit the low-power nanotube gas sensor and the more accurate MOX sensor. This work performs energy consumption simulations for three event-driven scenarios to evaluate the power consumption reduction, as well as the limitations of carbon nanotubes. Our results show the benefits of the proposed approach over the scenarios with adaptive duty-cycling with only MOX gas sensors, proved with 20%-35% node lifetime prolongation.

A manager, on the other hand, performs some tasks including: (i) gathering signal from some an agent or sensor node, (ii) operated as a web server to make the data available online locally and globally for doctors in order that the data can be accessed anywhere with certain authorization schemes, (iii) it is equipped with ability to do data mirroring to a data center in the cloud system in such a way that the most updated file can be copied to the targeted location to ensure the authorized healthcare providers and doctors anywhere around the globe to get the latest heart sound data for cardiac monitoring and diagnosing. Some issues regarding future development of the IMedT system were presented including smart diagnosis capability, security issues, and extension to the 6LoPAN as well as its compliance to the emerging 5G mobile networks.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;phonocardiography;Internet of Medical Things;cardiac monitoring;5G mobile networks;medical care;health care;IoT deployment;phonocardiograph signal;PCG signal;data mirroring;IMedT system;smart diagnosis capability;security issues;Monitoring;Medical services;Heart;Phonocardiography;Bluetooth;5G mobile communication;Internet of Medical Things (IMedT);Internet of Things (IoT);cardiac monitoring;tele-auscultation;5G mobile networks},   doi={10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907420},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, it does not include wireless sensors and mobile phones which are needed to enable new emerging applications such as remote home medical monitoring. Therefore, a combined Cloud-Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provides scalable on-demand data storage and resilient computation power at the cloud side as well as anytime, anywhere health data monitoring at the IoT side. As both the privacy of personal medical data and flexible data access should be provided, the data in the Cloud are always encrypted and access control must be operated upon encrypted data together with being fine-grained to support diverse accessibility. Since a plain combination of encryption before access control is not robust and flexible, we propose a scheme with tailored design. The scheme makes use of cipher-policy attributes based encryption to empower robustness and flexibility. The scheme describes a general framework to solve the secure requirements, and leaves the flexibility of concrete constructions intentionally.},   keywords={cloud computing;cryptography;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;flexible access control scheme;cipher-policy attributes based encryption;personal medical data;on-demand data storage;cloud-Internet of things paradigm;cloud computing paradigm;remote mobile medical monitoring;cloud-IoT paradigm;Access control;Servers;Cloud computing;Sensors;Robustness;Encryption;Access Control;Internet of Things;Cloud Computing;Robust and Flexible Security},   doi={10.1109/RVSP.2015.38},   ISSN={2376-9807},   month={Nov},}

Also a critical issue of using D2D assisted cellular networks under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical equipments. In consideration of CTI and EMI, we study the problem of optimizing individual channel rates of the mobile users in different priorities (different levels of emergency) within the Internet of Vehicles for mobile health, and propose an algorithm of controlling the transmit power to solve the above-mentioned problem under a game-theoretical framework.

From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme.

So here the patient health condition or status i.e. Pulse rate, Respiratory rate, Body Temperature, Position of the body, Blood glucose, ECG and so on can be measured by utilizing the Non-invasive sensors. These sensors are associated with the Arduino Uno board, it gathers the information i.e. biomedical data from the sensors and the detected biomedical information can be transmitted to the server. The “Thingspeak” named new cloud is utilized here to place the detected information into the server. From this server the information can be envisioned to the specialists and other paramedical staff by Thingspeak android app. In this way by utilizing this Smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of specialists and paramedical staffs to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore lessens the time and cost of support.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;blood;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sugar;paramedical staff;IoT;patient health condition;Noninvasive sensors;detected biomedical information;Smart health monitoring system;smart home mechanization;savvy urban areas;smart environment;patient health monitoring system;health state;Arduino Uno board;Thingspeak android app;biomedical information;biomedical data;ECG;body position;blood glucose;time 24.0 hour;Temperature sensors;Heart beat;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Clouds;Internet of Things (IoT);Arduino Uno;Thingspeak},   doi={10.1109/I-SMAC.2017.8058240},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.},   keywords={image classification;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;principal component analysis;histopathological image classification;color pattern random binary hashing-based PCaNet;matrix-form classifier;computer-aided diagnosis;principal component analysis network;deep learning algorithm;feature learning;color norm pattern;angular pattern;color channels;multiple binary images;C-RBH-PCANet algorithm;Image color analysis;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Histograms;Algorithm design and analysis;Image classification;Color angular pattern;color histopathological image;color norm pattern;matrix-form classifier;PCANet;random binary hashing;Algorithms;Breast Neoplasms;Databases, Factual;Female;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Kidney Diseases;Machine Learning;Principal Component Analysis;ROC Curve},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2016.2602823},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a powerful tool for endowing computers with the capacity to process information about the affective states of users in human-machine interactions. Recent research has shown the effectiveness of graph embedding based subspace learning and extreme learning machine applied to SER, but there are still various drawbacks in these two techniques that limit their application. Regarding subspace learning, the change from linearity to nonlinearity is usually achieved through kernelisation, while extreme learning machines only take label information into consideration at the output layer. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper leverages extreme learning machine for dimensionality reduction and proposes a novel framework to combine spectral regression based subspace learning and extreme learning machine. The proposed framework contains three stages - data mapping, graph decomposition, and regression. At the data mapping stage, various mapping strategies provide different views of the samples. At the graph decomposition stage, specifically designed embedding graphs provide a possibility to better represent the structure of data, through generating virtual coordinates. Finally, at the regression stage, dimension-reduced mappings are achieved by connecting the virtual coordinates and data mapping.

 title={ADF: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Large-Scale PM2.5 Sensing Systems}, 
  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={2},   pages={559-570},   abstract={As the population density continues to grow in the urban settings, air quality is degrading and becoming a serious issue. Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is composed of four modules: 1) time-sliced anomaly detection (TSAD), which detects spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) real-time emission detection, which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) device ranking, which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) malfunction detection, which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.},   keywords={aerosols;air pollution;air quality;atmospheric techniques;anomaly detection framework;PM2.5 Sensing Systems;population density;urban settings;air quality;air pollution;fine particulate matter;low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems;international smart city projects;data quality;real-world environmental sensing systems;spatial spatio-temporal anomalies;real-time sensor measurement data stream;real-time emission detection;potential regional emission sources;sensing device;world measurement data;raw measurement data;large-scale environmental sensing systems;temporal spatio-temporal anomalies;AirBox project;device ranking;malfunction detection;Anomaly detection;Sensors;Monitoring;Atmospheric measurements;Smart cities;Pollution measurement;Anomaly detection;data analysis;PM2.5;smart city},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2766085},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

Technologies such as 5G, edge computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things realize smart healthcare that a client can have anytime, anywhere, and in real time. Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients.

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={6},   pages={2129-2141},   abstract={Wireless ad-hoc networks are becoming popular due to the emergence of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Due to the open wireless medium, secure routing functionality becomes important. However, the current solutions focus on a constrain set of network vulnerabilities and do not provide protection against newer attacks. In this paper, we propose SCOTRES-a trust-based system for secure routing in ad-hoc networks which advances the intelligence of network entities by applying five novel metrics. The energy metric considers the resource consumption of each node, imposing similar amount of collaboration, and increasing the lifetime of the network. The topology metric is aware of the nodes' positions and enhances load-balancing. The channel-health metric provides tolerance in periodic malfunctioning due to bad channel conditions and protects the network against jamming attacks. The reputation metric evaluates the cooperation of each participant for a specific network operation, detecting specialized attacks, while the trust metric estimates the overall compliance, safeguarding against combinatorial attacks. Theoretic analysis validates the security properties of the system. Performance and effectiveness are evaluated in the network simulator 2, integrating SCOTRES with the DSR routing protocol. Similar schemes are implemented using the same platform in order to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, SCOTRES is deployed on two typical embedded system platforms and applied on real CPSs for monitoring environmental parameters of a rural application on olive groves. As is evident from the above evaluations, the system provides the highest level of protection while retaining efficiency for real application deployments.},   keywords={ad hoc networks;computer network security;Internet of Things;jamming;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;combinatorial attacks;security properties;network simulator;DSR routing protocol;typical embedded system platforms;CPSs;wireless ad-hoc networks;Internet of Things;cyber-physical systems;open wireless medium;secure routing functionality;current solutions focus;constrain set;network vulnerabilities;newer attacks;SCOTRES-a trust;network entities;energy metric;resource consumption;topology metric;channel-health;jamming attacks;specific network operation;trust metric;Routing;Measurement;Ad hoc networks;Wireless communication;Jamming;Routing protocols;Communication system security;Cyber-physical system (CPS);Internet of Things (IoT);secure routing protocols;wireless sensor network (WSN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752801},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

  year={2015},   volume={3},   number={},   pages={493-498},   abstract={The work described in this paper consists of a temperature tracking system that follows a Client-Server architecture. A Raspberry Pi, a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) device, is responsible for sensing the temperature and streaming it to a server, the readings then are displayed in a mobile android application. For this system, a python application was developed to sense and stream the temperature, a servlet was developed to read and store the temperature in a SQLite database, and a mobile Android application was developed to read and display the temperature readings from the server. The initial versions of the project used the SoC device as a server (storing temperature readings into a local SQLite database), and both the SoC device and the mobile device needed to be connected in a local area network. However, the project was further developed to separate the server responsibilities from the SoC device. The system now supports user authentication, and both devices are connected through the Internet. This implementation allows the temperature readings to be viewed and displayed anytime from anywhere in the world since the database is hosted on a server which can be accessed over the internet. Also, this solution allows multiple SoC devices to stream temperatures to the server, to different mobile clients using the same database. The Android client application was also implemented to graphically show the temperature readings recorded by Raspberry Pi using Restful architecture. Moreover, an alert message notification was implemented in Android application so that a user is notified whenever the temperature reading reaches the preset threshold. On the other hand, the smart chair system has brilliant commercial prospects, which can be helpful to build health care products with the help of wearable sensors, intelligent refrigerator/oven temperature tracking system and etc.},   keywords={Android (operating system);client-server systems;Internet;Internet of Things;SQL;system-on-chip;temperature sensors;Internet of Things-based temperature tracking system;client-server architecture;Raspberry Pi;system-on-chip device;SoC device;mobile Android application;Python application;SQLite database;temperature sensing;local area network;user authentication;Restful architecture;smart chair system;health care products;wearable sensors;intelligent refrigerator;oven temperature tracking system;Temperature sensors;Androids;Humanoid robots;Servers;Web services;Temperature distribution;Databases;Raspberry Pi;Temperature Tracking;Python;Internet of Things;RESTful API},   doi={10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.261},   ISSN={0730-3157},   month={July},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1327-1336},   abstract={The rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds great promise to transform people's lives by making society more efficient in many areas, including energy, transportation, healthcare, commerce, manufacturing, etc. At their core, IoT devices use sensors to collect data on real-world physical processes and then transmit it over the Internet to cloud servers, which store, process, and learn from the data to better optimize these processes, either directly (by issuing remote commands that actuate IoT devices) or indirectly (by issuing notifications that direct users to take some action). Unfortunately, IoT devices also expose users to multiple new types of privacy attacks. In particular, the sensor data collected from IoT devices can indirectly reveal a variety of sensitive private information. In addition, users generally connect IoT devices to local networks, which they implicitly trust, with little understanding of what the IoT device is doing on the network. In this visionpaper, we discuss recent work on sensor data privacy in the context of smart energy systems to provide examples of i) the surprising types of private information we can glean from seemingly innocuous IoT data and ii) the different types of defenses we have developed to preserve IoT data privacy for smart energy systems. These defenses lie at different discrete points in the tradeoff between user privacy and IoT functionality, which motivates ongoing work on developing defenses that provide a more tunable tradeoff. We also discuss the privacy implications of connecting tens-to-hundreds of untrusted IoT devices to implicitly trusted local networks, and avenues for research to mitigate these concerns.},   keywords={cloud computing;data privacy;Internet;Internet of Things;untrusted IoT devices;IoT device;IoT data privacy;user privacy;IoT era;Internet-of-Things;cloud servers;privacy attacks;sensor data privacy;smart energy systems;Sensors;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Privacy;Privacy, Security, Internet of Things, Energy Systems, Smart Home, Smart Health},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00133},   ISSN={2575-8411},   month={July},}

In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.},   keywords={body area networks;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;health care;medical computing;message authentication;patient monitoring;cloud-assisted body area networks;cloud computing;healthcare industry;privacy concerns;cloud storage;healthcare service providers;dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme;forward privacy;periodically generated healthcare data;data owner assistance;world healthcare applications;security concerns;privacy-preserving e-healthcare system;security analysis;HSP;Bloom filter;message authentication code;Cloud computing;Servers;Medical services;Encryption;Reliability},   doi={10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056954},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care, especially for the respiratory diseases. However, while designing such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency, etc., to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different from the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps toward these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi. In order to satisfy the requirements of applications of personal medical care in WSNs and IoT, this study proposes an approximated ι<sub>0</sub>norm based method to search the solution via the gradient descent method, then projects the searched solution to the reconstruction feasible set.

In a conventional EMS, they have difficulties in obtaining causes of emergencies and personal medical histories, which are important for a rapid and proper response. We analyzed the requirement of a smart EMS (SEMS) system and derived the key components in connected care environments leveraging information and communication technology. A survey of paramedics (n=113) revealed that a SEMS system using IoT technology should integrate personal lifelogs, electronic medical records, and patient monitoring in ambulances into pre-hospital care recording systems. It also addressed context-awareness in the EMS accelerates first responder's activities, while supporting personalized care not only at the scene of the emergency but also during the entire hospital stay.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) is a practical cryptographic primitive for enforcing fine-grained attribute-based access control of personal health information (PHI) in mobile healthcare (mHealth) cloud. Existing schemes are either limited to restricted attribute universe or lack of efficient decryption algorithm for users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme for PHI in mHealth cloud. The proposed scheme simultaneously supports unbounded attribute universe and offers efficient decryption outsourcing approach without leaking the PHI privacy. It enables the PHI owner to define access policy in the form of any monotonic access structures. We prove the security in the standard model. Compared with relevant schemes, our scheme can reduce the user's decryption cost from increasing linearly with the number of attributes to constant.},   keywords={authorisation;cloud computing;cost reduction;cryptography;data privacy;health care;mobile computing;outsourcing;mHealth cloud;unbounded attribute universe;personal health information;mobile healthcare cloud;existing schemes;restricted attribute universe;efficient decryption algorithm;efficient decryption outsourcing approach;PHI privacy;PHI owner;access policy;monotonic access structures;relevant schemes;multiauthority attribute-based access control scheme;multiauthority attribute-based encryption;MA-ABE;practical cryptographic primitive;fine-grained attribute-based access control;user decryption cost reduction;Cloud computing;Outsourcing;Access control;Telecommunications;Encryption;MA-ABE;unbounded;decryption outsourcing;PHI;mHealth cloud},   doi={10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171106},   ISSN={2472-7628},   month={Oct},}

 title={Context-Aware Data Processing to Enhance Quality of Measurements in Wireless Health Systems: An Application to MET Calculation of Exergaming Actions}, 
  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={1},   pages={84-93},   abstract={Wireless health systems enable remote and continuous monitoring of individuals, with applications in elderly care support, chronic disease management, and preventive care. The underlying sensing platform provides constructs that consider the quality of information driven from the system and ensure the reliability/validity of the outcomes to support the decision-making processes. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate contextual information within the data processing flow in order to improve the quality of measurements. We focus on a pilot application that uses wearable motion sensors to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of exergaming movements. Exergames need to show energy expenditure values, often using accelerometer approximations applied to general activities. We focus on two contextual factors, namely “activity type” and “sensor location,” and demonstrate how these factors can be used to enhance the measured values, since allocating larger weights to more informative sensors can improve the final measurements. Further, designing regression models for each activity provides better results than any generalized model. Indeed, the averaged R2 value for the movements using simple sensor location improve from a general 0.71 to as high as 0.84 for an individual activity type. The different methods present a range of R2 value averages across activity type from 0.64 for sensor location to 0.89 for multidimensional regression, with an average game play MET value of 7.93. Finally, in a leaveone-subject-out cross validation, a mean absolute error of 2.231 METs is found when predicting the activity levels using the best models.},   keywords={biomedical communication;radio networks;context-aware data processing;wireless health systems;decision-making processes;metabolic equivalent of task;accelerometer approximations;simple sensor location;MET value;Intelligent sensors;Accelerometers;Biomedical monitoring;Approximation methods;Wearable computing;Internet of Things;Context modeling;Remote sensors;Wireless Health;Distributed Wearable Sensors;Context-Aware;Quality Metric;Physical Activity;Accelerometer;MET;Accelerometer;context-aware;distributed wearable sensors;metabolic equivalent of task (MET);physical activity;quality metric;wireless health},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2364407},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes.

In this space, challenges come from the needs to determine (1) contextual information such as location, duration of contact, density of devices, utilizing networked sensory information; (2) higher level knowledge such as users' activity detection, mood detection, applications usage pattern detection and user interactions on `mobile things', utilizing contextual information; and (3) adaptive and real-time parallel and distributed architectures that integrate context, activity, mood, usage patterns into mobile application services on mobile `things'.

Importantly, this emerging domain is driven by applications that leverage an IoT infrastructure to provide users with innovative, high-value services. IoT infrastructures range from small scale (e.g., homes and personal health) to large scale (e.g., cities and transportation systems). In this paper, we argue that there is a continuum between orchestrating connected entities in the small and in the large. We propose a unified approach to application development, which covers this spectrum. To do so, we examine the requirements for orchestrating connected entities and address them with domainspecific design concepts. We then show how to map these design concepts into dedicated programming patterns and runtime mechanisms. Our work revolves around domain-specific concepts and notations, integrated into a tool-based design methodology and dedicated to develop IoT applications.

For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative system based on Cloud Computing and Big Data technologies to integrate Smart City services into a large scale scenario. To do so, this system proposes a Big Data architecture based on Apache Spark libraries to provide data integration, storage, descriptive and predictive analysis. Also, the system provides a web interface application where users can visualize the data analysis results.

The conjunction of these medical devices with the radio communication chips and their internet connectivity exposes them to security and privacy risks. The insulin pump system is an autonomous, wearable external device, commonly used by diabetic patients to take insulin efficiently, as compared to manual injection through a syringe. Security attacks may disrupt the working of insulin pump system by delivering the lethal dose to patients and endanger their lives. In this paper, we ensure the correct dosing process of insulin pump system based on the combination of deep learning model and gestures performed by the patient. Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the thresh hold value of insulin based on last three months log of insulin pump system. If the amount of insulin to be injected by the insulin pump system is greater than our predicted thresh hold amount, then our system asks the patient to perform the gesture. After successful recognition of the patient's gesture, our solution compares the suspicious value of insulin with patient's gesture and identifies an attack.},   keywords={biomedical communication;biomedical equipment;biomedical telemetry;data privacy;diseases;gesture recognition;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient monitoring;patient treatment;recurrent neural nets;recurrent neural network;LSTM;long short-term memory;wearable external device;security attacks;medical devices;gesture recognition;deep learning;patient health monitoring;radio communication chips;insulin pump system;Insulin pumps;Insulin;Security;Recurrent neural networks;Machine learning;Sugar;Gesture recognition;Security;Deep Learning;Healthcare;Internet of Things;Network Attacks},   doi={10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00258},   ISSN={2324-9013},   month={Aug},}

This field meta model is used to optimize the antenna with no additional solver runs.

Data are streamed from multiple sources and is traversed through intermediate nodes until it arrives at sink node which performs decision-making for critical infrastructures. Malicious or compromised nodes may forge data or inject false data. Therefore, assuring high data trustworthiness is crucial for precise decision-making. Data provenance play an important role in evaluating the trustworthiness of data. However, provenance management for resource-constrained devices introduces several challenging requirements, such as network overhead, energy consumption, and efficient storage. In this paper, we formulate the problem of binding IoT with a provenance-aware system to enable it to track the data flow across the networked entities and data transformations applied to data by nodes. We propose a lightweight scheme to transmit provenance for IoT sensor data.

Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient's real-time data at fog layer.

The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={271-277},   abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources. In this paper we report on developments made to-date in various technical areas with respect to critical issues such as cost, power consumption, scalability, interoperability and privacy.},   keywords={ambient intelligence;assisted living;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;medical diagnostic computing;patient monitoring;multimodal sensor infrastructure;residential environment;ambient assisted living systems;sensor technologies;ageing society;diverse medical conditions;healthy habitants;medical conditions;activities-of-daily living recognition;ADL recognition;multimodal system architecture;AAL remote healthcare monitoring;multiple diverse sensor data sources;Sensors;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Logic gates;Cameras;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless communication;Ambient Intelligence;Ambient Assisted Living;eHealth;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247190},   ISSN={2164-7038},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Many countries are facing burdens on their health care systems due to ageing populations. A promising strategy to address the problem is to allow selected people to remain in their homes and be monitored using recent advances in wearable devices, saving in-hospital resources. With respect to heart monitoring, wearable devices to date have principally used optical techniques by shining light through the skin. However, these techniques are severely hampered by motion artifacts and are limited to heart rate detection. Further, these optical devices consume a large amount of power in order to receive a sufficient signal, resulting in the need for frequent battery recharging. To address these shortcomings we present a new wrist ECG wearable that is similar to the clinical approach for heart monitoring. Our device weighs less than 30 g, and is ultra low power, extending the battery lifetime to over a month to make the device more appropriate for in-home health care applications. The device uses two electrodes activated by the user to measure the voltage across the wrists. The electrodes are made from a flexible ink and can be painted on to the device casing, making it adaptable for different shapes and users. In this paper we show how the ECG sensor can be integrated into an existing IoT wearable and compare the device's accuracy against other common commercial devices.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;electrocardiography;health care;patient care;energy efficient heart rate sensing;health care systems;painted electrode ECG wearable devices;optical techniques;heart rate detection;battery recharging;wrist ECG wearable;heart monitoring;in-home health care applications;ECG sensor;IoT wearable;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Biomedical monitoring;Wrist;Monitoring;Heart rate;Body sensor networks;Low power sensors;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Heart rate variability},   doi={10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016260},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;Parkinson's disease management;wearable technologies;Internet-of-Things;IoT;diagnostics;self-assessment;objective device-assessment;patient experience;disease progression;physical deficits;intelligent algorithms;tablets;cell phones;medical database;lightweight wearable sensors;real-time motion metrics;laterally distributed platform;chronic neurological disorders;life expectancy;global healthcare system;Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors;Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies;Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

These factors affect vehicle drivers negatively as they contribute to stress, health problems, and wastefulness of time. This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets. A Bayesian Network is generated from the water level sensors and image processing data which provides possible reroute areas to avoid traffic congestion and flooded areas. All data are sent to a cloud platform through the Internet that can be accessed through a mobile user interface. This mobile user application provides information about the condition of the streets and possible reroute maps to users. The accuracy of the system is tested by actual implementation on a specific road. Results showed minimum accessing delay from using the ArRoad to navigate in rerouted paths to prevent impassable roads due to heavy traffic and flood. If effect, it lessens the amount of time experienced by drivers from heavy traffic condition and flooded streets which then improves the quality of life by preventing waste of resources such as time and money.},   keywords={belief networks;cloud computing;feature extraction;floods;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;wireless sensor networks;heavy vehicle traffic;flooded areas;unimproved road infrastructures;vehicle drivers;real-time image processing;water level sensor nodes;real-time video images;vehicle volume;Bayesian Network;water level sensors;image processing data;traffic congestion;rerouted paths;heavy traffic condition;flood monitoring;reroute system;Bayesian networks analysis;reroute areas;reroute maps;Sensors;Monitoring;Roads;Real-time systems;Cameras;Image sensors;Image processing;Bayesian Network;Image processing;Internet of Things;Machine learning;Sensors;Vehicle traffic},   doi={10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229368},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches. This paper further shows that the transmission of acceptable quality of ECG signals can significantly improve the battery lifetime of IoT-enabled devices.

IoT and advanced health sensors provide more convenience to patients and physicians. Where physicians can now wirelessly and automatically monitor patient's state. While these medical embedded devices provide a lot of new opportunities to improve the health care system, they also introduce a new set of security risks since they are connected to networks. More importantly, these devices are extremely hardware- and power-constrained, which in turn makes securing these devices more complex. Implementing complex malware detectors or anti-virus on these devices is either very costly or infeasible due to these limitations on power and resources. In this paper, we propose a new framework called SYNDROME for “externally” monitoring medical embedded devices. Our malware detector uses electromagnetic (EM) signals involuntary generated by the device as it executes a (medical) application in the absence of malware, and analyzes them to build a reference model. It then monitors the EM signals generated by the device during execution and reports an error if there is a statistically significant deviation from the reference model. To evaluate Syndrome, we use open-source software to implement a real-world medical device, called a Syringe Pump, on a variety of well-known embedded/IoT devices including Arduino Uno, FPGA Nios II soft-core, and two Linux IoT mini-computers: OlimexA13 and TS-7250. We also implement a control-flow hijack attack on SyringePump and use Syndrome to detect and stop the attack. Our experimental results show that using Syndrome, we can detect the attack for all the four devices with excellent accuracy (i.e. 0% false positive and 100% true positive) within few milliseconds after the attack starts.},   keywords={embedded systems;health care;Internet of Things;invasive software;medical computing;public domain software;SYNDROME;malware detector;Syndrome;real-world medical device;Linux IoT mini-computers;Spectral analysis;anomaly detection;medical IoT;internet-of-things;health-care solutions;wearable devices;connected medical devices;advanced health sensors;health care system;security risks;complex malware detectors;medical embedded devices;embedded/IoT devices;electromagnetic signals;open-source software;Syringe Pump;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Malware;Hardware;Medical diagnostic imaging;Clocks;Hardware Security;Malware Detection;Internet-of-Things;Embedded System},   doi={10.1109/HST.2018.8383884},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Though technology is advancing at a rapid rate but the question of an eco-friendly living remains unanswered. With growing population figures, the transportation requirement is increasing at a significant rate but the vehicular pollution arising from surface transport has serious health hazards besides polluting the nature. This paper proposes the design of a Pollution Monitoring Mobile System (PMMS) that can monitor vehicular pollution in real-time along with the information about the area being monitored. The prototype consists of a primary unit, a mobile robot that has a combination of Arduino and Raspberry Pi micro-controller boards simulating a zero-pollution mobile electric vehicle equipped with features such as obstacle avoidance, video surveillance and GPS tracking, and has an on-board local server. The secondary unit consists of a pollution monitor that collects several kinds of data such as temperature, sound level and different gas levels. The pollution monitor uses an Arduino micro-controller board and a combination of different sensors and a Wi-Fi module. The combined data from the primary unit and the secondary unit is sent to the local server. The data from the local server can then be logged/stored on a cloud service for detailed analysis of the data. The initial performance evaluation results are encouraging.

  year={2012},   volume={},   number={},   pages={9-16},   abstract={With the popularity of Internet of Things, the next logical step will focus on the application layer on top of network connectivity, especially Web of Things. While most of the existing efforts on Web of Things are focused on device mash up and data collection, in this paper a semantic web of things framework is proposed to leverage Semantic Web as the unified mechanism for monitoring, tasking, presentation, information flow and collaboration. Firstly, the requirements of human centric web of things application are described. Then the active linked data with data, task, context, computational organization, knowledge, presentation and interaction models is defined by extending the conventional linked data.

In this regard, systems that can provide proactive health related alert would be beneficial. e-Health and telemedicine offer powerful tools to improve efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services. The focus of this paper is to design a low cost, reliable e-Health monitoring device using IoT based platform architecture that can measure the vital health parameters of an individual, securely store the data in server and analyze the data for generating proactive alerts as applicable. The platform also connects the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patients' health data. Vital health parameters are measured using simple, non-restricting electrical sensors. The platform has outlier detection capabilities and is designed to send alerts to patients and their respective doctors in case any anomaly occurs. Thus, the proposed solution can be used to provide clinical healthcare at a distance, hence enabling the inclusion of elderly or homebound patients and those who are located in the remotest corners of the country within the realm of healthcare services.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;software architecture;telemedicine;e-health monitoring system;lifestyle related ailment;medical attention;proactive health related alert;telemedicine;healthcare services;IoT based platform architecture;patients health data;vital health parameters;clinical healthcare;Medical services;Temperature sensors;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Mobile communication;Bluetooth;Continuous Health Monitoring;Outlier Detection;Preemptive Medical Guidance},   doi={10.1109/ICRCICN.2015.7434248},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={233-239},   abstract={This research presents two approaches using microwave signals to detect vital signs of humans equipped with an m-health application. The first approach utilizes phase locked loop (PLL) to multiply the frequency of a very accurate Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS), generating a FMCW signal. The second approach multiplies the generated DDS signal using a frequency multiplier (F12). Counter-intuitive existence of low power harmonics (F13, F14, F11, F10, etc.) in the frequency multiplier added improvements in our tests. Tiny variations in environment are easily observed on specific bars in FFT of down-converted signals in the frequency multiplier approach. Both approaches work by sending a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) that reflects off objects present in the room. Based on the reflected signal, we calculate distances and movements, from which we then extract breathing and heart rates. In both approaches, we try two sets of microwave signals: Triangular FMCW and Sawtooth FMCW. Both approaches showed more obvious variation for body movement. In the case of the Triangular FMCW signal, interpreting data is more challenging. On the other hand, the Sawtooth FMCW signal resulted in clear output but lower power and harder to directly observe.},   keywords={direct digital synthesis;fast Fourier transforms;frequency modulation;medical signal detection;microwave measurement;patient monitoring;phase locked loops;pneumodynamics;down-converted signals;frequency multiplier approach;Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave;reflected signal;microwave signals;body movement;Triangular FMCW signal;Sawtooth FMCW signal;remote monitoring;vital signs;m-health application;phase locked loop;generated DDS signal;counter-intuitive existence;low power harmonics;Direct Digital Synthesizer;breathing;heart rates;Phase locked loops;Bandwidth;Biomedical monitoring;Time-frequency analysis;Radar;Heart rate;Vital sign monitoring;m-health;signal processing},   doi={10.1109/FiCloudW.2017.105},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={441-446},   abstract={As IoT (Internet-of-things) technologies grow rapidly for emerging applications such as smart living and health care, reducing power consumption in battery-based IoT devices becomes an important issue. An IoT device is a kind of real-time systems, of which power-savings have been widely studied in terms of processor's dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. However, recent research has shown that memory subsystems are getting reached to a significant portion of power consumption in such systems. In this paper, we show that power consumption of real-time systems can be further reduced by combining voltage/frequency scaling with task allocation in hybrid memory. If a task set is schedulable in a low voltage mode of a processor, we can expect that the task set will still be schedulable even with slow memory. By considering this, we adopt non-volatile memory technologies that consume less power than DRAM but provide relatively slow access latency. Our aim is to allocate tasks in non-volatile memory if it does not violate the deadline constraint of real-time tasks, thereby reducing the power consumption of the system further. To do so, we incorporate the memory allocation problem into the problem model of processor's voltage scaling, and evaluate the effectiveness of the combined approach.},   keywords={Internet of Things;power aware computing;processor scheduling;random-access storage;real-time systems;storage management;memory allocation;processor voltage scaling;energy-efficient IoT task scheduling;Internet-of-Things;power consumption reduction;battery-based IoT devices;real-time systems;power-savings;processor dynamic voltage-frequency scaling;memory subsystems;task allocation;hybrid memory;nonvolatile memory technologies;real-time task deadline constraint;Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change materials;Real-time systems;Power demand;Memory management;Magnetic tunneling;dynamic voltage scaling;hybrid memory;internet-of-things (IoT);non-volatile memory;real-time task scheduling},   doi={10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960033},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results.

In this context the timing notification depends both on the ability of the system to detect the invisible damages, using the information collected by several sensors correlated in time, and the delay in the transmission of such information from the building up to the authorities and rescuers offices.

In the Philippines, the transport sector specifically public utility vehicles (PUVs) dominantly contribute to the overall CO2 emission (CO2e) due to its engines' low efficiency. Moreover, the road grade and driving behavior such as the speed, and acceleration among these vehicles significantly affect the variability of its contribution to the overall CO2e. Thus, an Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system using onboard facilitative mobile sensor networks was installed in PUVs for wireless data collection to quantify the said variability of emission given some of its indicative variables. The collected data resulted in the difference in CO2e at around 33% between uphill roads and downhill roads, 16% to 27 % between downhill and flat roads, and 10% to 20% between flat and uphill roads. Moreover, the speeds around 40 km/h to 50 km/h have emitted lowest CO2 when compared to slower speeds. With this, CO2e of PUVs has clearly affected with the road grades and driving patterns.

In supply chain area, with the rapid growth of internet technologies, a lot of emerging technologies have been applied in traceability systems. However, to date, nearly all of these systems are centralized which are monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque that could result in the trust problem, such as fraud, corruption, tampering and falsifying information. Besides, centralized system is vulnerable to collapse, since a single point of breakdown will lead the whole system to be crashed. Today, a new technology called the blockchain which is a ground-breaking innovation in decentralized information technology presents a whole new approach. However, since this technology is still in its early stages, it has some inherent defects, in which scalability become a primary and urgent one when we face the mass data in the real world. In this paper we will build a food supply chain traceability system for real-time food tracing based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), blockchain and Internet of things, which could provide an information platform for all the supply chain members with openness, transparency, neutrality, reliability and security. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept BigchainDB to fill the gap in the decentralized systems at scale.

Typical recent medical applications include: (1) Information / Wireless power transfer: - Wearable or implantable vital data sensor / monitor - Wireless telemedicine / Mobile health system using IoT (Internet of Things) - Wireless capsule endoscopy (2) Diagnosis: - High intensity MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) - Microwave CT (Computed Tomography) for cancer detection - Wireless sleep monitor / ECG (electrocardiogram) monitor (3) Treatment: - Thermal therapy (hyperthermia, ablation, etc) - Wireless brain stimulator - Surgical device (coagulation device, microwave knife, etc) In this presentation, some practical medical applications of electromagnetic waves are introduced. Firstly, a wearable dual-mode antenna for vital data monitoring systems is presented. A key technology for the antenna is body-centric wireless communications. Secondly, an X-band antenna for a microwave sleep monitor is demonstrated with human-body phantom experiments. A “dynamic” phantom played an important role for the study. Thirdly, a coaxial-slot antenna and an array applicator composed of several coaxial-slot antennas for minimally invasive microwave thermal therapy are overviewed. A few results of actual clinical trials by use of coaxial-slot antennas are demonstrated from a technical point of view.

Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture.},   keywords={assisted living;Big Data;cloud computing;field programmable gate arrays;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;IoT;Big Data;unpredictable delays;safety concerns;flexible multilevel architecture;heterogeneous devices;location awareness;edge node;Field-Programmable Gate Array technology;FPGA node;minimal delay;minimal power consumption;assistive smart ambients;fog-computing architecture;preventive healthcare;pervasive connected devices;industrial applications;service providers;cloud computing;Internet of Things;cost reduction;active and assisted living;AAL;network collect data collection;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing;Medical services;Security;Sensors;Field programmable gate arrays;Cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/RTSI.2017.8065939},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

In this vision e-health applications are one of the most promising applications in IoT. However, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality constitutes the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme for an e-health application. This scheme allows both of sensors and the Base Station (BS) to authenticate each other in order to secure the collection of health-related data. Our scheme uses nonces and Keyed-Hash message authentication (HMAC) to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides authentication with less energy consumption, and it terminates with a session key agreement between each sensor and the Base Station. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that our scheme saves energy. In addition, it is resistant against different types of attacks.},   keywords={authorisation;Internet of Things;medical administrative data processing;lightweight authentication scheme;e-health applications;electronic health;Internet of Things;IoT context;keyed-hash message authentication;HMAC;data collection security;authentication exchange;session key agreement;base station;security analysis;Authentication;Sensors;Base stations;Internet of things;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Internet of Things;E-Health;Authentication;Identity;Session key agreement},   doi={10.1109/NGMAST.2015.31},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={6530-6539},   abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. Its process control is often referred to as embedded systems. Generally, CPS and Internet of Things have the same basic architecture, whereas the former shows a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements, i.e., wireless sensor networks can be a vital part of CPS applications. With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},   keywords={alarm systems;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;health care;medical computing;wireless sensor networks;medical cyber physical systems;process control;embedded systems;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;CPS applications;medical sensors;healthcare organization;Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter;healthcare environments;fuzzy logic;MFAFilter;fuzzy if-then rules;cyber-physical systems;false alarm reduction;Sensors;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks;Fuzzy logic;Industries;Computer science;Intrusion detection;False alarm reduction;fuzzy if-then rules;alarm filter;medical cyber-physical systems;wireless sensor networks;machine learning technique},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794685},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In this paper, we consider a three-tier hierarchical m-Health system: 1) the sensor network tier capturing vital signals; 2) the mobile computing network tier processing and routing the sensed data to a fixed remote location; and 3) the back-end network tier processing and analyzing the sensed medical data along with patient's medical history. Based on this architecture, a physical layer security scheme for the second tier is developed and network performance of the introduced scheme is analyzed under different metrics using stochastic geometry. To be specific, secure transmission range and average end-to-end delay are analyzed for two different strategies: the mobile device transmits: 1) to the nearest neighbor and 2) to the furthest neighbor. Furthermore, we consider the cases of full knowledge on eavesdroppers' locations and when such information is unavailable. Results show that transmitting to the nearest neighbor achieves the highest secure transmission distance with the lowest mean delay when full information on eavesdroppers is available.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;stochastic processes;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;sensor network tier;mobile computing network tier processing;fixed remote location;back-end network tier processing;sensed medical data;physical layer security scheme;mobile Health cyber-physical systems;biomedical sensors;m-Health server;three-tier hierarchical m-Health system;end-to-end delay;mobile device;stochastic geometry;Mobile handsets;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Wireless communication;Physical layer;Network security;Eavesdropping;end-to-end delay;mobile health (m-Health);physical layer security;secure transmission;stochastic geometry},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780263},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

Transmission of data contributes to a significant amount of power consumption by the transmitter and increase in the network traffic. In this paper we propose a low complex rule engine based health care data acquisition and smart transmission system architecture, which uses IEEE 802.15.4 standard for transferring data to the gateway. The power consumed and the network traffic generated by the device can be reduced by event based transmission rather than continuous transmission of data. We developed two different rule engines: static rule engine and adaptive rule engine, which decides whether to transmit the collected data based on the important features extracted from the data, thereby achieving power saving. In this paper, ECG data acquisition and transmission architecture is considered. The metrics used for performance analysis are the amount of power saving and reduction in network traffic. It is shown that the proposed rule engine gives a significant reduction in energy consumption and network traffic generated.},   keywords={body area networks;data acquisition;health care;Internet of Things;Zigbee;adaptive rule engine;IoT enabled remote health care data acquisition;smart transmission system;remote health care monitoring applications;biomedical sensors;power consumption;network traffic;IEEE 802.15.4 standard;data continuous transmission;static rule engine;Electrocardiography;Engines;Feature extraction;Transmitters;Data acquisition;Medical services;Monitoring;Adaptive rule engine;IEEE 802.15.4;data rate;energy consumption;ECG},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803168},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is part of this technology due to the deployment of multiple sensors such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) to collect vital body signals for processing and diagnosis. Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data. Generally, the presence of these problems in transmitting vital body signals may result in incorrect medical diagnosing which can increase mortality rate and cause severe impact to the overall system's performance.

However, the supply of energy to the sensors plays a key role in the success of these applications as well as the design and deployment of these networks. Currently, most WSNs are powered by batteries, which must be replaced frequently, increasing maintenance costs and operational complexity. In this paper, we propose a practical framework, called wirelessly energy-charged (WINCH), for battery maintenance; it involves recharging sensor batteries using mobile robots. This framework integrates a routing process in which the cluster heads are selected optimally, as in the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized protocol (LEACH-C), and the robots visit the sites frequently based on need and place themselves in the optimal positions with respect to the selected cluster heads. This approach considerably reduces overhead compared with existing methods. Moreover, we have developed an empirical model of the energy charging rate for sensor nodes. We use this model to compute the amount of energy harvested by each sensor in the proximity of the mobile charger. Simulation experiments for a wide range of design parameters and using several metrics, such as energy consumption, network throughput, and coverage, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with an existing work.},   keywords={battery storage plants;electrical maintenance;energy consumption;inductive power transmission;mobile robots;routing protocols;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;energy consumption;mobile charger;sensor nodes;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized protocol LEACH-C;cluster heads;routing process;mobile robots;sensor batteries;battery maintenance;WINCH;wirelessly energy-charged;operational complexity;maintenance costs;WSN;wireless energy transfer;wireless sensor networks;robot-assisted maintenance;Wireless sensor networks;Robot sensing systems;Batteries;Wireless communication;Mobile communication;Internet of Things (IoT);wireless sensor networks;smart grid;wireless energy transfer;energy harvesting;routing protocols},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2017.2709698},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={July},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been a focus for research in recent years. They enable data gathering across a wide range of domains and areas of interest from health service to environment monitoring, security, etc. Sensors are becoming cheaper, and as a result are being deployed in high density, at the same time; users' requirements of the network are changing frequently, they can even exceed the capabilities of the sensors in the network sometimes. The network is expected to operate for a long period of time with many nodes operating on batteries. These challenges have raised the attention to the problem of mission assignment in WSNs. Mission assignment aims at allocating tasks to specific sensors in the network -according to their capabilities-to answer users requirements while at the same time preserving the energy of the network. This paper approaches the problem of mission assignment from a geospatial perspective: because sensors' readings and data are associated with spatial properties of the sensors like their location and sensing range; spatial reasoning is an important aspect of mission assignment. However, spatial reasoning is still very limited in WSNs and has not received much attention because of the lack of standardized modelling of space. In the center of our approach an integration of two ontologies; the W3C semantic sensor network ontology (SSN) which describes sensor nodes in the network and GeoSPARQL (the OGC standard for modelling and reasoning about spatial data). We present Geospatial Sensor Mission Assignment algorithm (GeoSMA); a branch and bound algorithm based on the spatial functions and relations between tasks' and sensors' spatial properties.

Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers.

Although, much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the multisensor therapy (m-Therapy) framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.},   keywords={Big Data;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient treatment;social networking (online);medical institutions;ambient IoT sensors;ambient environmental data;m-Therapy monitoring system;multisensor framework;social networks;medical solutions;home use;multisensor therapy;ambient data;therapy exercises;in-home therapy management;social therapy of things perspective;social Internet of things;gesture-tracking sensors;m-therapy framework;Medical treatment;Sensors;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Servers;Gesture recognition sensors;range of motion;smart living;Social Internet of Things (SIoT)-based mobile therapy;therapy},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2776150},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

On the basis of the research on the application of IPv6 technology to the Internet of things (IoT), this paper proposes a kind of IPv6 proxy scheme for the interconnection between the IoT subnet and the IPv6 Internet.

Wearable technology, with its particular set of characteristics and application domains, has formed a rapidly growing sub-field of IoT, viz., Wearable Internet of Things (WIoT). While numerous wearable devices are available in the market today, security and privacy are key factors for wide adoption of WIoT. Wearable devices are resource constrained by nature with limited storage, power, and computation. A Cloud-Enabled IoT (CEIoT) architecture, a dominant paradigm currently shaping the industry and suggested by many researchers, needs to be adopted for WIoT. In this paper, we develop an access control framework for cloud-enabled WIoT (CEWIoT) based on the Access Control Oriented (ACO) architecture recently developed for CEIoT in general. We first enhance the ACO architecture from the perspective of WIoT by adding an Object Abstraction Layer, and then develop our framework based on interactions between different layers of this enhanced ACO architecture. We present a general classification and taxonomy of IoT devices, along with brief introduction to various application domains of IoT and WIoT. We then present a remote health and fitness monitoring use case to illustrate different access control aspects of our framework and outline its possible enforcement in a commercial CEIoT platform, viz., AWS IoT. Finally, we discuss the objectives of our access control framework and relevant open problems.},   keywords={authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;Internet of Things;mobile computing;software architecture;wearable computers;access control framework;pervasive concept;diverse concept;IoT space;WIoT;CEIoT;IoT devices;AWS IoT;wearable technology;wearable devices;cloud-enabled wearable Internet of Things;cloud-enabled IoT architecture;access control oriented architecture;ACO architecture;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Access control;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;IoT Devices;Wearable Devices;WIoT;Cloud Enabled;Access Control},   doi={10.1109/CIC.2017.00050},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={Analysis of multimodal data obtained from users of smart textiles designed for mental wellbeing}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Smart textile and wearable technologies will form an integral part of Internet of Things ecologies, including those implemented in mental health service environments. Smart textiles were developed and provided to users who were asked to discuss their feelings whilst holding/interacting with a smart textile during a walk. In the study discussed, respondents spoke aloud while using prototype handheld smart textiles with wireless capability, soft switches and accelerometers. Voice recordings were collected and transformed into verbal transcripts which were comparatively analysed to assess their validity for understanding individuals' emotional states in Internet of Things-enabled mental health service design. This paper reports on the talk aloud protocol, and the creation of a data analytics model for semantically analysing the transcripts in order to identify the `anxious' from the `not so anxious' participants. The model comprises of two main parts: Latent Semantic Analysis, for semantically analysing the transcripts; and the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm to naturally place the data into the two groups. The analysis revealed significant differences between the vocabulary used by the `anxious' and `not so anxious' participants. Finally, we demonstrate how the voice recorded data can help understand the patterns detected in accelerometer data collected from the smart textiles, using the data of one participant. This approach further provides an understanding of how smart textile objects can be utilised to communicate participant reactions to environments and situations as part of a Person-Centred approach to smart textile and service design development with mental health service providers.},   keywords={accelerometers;data analysis;health care;intelligent materials;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;psychology;textiles;vocabulary;multimodal data analysis;wearable technologies;Internet of Things;mental health service environments;prototype handheld smart textiles;wireless capability;soft switches;verbal transcripts;individual emotional states;mental health service design;latent semantic analysis;fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm;vocabulary;voice recordings;accelerometer data;Person-Centred approach;service design development;Textiles;Matrix decomposition;Accelerometers;Data models;Singular value decomposition;Semantics},   doi={10.1109/IoTGC.2017.8008974},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

Since traditional water quality monitoring system are inflexible to adapt sudden changes promptly at a long distance as well as its time consuming process and difficult task to get values of water parameter in real time operation. To overcome these key challenging issues a new system have been implemented for monitoring the contaminated water quality by adapting new technologies such as IoT(Internet of Things), WSN's(Wireless sensor network) and communication standards. IoT and WSN's have been grabbed attention towards it in all real time applications (Manufacturing system, Health care system and Industrial monitoring systems) for providing worldwide network to each interconnected objects for collecting data about physical things by using standard communication protocol. The performance analysis of the proposed systems is carried out by collecting water parameters data from different sensing elements (Turbidity, Density, Temperature and PH) at base station and comparing with its threshold value at the monitoring unit.

We undertake test simulations (technology trial without patient subjects) to demonstrate potential of long-range analysis, using a disposable test `key' and companion Android app to form a diagnostic platform suitable for remote point-of-care screening for urinary tract infection (UTI). The 868 MHz LoRaWAN-enabled personalized monitor demonstrated sound potential with UTI test results being correctly diagnosed and transmitted to a remote secure cloud server in every case. Tests ranged over distances of 1.1-6.0 Km with radio path losses from 119-141 dB. All tests conducted were correctly and robustly received at the base station and relayed to the secure server for inspection. The UTI test strips were visually inspected for correct diagnosis based on color change and verified as 100% accurate. Results from testing across a number of regions indicate that such an Internet of Things medical solution is a robust and simple way to deliver next generation community-based smart diagnostics and disease management to best benefit patients and clinical staff alike. This significant step can be applied to any type of home or region, particularly those lacking suitable mobile signals, broadband connections, or even landlines.

  year={2018},   volume={22},   number={6},   pages={1814-1823},   abstract={The integration of wireless sensor networks into Internet of things, led to a new generation of sensor nodes, directly connected to remote servers, for signal processing and decision making. The migration of data processing from the local node, achieved by decoupling the node hardware from the required processing capabilities, is only possible through implementation of network virtualization. The virtualization which brings new services that are executed remotely has led to security challenges, yet to be resolved, due to the increasing amount of data being continually exchanged between the sensor node hub and remote servers. In this regard, we introduce a novel genetic algorithm for data security with a powerful security architecture that performs one-time key, single block enciphering instead of a block chaining or weak stream enciphering. The algorithm architecture produces variable (stealthy) keys and data that adopt the white noise statistical behavior, therefore, having high immunity to cryptanalysis. The algorithm combines gene fusion and horizontal gene transfer inspired from the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. A salt extracted from the data block hash value adds the stealthy-key feature to the cipher. In fact, the avalanche effect for a block of encrypted sensors data of 16 × 16 B achieves an average of 98% with a single bit flipped in the data. An application in biomedical WSN/IoT with simulation and experimental results is presented.},   keywords={Wireless sensor networks;Ciphers;Genetics;Servers;Signal processing algorithms;Sensor informatics;cryptography;genetic algorithm;wireless body sensor networks;IoT},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2018.2860980},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases. Overall, this study can usefully promote the development of healthcare-strategy design and implementation.},   keywords={diseases;electronic health records;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;patient care;pattern clustering;high-cost cluster;healthcare-strategy design;cluster analysis;flattened electronic medical records;health systems;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;patient clusters;health care;LOS difference;facility utilization;Diseases;Hypertension;Diabetes;Heart;Clustering algorithms;Electronic medical records},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.49},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The proposed platform consists of a Pro-Trinket microcontroller, NRF transceiver module, Wi-Fi module, and Raspberry Pi. Two piezoelectric sensors are mounted on the structure to collect data continually. A proposed mathematical model is implemented on the Pro-Trinket to detect the health of the structure using the piezoelectric sensors output. If there is any damage, the Pro-Trinket will determine the damage location and size, and send this information to the Raspberry Pi using NRF transceiver. Raspberry Pi acts as a hub to collect the data from many such NRF transceivers located in different locations on the structure. The Raspberry Pi will upload the data to the cloud using a Wi-Fi module. The data will be stored in the cloud and can be checked remotely from any mobile device.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Smart Cities are a key application domain for the Internet of Things (IoT), and it is coming nearer everyday through pilot trials and deployments in various cities around the world. In Porto, Portugal, a city-wide IoT Living Lab emerged after we deployed several testbeds, e.g. harbour and a city-scale vehicular networks, and carried out various experiments with the SenseMyCity crowdsensor. In this paper, we discuss how a standard Machine-to-Machine (M2M) middleware is a key enabler of our e-health platform and SenseMyCity crowdsensor, powered by the use of smartphones as M2M gateways. M2M standards provided by ETSI/oneM2M are essential for a paradigm shift, aiming at making the IoT truly interoperable without the need for human intervention. In this work, we map two applications that rely on the role of a smartphone as a gateway, which acts as a proxy to connect legacy devices to the IoT using a standard middleware. We illustrate the advantages of using M2M, and, as a proof-of-concept, we measure and quantify the energy savings obtained, showing improvements of smartphones' battery life.},   keywords={Internet of Things;smart cities;smart phones;smartphones;M2M gateways;smart cities IoT applications;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine middleware;energy savings;Smart phones;Internet of things;Logic gates;Monitoring;Urban areas;Standards;Medical services;Battery life;crowdsensing;efficiency;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications;mobile gateways;smart cities},   doi={10.1109/ICT.2016.7500481},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

IoT systems are mainly comprised of embedded devices with limited computing capabilities while having a cloud component which processes the data and delivers it to the end-users. IoT devices access the user private data, thus requiring robust security solution which must address features like usability and scalability. In this paper we discuss about an IoT authentication service for smart-home devices using a smart-phone as security anchor, QR codes and attribute based cryptography (ABC). Regarding the fact that in an IoT ecosystem some of the IoT devices and the cloud components may be considered untrusted, we propose a privacy preserving attribute based access control protocol to handle the device authentication to the cloud service. For the smart-phone centric authentication to the cloud component, we employ the FIDO UAF protocol and we extend it, by adding an attributed based privacy preserving component.},   keywords={authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;home automation;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;smart phones;embedded devices;cloud component;user private data;robust security solution;IoT authentication service;smart-home devices;security anchor;privacy preserving attribute based access control protocol;device authentication;cloud service;smart-phone centric authentication;attributed based privacy preserving component;smart-phone based privacy-preserving security framework;IoT device access;Internet of Things;QR codes;attribute based cryptography';ABC;Authentication;Protocols;Cloud computing;Mobile handsets;Privacy;Home appliances;IoT authentication;QR-based authentication;FIDO;U-Prove;IoT attributes based authentication;IoT privacy-preserving},   doi={10.1109/ECAI.2017.8166453},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.},   keywords={health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;healthcare;patient confidence;HealthSense;peer to peer database;blockchain-Internet of Things model;bio-sensor;patient medical status;smart contract;inter planetary file system;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Contracts;Internet of Things;Biological system modeling;Conferences;BlockchInternet of Things;InterPlanetary File System;MQTT;Representational State Transfer},   doi={10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389459},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={An unobtrusive Wi-Fi system for human monitoring}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={219-223},   abstract={Human monitoring is important in a wide range of applications and, most notably, in health management. Within the Active and Assisted Living (AAL) framework, human monitoring techniques have particular relevance: among AAL purposes is that of applying ambient intelligence paradigm to enable older adults or people with specific demands to live longer and independently in their homes, reducing the need of institutionalization. Sensors are used to track some features of daily living activities, which are then processed to infer health-relevant information. When dealing with the home environment, cost, intrusiveness and ease of installation and management are of the utmost importance: wireless sensors are therefore often used, and cloud-based service can be exploited to reduce the need for home-based hardware devices, this matching the increasingly widespread Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Wireless sensor connectivity may rely upon different standards and protocols: most frequently, WSN (wireless sensor network) dedicated protocols are exploited (e.g. ZigBee, Z-Wave) taking advantage of optimization toward low data-rate, low power features. However, ad-hoc deployment of such networks is required, which may result in expensive and burdening installation and management tasks. In this paper, we present a complete Wi-Fi based solution (named CARDEA Wi-Fi), in which sensors specifically designed for human monitoring purposes are straightforwardly connected to the internet cloud by exploiting the Wi-Fi communication protocol (universally diffused for home connectivity), without the need of local gateway devices (except for a Wi-Fi modem router). This results in lightweight installation and management procedures, leading to a “plug and play” approach, which is particularly appealing when interacting with persons having low or no technical skill. The CARDEA Wi-Fi architecture is discussed, and the implementation of a set of “behavioral” sensors is described. Preliminary figures about performance are also given, with particular reference to battery lifetime.},   keywords={ambient intelligence;assisted living;biomedical communication;geriatrics;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;modems;patient monitoring;protocols;sensors;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee;ambient intelligence paradigm;daily living activities;health-relevant information;home environment;wireless sensors;cloud-based service;home-based hardware devices;WSN dedicated protocols;wireless sensor network;management tasks;human monitoring purposes;internet cloud;Wi-Fi communication protocol;home connectivity;Wi-Fi modem router;lightweight installation;management procedures;CARDEA Wi-Fi architecture;unobtrusive Wi-Fi system;health management;human monitoring techniques;Internet;standards;Wi-Fi based solution;WSN;Wireless fidelity;Monitoring;Batteries;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor systems;Wireless Sensors Network;Internet of Things;Wi-Fi;Home Automation;Ambient Intelligence;Human Activity Monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2017.8210632},   ISSN={2166-6822},   month={Sept},}

Exploitation of human resources should strictly be monitored on health aspects. The power generation sectors in view to increase the combustion quality for enhancing the power production contribute to green house gases which is a threat to human health. The prime aspiration is in detection, recognition and understanding of combustion conditions in power plants ensuring low Nitrogen Oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions for protecting the human health from hazardous gases. The colour information from the furnace flame images is the foundation for this scheme. The process of estimating the NO<sub>x</sub>emissions using a feed forward controller is implemented using Back propagation Algorithm (BPA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The challenge lies in identification of the 10 attributes used for training the ANN so as to estimate the NO<sub>x</sub>emissions. The estimation by ANN is termed as intelligent sensors embedded in the computing system to monitor using (IoT). This method proves to be indispensable because this IoT based online monitoring has reduced the percentage of emissions by 19% thereby increasing the combustion quality which has profound effect on human health.},   keywords={air pollution control;ant colony optimisation;backpropagation;combustion;computerised monitoring;feedforward;flames;furnaces;gas sensors;hazardous materials;image colour analysis;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;neural nets;power engineering computing;power plants;smart sensor technology;human resource;health aspects;power generation sectors;combustion quality;power production;green house gases;power plants;hazardous gases;human health protection;low nitrogen oxide emissions;colour information;furnace flame images;feed forward controller;back propagation algorithm;ant colony optimization;BPA;ACO;ANN;intelligent sensors;computing system;IoT based online monitoring;combustion condition understanding;combustion condition recognition;NO;Handheld computers;Data analysis;Soft Sensor;Ant Colony Optimization;combustion quality;NOx emissions;Feature extraction and Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8390155},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

 title={EnClass: Ensemble-Based Classification Model for Network Anomaly Detection in Massive Datasets}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={With an exponential increase in the Internet traffic over the network, there are growing concerns of identification of legitimate users which are the bulk sources of Internet traffic generation. However, due to the occurrence of anomalies in the network traffic, normal operations or the functionalities (traffic classification, resource allocation, and service management) of network get affected. Thus, in a given time frame, there is a requirement of anomalies detection in the network. The efficiency of any anomaly detection model mainly depends on the selection of relevant features and the learning algorithms which are used for classification of the network traffic patterns. However, due to curse of dimensionality, imbalance between classes, and variations in the types of anomalies, most of the existing solutions reported in the literature fail to deal with problems that occurs while detecting anomalies in large-scale network data. So, to remove these gaps in the existing solutions, we propose a new hybrid anomaly detection scheme called as Ensemble-based Classification Model for Network Anomaly Detection (EnClass) to detect anomalies in real- world networking datasets. EnClass has three modules as (i) Hoeffding-bound based clustering to identify the optimal subset of features to be taken for classification of network traffic (ii) Eigenvalues computation module to refine the features set for removal of unnecessary attributes and (iii) Very-fast decision tree for network traffic classification. In order to validate the proposed anomaly detection model, experimental evaluation is performed using real-world Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'99) dataset with respect to parameters such as-detection rate, false positive rate, and F-score. The comparison with existing approaches clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the EnClass in terms of detection rate (98.58%), false positive rate (0.42%), and F-score (96.06%).},   keywords={computer network security;data mining;decision trees;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;Ensemble-Based Classification Model;traffic classification;resource allocation;service management;learning algorithms;Hoeffding-bound based clustering;feature identification;very-fast decision tree;Eigenvalues computation module;F-score;large-scale network data;network traffic patterns;anomalies detection;Internet traffic generation;anomaly detection model;network traffic classification;real- world networking datasets;EnClass;Network Anomaly Detection;Classification Model;hybrid anomaly detection scheme;Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Decision trees;Microwave integrated circuits;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8255025},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Development of wireless sensor networking area has greatly increased the feasibility of a mobile e-health system since it provides wireless communication technology with promising sensor network applications. However, mobile e-health is subjected to a lot of security attacks such as sensor node cloning attack and man-in-the-middle attack. A secure e-health authentication system is one of the important approaches in order to provide high security for the whole e-health monitoring system. Considering the potential security attacks in mobile e-health application, a development of a unique identity of the e-health sensor node is proposed to provide a highly secure authentication protocol in mobile e-health. The identity of the e-health sensor node is a very important element in the proposed authentication protocol to ensure the confidentiality and the authenticity of transmitted e-health data.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cryptographic protocols;health care;Internet of Things;telecommunication security;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networking area;mobile e-health system;man-in-the-middle attack;secure e-health authentication system;e-health monitoring system;mobile e-health application;e-health sensor node;transmitted e-health data;EHEART passwordless authentication protocol;sensor network applications;security attacks;unique identity development;Internet of Things;wireless communication technology;sensor node cloning attack;secure authentication protocol;health care services;healthcare organization;Authentication;Mobile communication;Protocols;Servers;Medical services;Algorithm design and analysis;mobile e-health;unique identity;authentication;wireless sensor network},   doi={10.1109/LCN.2017.37},   ISSN={0742-1303},   month={Oct},}

 title={Statistical QoS Control of Network Coded Multipath Routing in Large Cognitive Machine-to-Machine Networks}, 
  year={2016},   volume={3},   number={4},   pages={619-627},   abstract={Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enables many applications such as smart grid, vehicular safety, and health care among many others. To achieve ubiquitous data transportation among objects and the surrounding environment, deploying spectrum sharing M2M communications with existing wireless networks is a must. A general large-scale cognitive M2M network (CM2MN), adopting cognitive radio technology, consists of multiradio systems, the primary system (PS), and secondary system(s) with tremendous cooperative cognitive machines, under heterogeneous wireless architecture. For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution, the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing in large CM2MNs.},   keywords={cognitive radio;cooperative communication;fading channels;MIMO communication;network coding;probability;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing;statistical QoS control;network coded multipath routing;cognitive machine-to-machine networks;smart grid;vehicular safety;health care;ubiquitous data transportation;spectrum sharing;wireless networks;cognitive radio technology;multiradio systems;primary system;secondary system;cooperative cognitive machines;heterogeneous wireless architecture;dynamic spectrum access;wireless fading links;flow control mechanisms;quality-of-service;multiple-input and multiple-output communications;probabilistic network coded routing algorithm;MIMO communications;spatial multiplexing;Quality of service;MIMO;Routing;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Delays;Network coding;Cognitive radio;cooperative relay;effective capacity;machine-to-machine (M2M) communications;network coded multipath routing;statistical quality-of-service (QoS) control},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478435},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={216-220},   abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},   keywords={assisted living;body sensor networks;cloud computing;gait analysis;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sensor fusion;multisensor IoT;assistive device;discrete gait monitoring;deployable gait monitoring;global healthcare system;chronic disease;wearable devices;particular impairments;mobility impairments;walkers;assistive technologies;unobtrusive activity monitoring;mobile device;multisensor fusion algorithm;health monitoring;gait cycles;hybrid sensorized canes;cloud storage;Monitoring;Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Instruments;Stability analysis;Aging;Sociology},   doi={10.1109/HIC.2017.8227623},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Blockchain is a novel technology, which has gained a lot of attention in the last years, mainly due to its use as a backbone for cryptocurrencies. The main purpose of blockchain technology is to provide anonymous transactions between participants, over a peer-to-peer network, using a decentralized distributed ledger. The goal of this novel approach is to eliminate any 3<sup>rd</sup>party validation and replace the trust of a central authority for transaction validation with cryptographic proof. While most applications of the blockchain revolve around cryptocurrencies, the blockchain can be used in many other fields, such as finance, distributed data storage, health and medicine, automation, etc. By creating an open, decentralized network, the blockchain can be used to develop decentralized applications and enable data access and sharing on a much higher level than the common implementations of client-server architectures which are in use today.

In this study, such an intelligent, unobtrusive conformable, user friendly physiological monitoring device is presented. In particular, the inkjet printing of silver nano-particle ink, NPS-JL from Harima Chemicals, is used to fabricate interconnections and a 2.4 GHz antenna on low-cost stretchable plastics. Interconnections between RF SoC and passive components are made with isotropic conductive adhesive.

Systems that offer AAL technologies make extensive use of personal data in order to provide services that are context-aware and personalized. This makes privacy preservation a very important issue especially since the users are not always aware of the privacy risks they could face. A lot of progress has been made in the deep learning field, however, there has been lack of research on privacy preservation of sensitive personal data with the use of deep learning. In this paper we focus on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder, which is a principal component of deep learning, and propose a new encoding technique that allows the creation of different AAL data views, depending on the access level of the end user and the information they require access to. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated with experiments on a simulated AAL dataset. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns privacy operations such as disclosure, deletion and generalization and can perform encoding and decoding of the data with almost perfect recovery.},   keywords={Privacy;Machine learning;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Decoding;Assisted living},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480247},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Planning the deployment of antennas in complex environments is a difficult task that requires the analysis of each specific scenario. In many cases, real measurements are taken so as to map signal strengths, interferences, and so on. However, taking real measurements is very time consuming and becomes impractical in complex, large scenarios. With the aim to avoid this burden, simulation techniques based on Ray Tracing, combining Geometric Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction, are used to predict waves' behaviour within a given environment. Those simulations depend on a number of parameters, namely angular resolution, number of rebounds, cells size, etc. By tuning these parameters, high-definition (HD) and low-definition (LD) results can be obtained. Although more practical than manual measurements, the computational cost of simulations in HD prevents their use in complex environments and their LD counterparts are applied. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) that allows the use of LD simulations (with low computational cost) by lessening their low quality problems. The proposed CF strategy exploits spacial constraints in 2D propagation planes to improve simulation results, which end up being very similar to those of HD, with a fraction of its computational cost.},   keywords={collaborative filtering;Internet of Things;medical computing;wireless channels;two-dimensional collaborative filtering approach;wireless channel characterization;medical complex scenarios;antennas deployment planning;signal strengths;simulation techniques;ray tracing;geometric optics;uniform theory-of-diffraction;wave behaviour;angular resolution;rebound number;cells size;high-definition results;low-definition results;complex environments;collaborative filtering;low-quality problems;2D propagation planes;IoT;Databases;High definition video;Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Computational efficiency;Filtering;Wireless Channel Characterization;Collaborative Filtering;Ray Launching;Smart Health},   doi={10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580801},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Specifically, we focus on the structure, functionality, and development process of MyDay, which is an IoT-based, multi-faceted self-management problem solving tool for pediatric T1D patients. By leveraging IoT technologies, MyDay can connect with various devices to integrate traditionally paper-documented physiological data (e.g., blood glucose values) in real-time with psychosocial and contextual data, such as mood, stress, and social activities. By integrating relevant-but heterogeneous-data sources, MyDay can create personalized feedback for self-awareness of factors associated with diabetes self-management patterns and promote data sharing and problem solving. Iterative user-centered design cycles were used throughout the development of MyDay to document and/or troubleshoot feasibility and technical stability, optimize feedback for effective health communication through data visualization, identify barriers to app use, optimize assessment, and evaluate capability of the app as a problem solving tool. Each iterative design round identified technical and design issues that were addressed in subsequent rounds by incorporating user input and expertise.

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={6},   pages={2009-2018},   abstract={This paper presents the design and prototype of a wireless health monitoring system using mobile phone accessories. We focus on measuring real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitoring using a smartphone case. With the increasing number of cardiac patients worldwide, this design can be used for early detection of heart diseases. Unlike most of the existing methods that use an optical sensor to monitor heart rate, our approach is to measure real-time ECG with dry electrodes placed on smartphone case. The collected ECG signal can be stored and analyzed in real time through a smartphone application for prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed hardware system consists of a single chip microcontroller (RFduino) embedded with Bluetooth low energy, hence miniaturizing the size and prolonging battery life. The system called “smart case” has been tested in a laboratory environment. We also designed a 3-D printed smartphone case to validate the feasibly of the system. The results demonstrated that the proposed system could be comparable to medical grade devices.},   keywords={Bluetooth;diseases;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;patient monitoring;smart phones;telemedicine;wireless health monitoring system;mobile phone accessories;real-time electrocardiogram;heart rate;heart diseases;smartphone application;hardware system;real-time ECG signal;3D printed smartphone case;single chip microcontroller;Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Heart rate;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Bluetooth;Bluetooth low energy (BLE);electrocardiogram (ECG);health;mobile;smart case},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2016.2645125},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

 title={Optimized Deep Learning for EEG Big Data and Seizure Prediction BCI via Internet of Things}, 
  year={2017},   volume={3},   number={4},   pages={392-404},   abstract={A brain-computer interface (BCI) for seizure prediction provides a means of controlling epilepsy in medically refractory patients whose site of epileptogenicity cannot be resected but yet can be defined sufficiently to be selectively influenced by strategically implanted electrodes. Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.},   keywords={Big Data;brain-computer interfaces;diseases;electroencephalography;feature extraction;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;principal component analysis;patient-specific BCI;ECoG clinical datasets;automatic computing;cloud-computing solution;independent component analysis;extended optimization approach;epileptic seizure prediction;BCI seizure prediction;deep learning;cloud computing;real-time processing;significant processing delays;electrode contacts;prediction task;manually extracted features;ictal patterns;electrographic ictal behavior;real-time solutions;medically refractory patients;brain-computer interface;seizure prediction BCI;EEG big data;optimized deep;Big Data;Electroencephalography;Cloud computing;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Electrodes;Brain-computer interfaces;Predictive models;BCI;EEG big data;cloud computing;deep learning;epilepsy;seizure prediction and localization},   doi={10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2769670},   ISSN={2332-7790},   month={Dec},}

The ubiquitous use of IoT ranges from Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to e-Health, e-Commerce, smart cities, supply chain management, smart cars, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and a lot more. Such reliance on IoT is resulting in a significant amount of data to be generated, collected, processed and analyzed. The big data analytics is no doubt beneficial for business development. However, at the same time, numerous threats to the availability and privacy of the user data, message and device integrity, the vulnerability of IoT devices to malware attacks and the risk of physical compromise of devices pose a significant danger to the sustenance of IoT. This paper thus endeavors to highlight most of the known threats at various layers of the IoT architecture with a focus on the anatomy of malware attacks. We present a detailed attack methodology adopted by some of the most successful malware attacks on IoT including ICS and CPS. We also deduce an attack strategy of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack through IoT botnet followed by requisite security measures. In the end, we propose a composite guideline for the development of an IoT security framework based on industry best practices and also highlight lessons learned, pitfalls and some open research challenges.},   keywords={Protocols;Internet of Things;Privacy;Malware;Tutorials;Computer crime;Threats to the IoT;Internet of Things;malware attacks on the Internet of Things;attack methodology;security and privacy;IoT security framework;security guidelines.},   doi={10.1109/COMST.2018.2874978},   ISSN={1553-877X},   month={},}

To date, many such solutions have focused on a single problem domain and require dedicated sensor and actuator infrastructure. This vertical integration makes the development of innovative, novel solutions costly and difficult to deploy. An architectural approach to addressing this challenge is to enable horizontal integration, where sensors and actuators from different applications can interconnect with any computational IoT application. In order to isolate complexities and to support heterogeneous systems and software, it is necessary to provide clear abstractions. We present such abstractions in the form of a layered protocol architecture that describes the necessary interfaces. Beyond technical challenges for horizontal integration, this paper also addresses network economic considerations since the various entities owning and operating sensors and actuators need suitable economic motivation to participate in such an approach.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={249-254},   abstract={In an mHealth remote patient monitoring scenario, usually control units/data aggregators receive data from the body area network (BAN) sensors then send it to the network or “cloud”. The control unit would have to transmit the measurement data to the home access point (AP) using WiFi for example, or directly to a cellular base station (BS), e.g., using the long-term evolution (LTE) technology, or both (e.g., using multi- homing to transmit over multiple radio access technologies (Multi-RATs). Fast encryption or physical layer security techniques are needed to secure the data. In fact, during normal conditions, monitoring data can be transmitted using best effort transmission. However, when real-time processing detects an emergency situation, the current monitoring data should be transmitted real-time to the appropriate medical personnel in emergency response teams. In this paper, a fast and secure approach for transmitting monitoring data over multi-RATs is proposed. The presented approach consists of benefiting of the presence of multi-RATs in order to exchange the secrecy information more efficiently while optimizing the transmission time.},   keywords={body area networks;cryptography;health care;Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;patient monitoring;radio access networks;telecommunication security;mHealth remote patient monitoring scenario;body area network sensors;home access point;multiple radio access technologies;physical layer security techniques;Long-term Evolution technology;IoT data;MultiRAT;fast encryption;Rats;Security;Data communication;Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Monitoring;Receivers;mHealth;multi-RAT;security;privacy;encryption;LTE},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450310},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

The framework is designed for auto connection of sensor nodes as soon as they are powered up and the central server is used for analyzing the incoming sensor data of (CEERIs) ammonia gas sensor. The data collection is made over a period of 4 months with identical gas exposure in two exposure cycle. Here, Raspberry pi3 board is used as a gateway that implements the IoT server and hotspot for device connectivity. Sensors study includes baseline and sensitivity drift, the relative change in response to gas exposure and hysteresis effect together. A correlation of above-mentioned sensor parameters depicts mutual relation and effect of sensor parameters on each other.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Energy efficient sensing is one of the main objectives in the design of networked embedded monitoring systems. However, existing approaches such as duty cycling and ambient energy harvesting face challenges in railway bridge health monitoring applications due to the unpredictability of train passages and insufficient ambient energy around bridges. This paper presents ECOVIBE (Eco-friendly Vibration), an on-demand sensing system that automatically turns on itself when a train passes on the bridge and adaptively powers itself off after finishing all tasks. After that, it goes into an inactive state with near-zero power dissipation. ECOVIBE achieves these by: Firstly, a novel, fully passive event detection circuit to continuously detect passing trains without consuming any energy. Secondly, combining train-induced vibration energy harvesting with a transistor-based load switch, a tiny amount of energy is sufficient to keep ECOVIBE active for a long time. Thirdly, a passive adaptive off control circuit is introduced to quickly switch off ECOVIBE. Also this circuit does not consume any energy during inactivity periods. We present the prototype implementation of the proposed system using commercially available components and evaluate its performance in real-world scenarios. Our results show that ECOVIBE is effective in railway bridge health monitoring applications.},   keywords={Sensors;Monitoring;Vibrations;Structural panels;Bridge circuits;Event detection;Internet of Things;structural health monitoring;on-demand sensing;vibration energy harvesting;smart transportation.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2867086},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Exploitation of human resources should strictly be monitored on health aspects.

The prime aspiration is in detection, recognition and understanding of combustion conditions in power plants ensuring low Nitrogen Oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions for protecting the human health from hazardous gases. The colour information from the furnace flame images is the foundation for this scheme. The process of estimating the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions using a feed forward controller is implemented using Back propagation Algorithm (BPA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The challenge lies in identification of the 10 attributes used for training the ANN so as to estimate the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. The estimation by ANN is termed as intelligent sensors embedded in the computing system to monitor using (IoT).

But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option.

However, most of these technologies are expensive, can only be used in laboratory environments, and examine only a few trials of each movement action. In this paper, we present a novel ambulatory motion analysis framework using wearable inertial sensors to accurately assess all of an athlete's activities in real training environment. We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.},   keywords={discrete wavelet transforms;gradient methods;medical signal processing;signal classification;sport;automatic activity classification;movement assessment;sports training session;motion analysis technologies;wearable inertial sensors;discrete wavelet transform;DWT;computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm;curve-shift registration technique;random forest classifier;Motion control;Medical devices;Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Accelerometers;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Injuries;Activity classification;Wearable inertial sensor;Technique assessment;Sensor fusion;Knee joint angle;Curve shift registration;Biomechanics;Smart and connected health;Activity classification;biomechanics;curve shift registration;knee joint angle;sensor fusion;smart and connected health;technique assessment;wearable inertial sensor},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2377238},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={582-589},   abstract={This manuscript reports on a work-in-progress project evolving aside from a main undertaking; that of making a commercial `Internet of Things' style product called “The Virtual Dressing Room (VDR)”. The project targets the process chain from designer and clothing manufacturer to retailer and end-user customers. The VDR has been subject of other publications, thus is introduced only briefly in this manuscript. VDR is a `non-groupware-based' project funded under the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation. A main goal at conception was reducing returns of online purchased apparel, which, at a reported approximately 40% is crippling the clothing industry. Results from public response surveys (including at The Scandinavian Health &amp; Rehab Messe) to a VDR simulation system clearly indicated how the wheelchair-bound community perceived benefits from the system. This was unexpected and aside from the original VDR project design requisite. Interviews highlighted problems of high street fitting rooms not being sized to accommodate wheelchairs, and often so minimally sized as to not enable a second helping person to be present to support the involved undressing and dressing procedures. Existing online purchasing systems were also considered problematic including a need to improve social networking to enable others Online to view clothes considered for purchase to assist decision making. The production suffered problematic cooperation, coordination, communication, and collaboration that prevented early product. This resulted in additional surveys and the evolution of this additional work-in-progress. Following introducing the VDR, key issues such as interface design, body measurement, and cloth representation in the VDR is discussed. The finding of wheelchair-bound-need is envisioned as a next-generation iteration and is thus the focus of this contribution to position the work-in-progress and invite like-minded interested parties to collaborate towards optimization of a system to realize potentials.},   keywords={Internet of Things;retail data processing;virtual reality;inclusive virtual dressing room;wheelchair-bound customers;Internet of Things;online purchased apparel;clothing industry;VDR simulation system;Clothing;Market research;Cameras;Avatars;Interviews;Companies;Industries;Cooperation;coordination;communication;collaboration;Virtual Environment;Collaborative System Generation;Human Computer Confluence;HCI},   doi={10.1109/CTS.2014.6867629},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

 title={Smart e-Health Gateway: Bringing intelligence to Internet-of-Things based ubiquitous healthcare systems}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={826-834},   abstract={There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system energy efficiency, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;data mining;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;telemedicine;smart e-health gateway;Internet-of-Things;ubiquitous healthcare systems;human health;IoT-based patient monitoring systems;smart homes;sensor network;sensor networks;constructive control;higher-level services;local storage;real-time local data processing;embedded data mining;UT-GATE;higher-level features;proof-of-concept design;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers;Context;Data integration;Hospitals;Internet of Things;Healthcare;Smart Hospital;Home care;Smart Gateway;Sensor Network},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158084},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications can be seen as network-controlled systems with a distributed architecture connecting many smart objects through the Internet. A typical IoT application aims to connect a set of nodes, capable of processing data and making decisions regarding the goal of the IoT application, with other nodes containing smart objects with robotic components to collect data from their environment. In this paper a generic model for novel context-aware and adaptive IoT architecture is presented. A group of nodes contains a Controller Interface (CI) that is used to control other nodes containing a Controller Unit (CU) which communicates randomly. CU nodes have complex control systems comprising both actuators and sensors, however CI nodes typically do not have detailed knowledge of such individual functionalities. Instead, at run time, Control Program Logic (CPL) is downloaded by the CI to facilitate control and communication. The system also allows for different CPLs for any particular CU. In such an open and adaptive IoT environment, an architecture is required that can provide sufficient flexibility in designing nodes while maintaining uniformity in the IoT system to allow for inter-operability and reliability. Using the notion of automata, a generalized mathematical description is presented that allows modelling of the CI and CU nodes and their operation. This model can then be used to formulate and solve problems regarding the interaction between CIs and CUs. The application of this model is demonstrated through a case study involving Remote Access Laboratories where the CI-CU model is used.},   keywords={Peer-to-peer computing;Copper;Adaptation models;Computer architecture;Sensors;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Internet-of-things;automata;microcontrollers;discrete-event systems;programming;IoT-actuation.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872117},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={281-285},   abstract={As the Internet of Things technology is developing rapidly, companies have an ability to observe the health of engine components and constructed systems through collecting signals from sensors. According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used. The output of the LSTM network is deciding the current life condition of components and offering the alerts for components before the end of their life. The proposed model also trained and tested on an open source data that is about an engine degradation simulation provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.},   keywords={costing;Internet of Things;Markov processes;optimisation;LSTM networks;engine condition;large scale data processing framework;Internet of Things technology;engine components;loT sensors;technological environment;maintenance cost;Markov chain models;survival analysis;optimization algorithms;LSTM model;Prognostics CoE;NASA Ames;Engines;Maintenance engineering;Temperature sensors;Fans;Sparks;Predictive models;ANN;predictive maintenance;LSTM;apache spark;big data},   doi={10.1109/ICEEE2.2017.7935834},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

In this paper, we present the first study on SmartBAN downlink delay and energy performances considering the emerging control/actuation applications in future e-health. A novel downlink transmission framework arising from our performance study is presented, which reduces the delay and energy consumption for downlink-dominated SmartBANs. In this paper, we first investigate the delay of the supplementary downlink mode (SDM) specified in the SmartBAN medium access control (MAC) protocol and propose an improved SDM (ISDM), showing that reordering the access periods in the SmartBAN MAC frame can effectively reduce the delay. To address the delay bottleneck in SDM and ISDM, we further propose limited-exhaustive (LEDM) and fully exhaustive (FEDM) downlink mechanisms. Then, based on SDM, ISDM, LEDM, and FEDM, energy-saving mechanisms in the SmartBAN downlink are discussed. Moreover, to critically evaluate the delay and energy-savings of LEDM and FEDM, we develop two embedded Markov chains that suit the SmartBAN beacon-enabled MAC. Finally, based on the above performances study, a novel downlink transmission framework that selects suitable transmission mechanism and access durations for delay-constraint SmartBAN applications is proposed. Extensive simulations show the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms and transmission framework.},   keywords={access protocols;body area networks;Markov processes;SmartBAN beacon-enabled MAC;energy consumption;smart body area network;ultralow power body area network;medium access control protocol;downlink transmission framework;Analytical model;downlink delay;energy-savings;smart body area network (SmartBAN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2836367},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={3},   pages={1936-1946},   abstract={Sustainable powering of wire-free sensors (WFSs) is a critical challenge in structure health monitoring for failure prevention applications, where battery replacement is practically difficult. Hence, it is of interest to develop means for remotely charging WFS devices using external power sources. In this paper, a novel stress wave-based optimization method is proposed for piezoelectric sensors wire-free charging. This method includes a novel waveform optimization scheme, a novel multiactuator, and a multichannel wire-free charging strategy to maximize energy transmission efficiency. Based on the measured channel characteristics of a tightly insulated environment, four different waveform design algorithms are implemented successfully to generate the optimized charging waveforms in accordance with the novel waveform optimization scheme. To testify the effectiveness of this novel optimized wire-free charging method, the piezoelectric sensor-based wire-free charging process is simulated. In the simulation process, a predefined waveform is applied in the piezoelectric actuator to generate a stress wave which is subsequently utilized to wire-free transfer energy to the piezoelectric sensors. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of multichannel wire-free charging in significantly reducing input power loss and enhancing energy transmission efficiency.},   keywords={condition monitoring;optimisation;piezoelectric actuators;piezoelectric transducers;radiofrequency power transmission;sensors;piezoelectric sensors wire-free charging;tightly insulated environment;wire-free sensors;stress wave;optimization method;multichannel wire-free charging strategy;optimized charging waveforms;novel optimized wire-free charging method;piezoelectric sensor;wire-free charging process;wire-free transfer energy;enhancing energy transmission efficiency;waveform optimization scheme;structure health monitoring;input power loss reduction;waveform design algorithms;piezoelectric actuator;Sensors;Stress;Metals;Batteries;Internet of Things;Optimization;Receivers;Acoustic energy transfer (AET);energy transmission;piezoelectric waveform design;wireless power transfer (WPT)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2817601},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-2},   abstract={In recent studies Machine Learning is regarded to be one of the disruptive technologies that will transform our future life, business and the global economy. In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs - and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation - are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed. This does not apply to computer science programs alone but also to other fields of study.},   keywords={computer science education;learning (artificial intelligence);technological forecasting;key enabling technology;Machine Learning applications;digitization;decision rules;computer science programs;Medical services;Security;Games;Computer science;Head;Magnetic heads;Education},   doi={10.1109/RoboMech.2017.8261102},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery.

  year={2018},   volume={12},   number={5},   pages={430-436},   abstract={Internet of things (IoT) systems are becoming ubiquitous and assuring their quality is fundamental. Unfortunately, a few proposals for testing these complex, and often safety-critical, systems are present in the literature. The authors propose an approach for acceptance testing of IoT systems adopting graphical user interfaces as a principal way of interaction. Acceptance testing is a type of black box testing based on test scenarios, i.e. sequences of steps/actions performed by the user or the system. In their approach, test scenarios are derived from a state machine that expresses the behaviour of the system under test, and test cases are derived from them by specifying the actual data and assertions and made executable by implementing the corresponding test scripts. As a case study, they selected a mobile health IoT system for diabetes management composed of local sensors/actuators, smartphones, and a remote cloud-based system. The effectiveness of the approach has been evaluated by measuring the capability of two test suites implemented using different localisation strategies (visual and structure-based) in detecting mutants of the original m-health system. Results show the effectiveness of the test suites implemented by following the proposed approach since 93% of the generated mutants have been detected.},   keywords={cloud computing;graphical user interfaces;Internet of Things;program testing;original m-health system;test suites;mobile health IoT system;corresponding test scripts;test cases;test scenarios;black box testing;graphical user interfaces;IoT systems;things systems;acceptance testing approach},   doi={10.1049/iet-sen.2017.0344},   ISSN={1751-8806},   month={},}

  year={2014},   volume={26},   number={2},   pages={145-168},   abstract={Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the users and the system, are demonstrated.},   keywords={systems and tools for interaction design;usability testing;novel interaction paradigms;ubiquitous and mobile devices;ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools;assistive technologies},   doi={10.1093/iwc/iwt030},   ISSN={0953-5438},   month={March},}

Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements.

When AAL applications are provided through the Internet, it is possible to create new applications involving the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The AAL-IoT applications can be used to event detection (such as fall detection or blood pressure) and send messages to an emergency service or a family member through the Internet. The event detection is frequently performed by sensor networks. However, these networks can present some difficulties to provide the high quality of service required for AAL-IoT applications. Thus, this paper proposes a new routing metric that considers information about the nodes and their connections, seeking the network performance enhancement for AAL-IoT. The proposed metric is an additive composition of information about link quality and nodes energy. The results obtained through simulation show that the proposed routing metric can increase the network performance to better meet the AAL-IoT requirements.},   keywords={assisted living;biomedical communication;geriatrics;Internet of Things;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks;routing metric;wireless sensor networks;ambient assisted living;Internet of Things;AAL-IoT;event detection;quality of service;Routing protocols;Measurement;Routing;Internet of things;Event detection;Ambient Assisted Living;Internet of Things;Routing Metrics;Wireless Sensor Networks},   doi={10.1109/WMNC.2016.7543985},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation. In this paper, we apply our modular approach for IoT applications - the context engine - to smart health problems, enabling the ability to grow with available data, use general-purpose machine learning, and reduce compute redundancy and complexity. For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment.

Suggesting useful things in IoT environment is a very important task for many applications such as urban computing, smart cities, health care, etc., and it needs to be widely investigated. The goal of recommendation systems is to produce a set of significant suggestions for a user with given characteristics. In this paper, a multi-agent algorithm that, by exploiting of a decentralized and self organizing strategy, builds a distributed recommendation system in IoT environment, is proposed. Things are represented through bit vectors, the thing descriptors, obtained through a locality preserving hash function that maps similar things into similar bit vectors. Cyber agents manage the thing descriptors and exchange them on the basis of ad-hoc probability functions. The outcome is the emergence of an organized overlay-network of cyber agents that allows to obtain an efficient things recommender system.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1169-1176},   abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks comprise tiny devices with limited processing power and tight energy restrictions. These limitations make it difficult to use established security mechanisms protecting the devices against malicious attacks. This holds particularly for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that help to detect various net-based attacks but often demand significant network and computing resources. In this article, we design and evaluate some IDS mechanisms for IoT Networks that are suited to small devices. They use a trust management mechanism that allows devices to manage reputation information about their neighbors. This mechanism makes it possible to single out maliciously behaving units in a processing and energy-friendly way. The approach is explained in the context of the healthcare domain.},   keywords={computer network security;health care;information management;Internet of Things;trusted computing;trust based distributed intrusion detection;Internet of Things networks;malicious attacks;net-based attacks;network resources;computing resources;IDS mechanisms;IoT networks;reputation information management;energy-friendly processing;maliciously behaving units;healthcare domain;Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Medical services;Routing;Routing protocols;Internet of Things;Security;Intrusion Detection},   doi={10.1109/AINA.2017.161},   ISSN={1550-445X},   month={March},}

The implementation of a smart objects-oriented IoT is a complex challenge as distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions and granularity need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. In this paper, we propose the integration of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: Agents and Cloud. Agent-based computing can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems. Cloud computing can enhance the IoT objects with high performance computing capabilities and huge storage resources. In particular, we introduce a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented IoT architecture that will be realized through ACOSO, an agent-oriented middleware for cooperating smart objects, and BodyCloud, a sensor-cloud infrastructure for large-scale sensor-based systems.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;middleware;multi-agent systems;object-oriented methods;open systems;software architecture;Internet of Things;smart object-oriented IoT;cyber-physical smart pervasive systems;application domains;health-care;transportation;logistics;smart grid;smart cities;heterogeneous IoT components;autonomous IoT components;distributed IoT components;complementary mainstream paradigms;large-scale distributed computing:;agent-based computing;open IoT systems;decentralized IoT systems;dynamic IoT systems;cooperating IoT systems;multiagent systems;cloud computing;high performance computing capabilities;storage resources;cloud-assisted IoT architecture;agent-oriented IoT architecture;ACOSO;agent-oriented middleware;BodyCloud;sensor-cloud infrastructure;large-scale sensor-based systems;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Intelligent sensors;Protocols;Internet of Things;Cooperating Smart Objects;Agent-oriented Computing;Cloud Computing;Middleware},   doi={10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846894},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

The realization effectively creates the Internet of Things paradigm, since all its components are directly connected to the Internet and each other thanks to global IPv6 addresses. The new IoT lighting system represents a “restoration of perception” project because the luminaries can be controlled in intensity and color temperature based on natural light and the desired rendering. In the initial phase, specifically designed sensors measure indoor lighting variations and this monitoring will be extended for a sufficient time to determine the proper control actions. Furthermore, besides adjusting the illuminance and color temperature for aesthetic and perceptual purposes, the system can also real-time monitor and control a variety of environmental parameters, fundamental for cultural heritage conservation, providing long-term studies of correlations between artificial light, natural light, and lighting performance, and also to evaluate over time the conservative aspects correlating them with any other critical environmental condition. The control of exposure to artificial light is also important in other contexts because light can interfere with biological processes controlled by endogenous circadian rhythms, with possible negative consequences for health results. Finally, this architectural solution can be extended to a complete Smart City system that integrates cultural heritage as one of the countless elements to be monitored and controlled in the city.},   keywords={Lighting;Cultural differences;Sensors;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Temperature measurement;Circadian rhythms;cultural heritage;Internet of Things;light of things;Smart Cities;wireless sensor network;LED lighting system},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2018.2858543},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={Sept},}

As we make these small autonomous devices intelligent, it is critical that we also give them a very advanced ability to assess and report their own health. Of course, on-board diagnostics are not a new concept. What is new with the Internet of Things is the extreme economic leverage that the on-board diagnostics will have due to the huge number of devices to be developed. If the on-board diagnostics perform poorly, the resulting surge of support costs could be enough to drive the organization deploying the Internet of Things systems out of business. As an organization gets ready to release millions of a certain type of Internet of Things device into the wild, how confident can the organization be that the on-board diagnostics will really perform as expected? As it turns out, we can learn from history. In the 1960s and 1970s the mainframe and telecommunications industries developed powerful statistical methods for answering this exact question for the large mission-critical systems that they were deploying.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={39442-39451},   abstract={With the development of information technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) has the characteristics of strong permeability, large use of action, and good comprehensive benefits. It promotes the development of the IoT technology in the detection of structural engineering. It is conducive to the development of intelligent, refined, and networked structures. Crack is the most common threat to the safety of bridges. Historical data show that the safety accidents caused by cracks account for more than 90% of the total bridge disasters. After a long period of engineering practice and rigorous theoretical analysis, it was found that 0.3 mm is the maximum allowable for bridge cracks. If the width exceeds the limit, the integrity of the bridge will be destroyed, and even a collapse accident will occur. Therefore, it is very important to identify cracks in bridge structure effectively and provide effective information for structural disaster reduction projects in time. Based on the structure of the IoT and the structural characteristics of the bridge engineering, this paper analyzed the practical application value of the IoT technology in the crack identification of bridge structures and established a bridge structure health monitoring system based on the IoT technology. On this basis, this paper also studied a digital and intelligent bridge crack detection method to improve the efficiency of bridge safety diagnosis and reduced the risk factor.

They have limited power supply, CPU capacity, memory, constrained bandwidth, throughput etc. However, these IoT devices can share the resources. Hence, they can be used in variety of applications like smart city, smart energy, and healthcare etc. Doctor-patient ratio in India is well below the global average. So, IoT can have profound effect on healthcare in India. Healthcare organizations must be prepared to play critical role in managing and analyzing huge volumes of data received from all health and fitness devices. In healthcare, several companies offer remote healthcare services through their platforms. However, most these platforms are proprietary. They can provide data and services to the specific devices and their proprietary servers. But these platforms cannot provide integration services, as they cannot communicate each other. They follow different standards or use different communication protocols. Management and interoperability of data is very important in healthcare. To identify issues in today's solutions and to improve the healthcare platforms this paper reviews different IoT platforms.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;IoT healthcare platforms;resource capacity;power supply;CPU capacity;IoT devices;smart city;smart energy;doctor-patient ratio;healthcare organizations;fitness devices;remote healthcare services;Internet-of-Things devices;communication protocols;Medical services;Protocols;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Security;Temperature sensors;IoT;Interoperability;Healthcare Platform},   doi={10.1109/I2C2.2017.8321898},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Major cities of the world measure and analyze air quality and pollutant concentration with the help of few static air quality monitoring stations. Roads are arteries of a city and used by majority of the population for commuting and transportation. A low cost air quality sensing system installed in a vehicle that commutes through different routes of the city gives a finegrained real time information about the state of pollutants and air quality in different parts of the city. In this work, we have developed an environment sensing, location aware, Internet of Things system to monitor, collect and analyze the presence of different environmental parameters in real time. Pollution route map of the routes traversed by the vehicle with sensor-setup has been created which can be accessed by mobile users in other vehicles.

Some services are running on the remote server, which can receive the samples, filter and analyze the ECG signals. The uploaded data will be pushed to a web portal, with which doctors provide treatments online. The system requirements, design and implementation of hardware and software are discussed respectively.

Specifically, the use of this kind of device in childhood games might help in the early detection of developmental problems in children. In this paper, we propose a method for the detection and classification of movements performed with an object, based on an acceleration signal. This method can automatically generate patterns associated with a given movement using a set of reference signals, analyze sequences of acceleration trends, and classify the sequences according to the previously established patterns. This method has been implemented, and a series of experiments has been carried out using the data from a sensor-embedded toy. For the validation of the obtained results, we have, in parallel, developed two other classification systems based on popular techniques, i.e., a similarity search based on Euclidean distances and machine-learning techniques, specifically a support vector machine model. When comparing the results of each method, we show that our proposed method achieves a higher number of successes and higher accuracy in the detection and classification of isolated movement signals as well as in sequences of movements.},   keywords={Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Performance evaluation;Acceleration;Toy manufacturing industry;Legged locomotion;Support vector machines;Activity recognition;classification algorithms;Internet of Things;pattern recognition;sensor systems and applications},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871732},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Designing and evaluating a smart cow monitoring system from a techno-economic perspective}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={Currently, precision dairy-monitoring technologies (PDMT) are gaining interest. These systems allow to monitor cow health, the time for insemination, and the birthing process. Doing so, they have the potential to reduce labor and management costs whilst increasing milk yield. Continuous innovations in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) have opened many new opportunities for monitoring animals and have been speeding up the development of PDMT systems. When designing an IoT-system, often various technological alternatives are available (e.g. communication technologies, types of sensors). Although this choice set can be narrowed down by mapping the functional and technical requirements on the technical specifications of the technologies, chances are that even after this step multiple alternatives are still feasible. In this work, we describe an IoT-system design methodology that also takes into account strategic and economic considerations. As a result, the choice set of feasible technologies can be limited to feasible alternatives that are also the most economic and strategic choices. In addition we describe how the total added value of such a PDMT can be quantified from the perspective of a dairy farmer. Applying this quantification methodology on the described PDMT system indicates an annual reduction of 250 EUR per cow for dairy management costs.},   keywords={agricultural engineering;agricultural safety;cost reduction;dairy products;dairying;design engineering;industrial economics;Internet of Things;sensors;smart cow monitoring system;techno-economic perspective;precision dairy-monitoring technologies;cow health;birthing process;milk yield;management cost reduction;Internet of Things-system design;insemination time;sensor type;Cows;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Economics;Diseases;techno-economic evaluation;smart cow monitoring technology;impact quantification;IoT in agriculture},   doi={10.1109/CTTE.2017.8260982},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

 title={Anomaly detection for Smart City applications over 5G low power wide area networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a whole new set of challenges and opportunities in Telecommunications. Traffic over wireless networks has been increasing exponentially since many sensors and everyday devices are being connected. Current networks must therefore adapt to and cope with the specific requirements introduced by IoT. One fundamental need of the next generation networked systems is to monitor IoT applications, especially those dealing with personal health monitoring or emergency response services, which have stringent latency requirements when dealing with malfunctions or unusual events. Traditional anomaly detection approaches are not suitable for delay-sensitive IoT applications since these approaches are significantly impacted by latency. With the advent of 5G networks and by exploiting the advantages of new paradigms, such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and edge computing, scalable, low-latency anomaly detection becomes feasible. In this paper, an anomaly detection solution for Smart City applications is presented, focusing on low-power Fog Computing solutions and evaluated within the scope of Antwerp's City of Things testbed. Based on a collected large dataset, the most appropriate Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies for our Smart City use case are investigated.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;distributed processing;smart cities;wide area networks;low-latency anomaly detection;anomaly detection solution;Smart City applications;Smart City use case;5G low power wide area networks;delay-sensitive IoT applications;Software-Defined Networking;edge computing;Anomaly detection;Sensors;Smart cities;Edge computing;5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Anomaly Detection;Smart Cities;IoT;5G;LPWAN;Fog Computing},   doi={10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406257},   ISSN={2374-9709},   month={April},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={96-101},   abstract={In-home IoT devices play a major role in healthcare systems as smart personal assistants. They usually come with a voice-enabled feature to add an extra level of usability and convenience to elderly, disabled people, and patients. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},   keywords={cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition;privacy-preserving voice-based search;mHealth data;in-home IoT devices;healthcare systems;smart personal assistants;voice-enabled feature;elderly;disabled people;patients;in-home healthcare applications;voice recording;voice upload;voice content;mood;tone;background sound;voice data privacy;speech recognition;homomorphic encryption;encrypted voice data;caregiver queries;voice feature similarity;Servers;Databases;Encryption;Data privacy;Medical services;Speech recognition},   doi={10.1109/CHASE.2017.66},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

 title={A Fog Based Middleware for Automated Compliance With OECD Privacy Principles in Internet of Healthcare Things}, 
  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={8418-8441},   abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;middleware;distributed data collection protocol;IoHT devices;intensive privacy preserving processes;privacy regulation frameworks;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;concealment process;holistic privacy middleware;personal gateways;sensitive health information;cloud-based healthcare services;accountability act;health insurance portability;personal health information;privacy laws;healthcare data;healthcare provider;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;living organism;healthcare Web services;hospital setting;personalized health insights;health data;healthcare delivery;Internet of Healthcare Things;healthcare things;OECD privacy principles;automated compliance;fog based middleware;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data privacy;Data models;Logic gates;Privacy;Internet of things;Patient monitoring;Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Implementation of open authentication protocol for IoT based application}, 
  year={2016},   volume={1},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Internet of Things is basically an interconnection of many smart devices which are deployed and connected to internet, serving people anytime and anywhere. There are many application domains that IoT technology can provide very useful services such as health care, transportation, infrastructure and home. Smart devices have limited efficiency in terms of computing storage and battery power. Due to the limited storage of embedded devices, it is difficult to implement strong authorization techniques. To overcome, this problem in the IoT, we have proposed a novel architecture for building a service using open authentication protocol where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system through the IoT device. Among the various authentication protocols available today, OAuth provides many leading organizations with a simple and secure way to authenticate users and permit them to access their protected data. OAuth provides client applications secure delegated access which is commonly used for Internet users to log in to third party websites using their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts without exposing their password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the user, giving the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. We are proposing a smart fire alarm system that notifies the user about the occurrence of fire in his house. User gets an alert message through his twitter and Gmail account simultaneously. Fire alarm system is built by integrating IoT technology with temperature detecting sensors. In order to use Gmail and twitter our device need to authenticate on behalf of the user. For this we use OAuth protocol for delegated access to applications like Gmail and twitter. Conventional end-to-end encryption based techniques are not accurate to ensure better quality of security because of exceeding slow response time of the smart devices, and has extremely low processing clock speed. The proposed work can offer very high level of security without compromising on the processing lack. Results shows that, device offers a low latency as compared to existing system having with 35 to 45 milliseconds for implementing the OAuthenticaion scheme.},   keywords={alarm systems;data protection;fires;Internet of Things;message authentication;open systems;protocols;social networking (online);software architecture;OAuth protocol;open authentication protocol;Internet of Things;IoT;service architecture;data privacy;data access;data protection;smart fire alarm system;Twitter;Gmail account;Authorization;Internet of things;open authentication (OAUTH) Protocol},   doi={10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823267},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations. In addition, a parallel random forest algorithm is developed using the MapReduce framework and then implemented on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Experimental results have shown that the random forest algorithm can generate very accurate predictions.

Uninterrupted operations &amp; business continuity are key requirements for any plant, for which power quality (PQ) play an extremely important role. Voltage sags are one of the most critical PQ disturbances in the grid, so that early detection and analysis are essential for improving the continuity of supply and enhancing the productivity in any automatized facility. An Internet of Things (IoT) solution that distributed monitors and controls this critical variable would be extremely beneficial for the management of the facility and thus ensures seamless business operations.

Based on such monitoring, anomalies and trends can be discovered, which possibly allows for early assessment of health issues and for prevention policies. However, when dealing with the home environment, and especially with older adults, obtrusiveness, usability, and cost concerns are of the utmost relevance. Smart objects can be designed to this purpose and deployed into the home: they usually feature low data rates and are customarily implemented by relying on conventional wireless sensor network approaches (ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc). This, however, results in “ad hoc” home networking, which is somehow obtrusive, complicated, and possibly expensive. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of behavioral sensors based on the familiar and ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology, suitable for a “plug-and-play” deployment. Sensors are connected to a cloud platform, embodying a genuine Internet of Things approach. With respect to conventional approaches, much better scalability, flexibility, and inexpensiveness can be attained. The main expected drawback comes from the higher power consumption, inherently needed to sustain much higher data rates. This paper focuses on such an issue, illustrating design techniques aimed at optimizing power consumption and battery lifetime. Performance results are shown, which definitely fall within a practical range and are fully comparable with more conventional approaches.},   keywords={ad hoc networks;assisted living;cloud computing;computerised monitoring;home networks;Internet of Things;radiotelemetry;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;unobtrusive monitoring;daily living activities;prevention policies;home environment;smart objects;low data rates;behavioral sensors;ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology;cloud platform;design techniques;IoT approach;AAL Wi-Fi;power consumption;data rates;wireless sensor network approaches;AAL Wi-Fi-based monitoring system;ad hoc home networking;plug-and-play deployment;Internet of Things approach;battery lifetime;active assisted living paradigm;Wireless fidelity;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Sensor systems;Assisted living;Wireless sensor networks;Smart homes;Active assisted living;continuous monitoring;Internet of Things (IoT);smart homes;Wi-Fi},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2017.2753458},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={Dec},}

These pipelines are often subject to failures like erosion, sabotage and theft, causing high financial, environmental and health risks. Therefore, detecting leakages, estimating its size and location is very important. Current pipeline monitoring systems needs to be more automated, efficient and accurate methods for continuous inspection/reporting about faults. For this purpose, several pattern recognition and data mining techniques have been brought into the research community. In light of the issues of low efficiency and high false alarm rates in traditional pipeline condition monitoring, in this paper, we have used negative pressure wave (NPW) coupled with intelligent machine learning techniques integrated in distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) to identify specific events beased on raw data gathered by individual sensor nodes. This collaborative approach reduces communication overhead to minimum by processing raw data on sensor nodes directly and reporting the detected events only. We apply the methods of support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in multi-dimensional feature space. The suggested technique is validated using a serial publication of experimentation on a field deployed test bed, with regard to performance of detection of leakages in pipelines.},   keywords={condition monitoring;data mining;Gaussian processes;leak detection;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;pattern recognition;pipelines;support vector machines;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor network;distributed event detection;oil pipelines;gas pipelines;water pipelines;pipeline monitoring system;pattern recognition;data mining technique;negative pressure wave;intelligent machine learning technique;distributed sensor network;support vector machine;K-nearest neighbor;Gaussian mixture model;multidimensional feature space;leakage detection;Pipelines;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Noise;Event detection;Wireless sensor network (WSN);Negative pressure wave (NPW);Support Vector Machine (SVM);Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM);K-nearest neighbor (KNN)},   doi={10.1109/iThings.2014.93},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2011},   volume={16},   number={2},   pages={199-218},   abstract={The Web in the Internet today—especially when it comes to the Internet of Things and cloud computing—is the Web of resources. A photo album, an appointment calendar, a telephone bill, a health record are all resource examples, listed here in the increasing order of expected privacy protection. A few properties of these resources define the roles of three major actors: The resources belong to their owner, they are hosted by the service provider, and they increasingly need to be shared (say, to support mash-up) with consumers. Owners authorize consumers' access to their resources, which providers then grant to the consumers upon authenticating them and checking for proper authorization. In the past, this was achieved by maintaining an access control list for each resource at the service provider. Typically, such a list specifies all consumers along with their privileges. Emerging trends in social networking and cloud computing require elasticity, or, in other words, the ability to grant resource access to new consumers on the fly. Naturally, this comes with ever-increasing requirements for privacy, which dictate strong authentication of all actors involved as well as cryptographic protection of the involved communication sessions. We share the industry expectation that the technology that solves the above problem will be a major enabler for applications based on technologies that range from social networking, to video-on-demand, to health care, to smart metering, and—especially—to cloud computing. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies, including the emerging Open Authorization Protocol (OAuth) 2.0, and presents our own solution in this space, which removes an intermediary and gives the owner of a resource immediate control over defining access to that resource.},   keywords={},   doi={10.1002/bltj.20511},   ISSN={1538-7305},   month={Sept},}

The expectations indicate that not only human will be connected but also devices and machines will be connected communicating altogether through the Mobile broadband technology. These tremendous improvements in telecom will introduce new and innovative services that touch every small detail of people's life. Consequently, telecom networks will become more complex, involve more resources, and demand more requirements. Thus, network optimization will be crucial to avoid wasting the resources and ensure service availability and network efficiency. To help achieving that, network operators require intelligent methods to understand the ongoing traffic and services characteristics in order to control and forecast the live/ongoing traffic.

While fulfilling these requirements under controlled conditions such as urban and indoor environments is relatively trivial, tackling the same obstacles in a more challenging and dynamic setting is significantly more complicated. In environments where infrastructure is sparse, such as rural or remote areas, specialized infrastructure-less ad-hoc solutions are needed, which provide long-range multi-hop connectivity to remote sensors and actuators.

Specifically, based on fast secure permutation and comparison technique, the encrypted user&amp;#x2019;s query is directly operated at the service provider without decryption, and the diagnosis result can only be decrypted by the user, meanwhile, the diagnosis model in service provider can also be protected.

We propose a prototype architecture that covers the cloud management layer and the operational features that manage data and Internet of Things devices.

Information and communication security is of utmost important as medical devices or sensors deployed to monitor and collect personal medical data are highly vulnerable to malicious hacker attacks. Moreover, compliance with industry standards and government regulations mandate security and privacy protection of health and medical information.

IoT systems continuously monitor the cyber physical and collect vast amount of data. Various analytics are developed to analyze IoT data and discover the business or societal values for their applications, e.g., home surveillance, smart readers, and location services. While we as a society greatly benefit from the utility of IoT data, an alarming concern of privacy breaching arises, i.e., data owners’ social and personal interests are revealed unknowingly. To address the conundrum of extracting utility from IoT data and protecting its privacy, the design of analytics is expected to jointly combine novel solutions in the security and machine learning fields. For example, encrypting generated data and enabling homographic computing can protect the data integrity; obfuscating data and disturbing the learning process with statistical noises are shown effective to guarantee the differential privacy. Moreover, due to the growing complexity and size of IoT systems, the implementation of analytical solutions needs to be scalable and adaptive to the streaming nature of IoT systems, i.e., data are continuously generated.},   keywords={Data privacy;Big Data;Internet of Things;Machine learning algorithms;Software algorithms;Machine learning},   doi={},   ISSN={2096-0654},   month={March},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={352-359},   abstract={Scarecrow is an avatar representation method that uses biological information to improve the immersive experience. Traditional computer games and virtual reality (VR) environments focus on operability and the immersive experience. Controller devices are used to communicate from the real world with the virtual world. The usability of control methods affect the immersive experience of the users. Recently, many of these VR environments have adopted motion sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect sensors) Motion sensors can measure the user's movements and gestures to input control parameters for the virtual world and a self-avatar. Motion sensor-based games can help users to become more active and take steps to advance their health. Biological information, such as heart rate, body temperature, and muscle fatigue change depending on exercise volume. In this paper, we use a real-time biological information feedback to synchronize the user and the avatar representation. For instance, the color of the avatar changes according to the skin temperature of the user's face. We hypothesize that this representation method will motivate user activities, and improve the immersive experience. We implement a Scarecrow prototype using a streaming server for measurements of the user's behaviors and a front-end exercise game. We also perform an early user study to report the user experience and discuss the effects of the proposed method.

In this approach, instead of providing products with after-sale services, the value proposition is mostly based on guaranteeing a trustable operation. As a result, capturing and analyzing information from a machine&amp;#x2019;s condition during its lifespan becomes an essential part of the smart PSS. Enabling this through lifecycle monitoring, sensing devices are at the core of smart PSS. Thus, the optimal configuration of PSS components is a critical step to ensure the efficiency of the solution. PSS design challenges arise because of the differences between characteristics and specifications of the embedded sensing system and the product. To fulfill this challenge, knowledge extraction and reuse from these domains is crucial during the design process. To do so, a sensor ontology is used as the backbone of the PSS knowledge-based framework. The focus of this paper is on defining the embedded sensing systems tailored to industrial PSS and the use of these systems in providing customized services. As part of the ICP4Life platform, the paper presents a sensing system ontology as a framework to support the smart services in industrial machinery PSS. An industrial use case is conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed ontology and to show the benefits of the ICP4Life platform to reduce time and cost of PSS development processes.},   keywords={Sensors;Monitoring;Ontologies;Collaboration;Internet of Things;Business;Computer architecture;Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);Machine Health Monitoring (MHM);Ontology-Based Framework;Product-Service System (PSS);Smart Sensing System.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2831279},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

The integration of Internet of things and Cloud manufacturing becomes increasingly important for the development of the industry 4.0. The objective of industry 4.0 is not just to improve the production management but also manage and reduce equipment downtime, for that many strategies could be implemented to ensure the good condition of equipment. The efficient one is the predictive maintenance which collects information from sensors and predicts the malfunction or failure in the system. Prognostics Health Manager (PHM) offers significant benefits for maintenance. It predicts the future behavior of a system as well as its remaining useful life. This paper offers a new architecture to provide PHM solutions as a service in cloud computing environment (PHM-SaaS, PHM-PaaS, PHM-IaaS). We defined the entities and actors as well as their behavior in this architecture. To test our approach we were interested by the prognostics and post-prognostics process which are the main steps in the PHM technology, the remaining useful life is estimated in the prognostics step and according to this RUL a decision is automatically provided by the post prognostics process.},   keywords={cloud computing;intelligent manufacturing systems;Internet of Things;maintenance engineering;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;production management;maintenance;PHS;prognostics health manager;production management;cloud manufacturing;Internet of things;industry 4.0;manufacturing industry;smart manufacturing;cloud computing;Prognostics and health management;Cloud computing;Manufacturing;Industries;Predictive maintenance;Computer architecture;Predictive maintenance;industry4.0;cloud computing;PHM as a Service;Prognostics and health management},   doi={10.1109/CIST.2016.7804958},   ISSN={2327-1884},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={40-45},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing in recent years with the improvements in several different applications in the military, marine, intelligent transportation, smart health, smart grid, smart home and smart city domains. Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56% accuracy than SVM with 88.71% and ANN with 90.02% accuracy.},   keywords={intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks;road traffic accidents;intelligent traffic accident detection system;microscopic vehicle variables;vehicular ad-hoc networks;traffic alerts;machine learning methods;supervised machine learning algorithms;random forest classifier;IoT;Intelligent Transportation Systems;traffic accident detection;VANETs;Accidents;Support vector machines;Artificial neural networks;Probes;Roads;Sensors;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Internet of Things (IoT);vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs);Accident Detection;Machine Learning;Artificial Neural Networks (ANN);Random Forests;Support Vector Machines (SVM);Traffic Simulation},   doi={10.1109/LT.2018.8368509},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

This kind of system allows medical professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) to verify continuously the health conditions of their patients.

Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care.

Unfortunately, this paper finds that Gope-Hwang scheme still has security pitfalls and limitations. This paper describes and cryptanalyzes the Gope-Hwang scheme to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security limitations.

Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated &amp; intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places.

At present, air pollution is mainly monitored with highly accurate equipment but at extremely low spatial resolution. Overcoming the disadvantage of the low spatial resolution, and building a wireless network of sensors, can open doors to new applications, both to better understand the sources and the health effects of air pollution. We review selected state-of-the-art projects to supply the reader with an overview over current applications that were enabled by the use of new sensors, wireless sensor networks (WSNWs) and information technology. We will critically asses the spatial and temporal resolution, the sensor accuracy and the results. We will show that the crucial step, that is still to be done, is the development of dependable sensors. This can enable the breakthrough of existing applications. By introducing intelligent nodes, the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) can trigger new use cases. We will conclude with an outlook on our future work, by presenting novel applications to better protect citizens from the adverse health effects of air pollution and to better understand those effects.

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={3},   pages={128-133},   abstract={Critical infrastructure monitoring is one of the most important applications of a smart city. The objective is to monitor the integrity of the structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) and detect and pinpoint the locations of possible events (e.g., damages, cracks). Regarding today's complex structures, collecting data using wireless sensor data over extensive vertical lengths creates enormous challenges. With a direct BS deployment, a big amount of data will accumulate to be relayed to the BS. As a result, traditional models and schemes developed for health monitoring are largely challenged by low-cost, quality-guaranteed, and real-time event monitoring. In this article, we propose BigReduce, a cloud based health monitoring application with an IoT framework that could cover most of the key infrastructures of a smart city under an umbrella and provide event monitoring. To reduce the burden of big data processing at the BS and enhance the quality of event detection, we integrate real-time data processing and intelligent decision making capabilities with BigReduce. Particularly, we provide two innovative schemes for health event monitoring so that an IoT sensor can use them locally; one is a big data reduction scheme, and the other is a decision making scheme. We believe that BigReduce will result in a remarkable performance in terms of data reduction, energy cost reduction, and the quality of monitoring.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;condition monitoring;critical infrastructures;data reduction;decision making;Internet of Things;public administration;smart cities;wireless sensor networks;smart city;critical infrastructure monitoring;complex structures;wireless sensor data;real-time event monitoring;BigReduce;cloud based health monitoring application;key infrastructures;big data processing;event detection;real-time data processing;intelligent decision making capabilities;health event monitoring;big data reduction scheme;decision making scheme;energy cost reduction;data collection;IoT framework;IoT sensor;monitoring quality;Monitoring;Big Data;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Smart cities},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700303},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={MARCH},}

This paper presents the first experimental validation of a novel personal exposimeter system based on a distributed measurement approach to achieve higher measurement quality and lower measurement variability than the commonly used single point measurement approach of existing exposimeters. An important feature of the system is the integration of inertial sensors in order to determine activity and posture during exposure measurements. The system is designed to assess exposure to frequencies within the 389 to 464, 779 to 928 and 2400 to 2483.5 MHz bands using only two transceivers per node. In this study, the 2400 to 2483.5 MHz band is validated. Every node provides antenna diversity for the different bands in order to achieve higher sensitivity at these frequencies. Two AAA batteries power each standalone node and as such determine the node hardware size of this proof of concept (53 mm×25 mm×15 mm), making it smaller than any other commercially available exposimeter.},   keywords={biological effects of fields;body sensor networks;patient monitoring;radio transceivers;UHF antennas;wireless fidelity electromagnetic field exposure monitoring;wearable body sensor networks;Internet of Things;radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure;health effects;personal exposimeter system;distributed measurement approach;inertial sensors;posture;exposure measurements;transceivers;antenna diversity;AAA batteries;node hardware size;frequency 389 MHz to 464 MHz;frequency 779 MHz to 928 MHz;frequency 2400 MHz to 2483.5 MHz;Biomedical measurement;Sensors;Antenna measurements;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Batteries;Radio frequency;Body sensor networks;dosimetry;electromagnetic fields;electromagnetic measurements;gait recognition;microelectromechanical systems;patch antennas;sensor fusion;telemetry;wireless sensor networks;Biosensing Techniques;Electromagnetic Fields;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Monitoring;Humans;Telemetry;Wireless Technology},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2487264},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={June},}

Thus, designing efficient transceivers is crucial to reduce transmission delay and energy through leveraging data reduction techniques. In this context, we propose an efficient data-specific transceiver design that leverages the inherent characteristics of the generated data at the physical layer to reduce transmitted data size without significant overheads. The goal is to adaptively reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted in order to efficiently communicate and possibly store information, while maintaining the required application Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.

In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},   keywords={3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;3G-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;WiFi-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;ubiquitous real-time monitoring;data logging;sensor nodes;temperature data;ECG signals;Internet-of-Things functionality;serial-line-Internet-protocol;UbuntuOne;remote U-healthcare monitoring;3G connectivity;4G connectivity;Electrocardiography;Temperature sensors;Medical services;Servers;Clouds;Real-time systems;Internet},   doi={10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783258},   ISSN={1558-2531},   month={Feb},}

The ability of plants to detoxify these compounds makes biological systems the promising technologies for this purpose. Although precise mechanisms how plants remove VOC are unknown and current knowledge is based on experiments conducted under controlled conditions, it does not prevent us not to use biological air purifiers. Our measurements under uncontrolled conditions in environments where people live, showed that houseplants' ability to reduce VOC differs from one to another environment.

What most people perceive of its structure often lacks acknowledgement of the smallest parts of it, albeit as of recently the most used ones, namely smartphones and smartwatches. Being recognized as a prominent member of the wearable/ubiquitous computing family, smartwatches have been gaining in popularity proving themselves valuable in various contexts, ranging from providing fitness applications and general health monitoring, to always-on assistive technology for people with special needs. This paper focuses on an alternative approach to using smartwatches, considering them monitoring tools for system and network administrators able to provide fast and readily available information on various network equipment and services. For this purpose a proof-of-concept application suite was built, used to provide the status of important services on a remote Linux-based server, as well as the status of the server system itself. We show how smartwatches can offer different, and some unique, previously considered impractical ways to convey information. Supporting HCI aspects are specifically discussed, with respect to the Pebble smartwatch basic I/O capabilities limited to four hardware buttons and 1.26" monochromatic display.},   keywords={computerised monitoring;file servers;input-output programs;Internet of Things;Linux;mobile computing;wearable computers;remote server monitoring device;interaction design;computer ecosystem;Internet of things paradigm;smartphones;wearable-ubiquitous computing family;fitness applications;general health monitoring;always-on assistive technology;network administrators;network equipment;proof-of-concept application suite;remote Linux-based server;NCI aspects;Pebble smartwatch basic IO capabilities;hardware buttons;monochromatic display;Servers;Androids;Humanoid robots;Monitoring;Operating systems;Presses;Smart phones},   doi={10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160336},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Among the various energy harvesting techniques, vibrational piezoelectric energy harvesters have several advantages compare to other solutions (e.g. high output density power, high output voltage). One of the main constraints in the exploitation of such a technology is the limited bandwidth of the devices, intrinsic to the mechanical resonator typically used. In this contribution, different resonators based on a cantilever-like structure are studied both by FEM simulation and by measurements of physical samples.

In IoT@Work we focus on the potential of making manufacturing environments more agile and flexible. We explain how the IoT-centric architecture for manufacturing also needs a deep understanding of the manufacturing system and its state today.

In order to understand technological, and clinical context the proposed framework of this study is a synthesis of UTAUT, and HBM theories respectively, finally trust and doctor-patient relation factors are used to measure individual and patients' perspective about IoT-based health care systems. The proposed framework is validated with a pilot study of 40 respondents from five thickly populated cities of Pakistan. The findings verified that the proposed framework is appropriate to implement with empirical data. Based on the confirmation of the most familiar both theories, in health framework, this study demonstrates Perceived Health Risk which is composed of two independent factors, Perceived Susceptibility (PSS) and Perceived Severity (PS) have a significantly positive effect on cues to action. While in a technological context, Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC) have a jointly significant positive effect on cues to action to use behavior. Furthermore, both trust and doctor-patient relationship have also a positive effect on cues to action to use behavior. The instrument questionnaire adopted cluster sampling, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to validate and test the hypotheses. The findings may be used and generalized to other similar population as a theoretical basis to improve the health care services of developing countries like Pakistan.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;sampling methods;healthcare acceptance;Pakistan;doctor-patient relationship;IoT-based health services framework;HBM theories;doctor-patient relation factors;health care systems;health framework;Perceived Health Risk;Perceived Susceptibility;Perceived Severity;health care services;Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model;structural equation modeling;Health Belief Model;Internet of Things;Hospitals;Technological innovation;Urban areas;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging;Internet of Things;UTAUT;HBM;Smart Healthcare;Perceived Health Risk;Cues to action},   doi={10.1109/ICETSS.2017.8324135},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={89-94},   abstract={In this paper, we present a novel design of an Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine based health monitoring system-The Smart Chair. Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities. The results presented show that the proposed system is definitely a low cost affordable solution for IoT based telemedicine system, as compared to existing systems.},   keywords={Android (operating system);Bluetooth;electronic messaging;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;patient monitoring;public domain software;telemedicine;wireless LAN;remote doctor;design phase;low cost affordable solution;IoT based telemedicine system;low cost smart chair;IoT based health monitoring;open source technology;human body;physiological signals;health parameters;Internet of Things;physiological parameters;telemedicine based health monitoring system;The Smart Chair;raw signal processing;secured Web server;Wi-Fi module;remote location;Android application;Bluetooth;text file;Email;MMS;SMS;healthcare facilities;Microcontrollers;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Hardware;Temperature sensors;Heart rate;Remote Monitoring;Healthcare;Internet of Things;Telemedicine;Arduino;Android;Thingspeak},   doi={10.1109/ICIINFS.2016.8262913},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration. Based on the type of data transmission; proactive or reactive, these devices will process and provide the data for the health monitoring company to take the correct action when patient's state of health moves outside normal range.

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2884-2895},   abstract={The recent proliferation of mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearable devices has given rise to crowdsourcing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients, and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure three-factor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card; 2) password; and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely accepted real-or-random model and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. With the combination of high security and appreciably low communication and computational overheads, our scheme is very much practical for battery limited devices for the healthcare applications as compared to other existing related schemes.},   keywords={authorisation;biometrics (access control);cryptographic protocols;formal verification;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;message authentication;mobile computing;public key cryptography;smart cards;battery limited devices;healthcare applications;chaotic map-based anonymous user authentication scheme;user biometrics;fuzzy extractor;Internet of Things applications;remote storage;ProVerif 1.93;real-or-random model;Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic;computational overheads;smart card;password;personal biometrics;formal security verification;expensive elliptic curve point multiplication;extended chaotic maps;three-factor user remote user authentication protocol;wireless communication;authorized users;medical server data;remote access;crowdsourcing IoT applications;e-healthcare service;wearable devices;mobile devices;Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Medical services;Internet of Things;Chaotic communication;Smart cards;Biometrics;Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic;chaotic map;crowdsourcing;Internet of Things (IoT);ProVerif 193;security;user authentication},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2714179},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={9},   pages={68-73},   abstract={Radiological pollution, which poses a great threat to public health and environment safety, is one of the critical concerns in nuclear industries. The ever growing IIoT is a promising network paradigm for monitoring the radiological pollution level in uranium mill tailings. Coverage, as one of the most decisive indicators for evaluating the success of IIoT-based radiological pollution monitoring, reflects how well the sensing fields of interest are monitored. Nevertheless, the possible coverage holes resulting from sensors' random deployment, energy depletion, and hazardous conditions may remarkably lower the QoS, especially the coverage performance of IIoT-based radiological pollution monitoring. In order to avoid the potential emerging coverage holes' negative effects on the network QoS, this article focuses on the coverage hole detection issue from an energy-efficient perspective. By exploiting the merits of the CIC model, this article develops an EECICHD that detects the CIC holes by fully considering the sensor nodes' energy dissipation as well as their communication abilities. The EECICHD makes full use of the intrinsic spatial distribution correlation of monitored variables and collaborative sensing among neighboring sensors for improving the efficiency of CIC holes detection. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed EECICHD scheme can efficiently localize and determine the locations and number of the CIC holes.},   keywords={chemical industry;environmental science computing;health and safety;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;quality of service;radiology;sensor placement;uranium;waste handling;energy-efficient perspective;public health;environment safety;radiological pollution level;IIoT-based radiological pollution monitoring;energy depletion;sensor nodes;CIC holes detection;confident information coverage holes detection;Industrial Internet of Things;nuclear industries;uranium mill tailings;QoS;EECICHD;CIC model;sensor node energy dissipation;Smart devices;Pollution;Environmental monitoring;Internet of Things;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Quality of service},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1701195},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={SEPTEMBER},}

Each group represents a sub-system that has the variables strongly correlated with each other.

The Monitor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; system encapsulates a flexible set of general-purpose components to monitor the operation and connectivity of heterogeneous sensor devices (e.g. smart watches, smart phones, microphones, beacons, etc.), a local base-station, as well as a cloud server. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports different types of RRMSs in various contexts. The system also features a ground truth validation system to support obtaining ground truth in the field. Additionally, customized alerts can be sent to remote administrators and other personnel to report any dysfunction or inaccuracy of the system in real time. M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;G is applied to three very different case studies: the M2FED system which monitors family eating dynamics [1], an in-home wireless sensing system for monitoring nighttime agitation [2], and the BESI system which monitors behavioral and environmental parameters to predict health events and to provide interventions [3]. The results indicate that M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;G is a comprehensive system that (i) requires small cost in time and effort to adapt to an existing RRMS, (ii) provides reliable data collection and reduction in data loss by detecting faults in real-time, and (iii) provides a convenient and timely ground truth validation facility.},   keywords={cloud computing;computerised monitoring;home computing;mobile computing;smart phones;wireless sensor networks;M2FED system;in-home wireless sensing system;monitoring nighttime agitation;ground truth validation system;ground-truth validation capabilities;system functionality;long-term reliable operation management;residential monitoring systems;continuous monitoring;sensor systems;cyberphysical-systems;ground truth validation features;timely ground truth validation facility;convenient ground truth validation facility;comprehensive system;BESI system;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Base stations;Temperature measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Electronic mail;Real-time systems;Residential Monitoring System;Ground Truth Validation;Reliability;Fault Monitoring},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.107},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

One of these is represented by suitably estimating blood pressure values of subjects in a continuous, real-time and non-invasive way. To address it, we propose an approach only requiring a photoplethysmography sensor and a mobile/desktop device. The approach avails itself of Genetic Programming to automatically find an explicit relationship between blood pressure values and photoplethysmography ones. This relationship is tested on a set of eleven subjects and compared against other regression methods, and turns out to be better. Namely, the Root Mean Square Error values are equal to 8.49 and 6.66 for the systolic and the diastolic BP values, respectively. Those for the relative error, instead, are equal to 5.55% for the systolic and 6.59% for the diastolic values.},   keywords={Monitoring;Medical services;Blood pressure;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Industries;Mathematical model;Health 4.0;continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring;photoplethysmography signal;computational intelligence;genetic programming},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2832081},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={},}

Most localisation schemes focus on outdoor IoT. However, indoor IoT is required in some applications such as target detection and tracking, and emerging smarter healthcare. As such, localisation approaches designed for indoor IoT are necessary. Note that the smarter healthcare emerges at an unprecedented speed while few localisation schemes can be directly exploited for them with accuracy guarantee. In this study, the authors propose a wearable indoor localisation approach to improve the localisation accuracy of previous work. In this approach, the wearable devices embedded into person are used to realise their displacement vector in mobile environments, thus estimating their own locations.

Mandatory vehicle examination cannot be taken easily for each car, so it is difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Traffic lights considered as “Things” through the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) can be applied because there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area.

However, existing methods of manual measurement for battery or online battery monitoring system will require complicated wire connection and they are somehow risky during measurement. Meanwhile these operations will also require very professional personnel. Therefore, their applications have big limitation. This paper is to introduce a new type of battery and corresponding measurement (we named it as “Intelligent Battery”). We will apply new methods to measure battery condition using the communication way of power line carrier (PLC). This way of measurement will require a redesigning of storage battery which will bring revolutionary changes to battery and battery measurement.

To cope with this deficiency, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme adapted to eHealth systems considering a normal and an emergency health scenarios. Our proposed scheme satisfies both content and contextual privacy requirements, as well as secure communications and quality of service (QoS). To do, we used an identity-based encryption scheme, a set of privacy mechanisms, and a prioritized queuing model. Moreover, we established a performance evaluation to study the queuing behavior of the proposed system. Extensive security analysis shows the robustness of our scheme.

IoT architectures contribute to critical aspects of our society like transportation, health-care, industry, telecommunications and many others. Security is difficult to be implemented in the IoT context because the embedded devices are resource constrained and deployed in uncontrolled areas, thus being targeted by various security attacks. In scenarios like smart city, IoT networks are populated by both trusted and untrusted transient devices, thus mechanisms for mitigating complex security attacks must be implemented.

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={581-588},   abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;end-to-end security;healthcare Internet-of-Things;IoT;smart gateways;DTLS session resumption technique;remote end-users;security context;session resumption technique;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;energy performance evaluations;remote patient monitoring prototype;Conferences;Computers;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing},   doi={10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={167-172},   abstract={This paper presents a 3-step system that estimates the real-time energy expenditure of an individual in a non-intrusive way. First, using the user's smart-phone's sensors, we build a Decision Tree model to recognize his physical activity (running, standing,...). Then, we use the detected physical activity, the time and the user's speed to infer his daily activity (watching TV, going to the bathroom,...) through the use of a reinforcement learning environment, the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework. Once the daily activities are recognized, we translate this information into energy expenditure using the compendium of physical activities. By successfully detecting 8 physical activities at 90%, we reached an overall accuracy of 80% in recognizing 17 different daily activities. This result leads us to estimate the energy expenditure of the user with a mean error of 26% of the expected estimation.},   keywords={decision theory;decision trees;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;sensors;smart phones;Decision Tree model;detected physical activity;Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework;energy expenditure estimation;daily activity recognition;real-time energy expenditure;smart-phone sensor;reinforcement learning environment;Feature extraction;Activity recognition;Legged locomotion;Real-time systems;Accelerometers;Time-frequency analysis;Smart-phone;Metabolic Equivalents;Internet of Things;Decision Tree;Partially Observable Markov Decision Process},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355097},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

More and more mobile end devices require a high data rate connection e.g. to a smart home (Internet of Things, IoT) or to the internet. The radiation power pattern of base stations and mobile end devices will completely change for the 5G Next Generation Mobile Network technology which will use frequency bands up to 100 GHz. Therefore the electromagnetic exposure especially to human body will increase in the future, because most of the wireless connections are realized in RF technology. In this contribution two different measurement setups are presented. The first shows the electromagnetic radiation regarding a base station powered by a mobile phone provider over a timespan of a number of days. The second figures out the electromagnetic radiation of a handheld mobile end device to a human head in an area with very poor reception values. The results of those measurements where compared with legal and health limits. All measured and calculated results regarding the base stations were within the legal exposure limits. The calculated legal exposure limits of mobile devices were exceeded twice in areas within very poor reception values. Regarding the expected higher bandwidth and corresponding higher electromagnetic exposure to human bodies in future there have to be periodic measurements to comply with radiation limits.},   keywords={Fading channels;Rician channels;Relays;Wireless communication;Interchannel interference;Random variables;Probability density function;Mobile phone base station measurements;Legal electromagnetic radiation limits;Health electromagnetic radiation limits;5G Next Generation Mobile Networks},   doi={10.1109/COBCOM.2018.8443980},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;patient centric agent;privacy;PCA based architecture;continuous time patient monitoring architecture;real time patient monitoring architecture;continuous patient monitoring;block architecture;continuous remote patient monitoring;RPM architectures;RPM challenging;tier-based End to End architecture;healthcare;Internet of Things;IoT;Computer architecture;Medical services;Principal component analysis;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Blockchain;body area sensor network;healthcare;remote patient monitoring;patient centric agent;proof of work;streamed data;Internet of Things;dynamically generated session key;patient record encryption key},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846779},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Revolutionizing validation: The Intel approach for TTM}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={13-13},   abstract={Summary form only given. Intel is focused on gaining a foothold in the burgeoning mobile/IOT computing market. One of the unique challenges in this dynamic market is the aggressive time-to-market (TTM) requirement. In the past, the length of the silicon validation stage for Intel SoCs contributed to the company's inability to deliver products on time, taking up to two years for prior projects. To address this situation, the Devices System Validation group set a transformation goal to reduce time from first silicon to PRQ for base and derivative products. While a validation execution strategy can be optimized based on perceived risk in changes to HW, FW, and SW, accounting for silicon debug is far more difficult. It is nearly impossible to predict the amount of time necessary to debug the breadth and quantity of issues (Sightings) that will be found during execution. The number of sightings generated over the course of a project depends on many factors, including the health of the RTL and process, the stability of the FW and SW code base, and the technical strength of the execution team. This unpredictability results in many challenges when attempting to hit a target time window from first silicon to Production Ready Quality (PRQ). Moorefield, a platform based on Intel's 22 nm Atom-based SoC named Anniedale, was the first project to achieve a goal of first silicon to Production in two quarters. A major factor in this achievement was the strategy employed by the team to manage the risk in silicon validation and debug with aggressive shift left effort that included early and close collaboration with the customer, platform, and design teams. This strategy is built on several key pillars. 1) Comprehensive Design for Debug (DFD) features and tools that are fully validation in pre-silicon &amp;amp; emulation to prepare for critical debug scenarios at customer platforms. 2) Early and close engagement with the lead customer and platform teams to develop an alpha level quality SW in emulation. 3) Employing requirements-based validation to focus on validating only the form factor OS application use-cases. 4) A strict platform regressions strategy that can be scaled from pre to post silicon 5) Centralized System Debug organization to accelerate time to closure of critical sightings. In this talk we will be detailing and presenting the innovative strategies the System Validation (SV) organization took around the these pillars to achieve a successful launch of the Moorefield-based Asus tablet and phone in record breaking time.},   keywords={notebook computers;program debugging;quality control;risk management;system-on-chip;Intel approach;TTM requirement;time-to-market requirement;Intel SoC;system-on-chip;mobile computing market;IOT computing market;Internet-of-Things;Devices System Validation group;silicon debug;production ready quality;PRQ;Moorefield platform;Atom-based SoC;Anniedale SoC;DFD feature;design-for-debug feature;requirements-based validation;platform regression strategy;SV organization;system validation;Moorefield-based Asus tablet;risk management;customer engagement;form factor OS application use-cases;operating systems;Decision support systems;system validation;SOC;shift-left;DFD;emulation},   doi={10.1109/IDT.2015.7396728},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down.

The design of QoS in WBAN is a challenging task due to several reasons such as lossy channel, resource-constraint nodes and priority-based services. The QoS provisioning mechanisms mostly focus on the MAC layer and do not extend easily across all platforms. We propose to integrate the QoS design into the application layer using the standard CoAP framework. CoAP architecture is a platform independent standard intended to be used in simple electronics devices such as Internet of Things (IoT). We introduce three CoAP features such as Caching, Confirmability and Multicast addressing. We examine these options to deploy the QoS mechanism in the WBAN composed of sensors with heterogeneous priorities. The proposed solutions are universal and can be deployed on any sensor platform which supports the standard CoAP software protocol.},   keywords={access protocols;body area networks;quality of service;telecommunication network management;standard CoAP software protocol;multicast addressing;confirmability;caching;IoT;Internet of Things;CoAP architecture;standard CoAP framework;application layer;QoS design;MAC layer;QoS provisioning mechanism;priority-based services;resource-constraint nodes;lossy channel;WBAN;constraint application protocol framework;QoS management;wireless body area networks;quality of service;Sensors;Quality of service;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Protocols;Software;Medical services;Wireless Body Area Networks;Quality of Service;CoAP;Health Monitoring},   doi={10.1109/EIT.2016.7535236},   ISSN={2154-0373},   month={May},}

Smart grids (SG) have been proposed as a mechanism to modernize and facilitate the operation of energy grids in the presence of multiple third-parties vying to sell electricity and related services. Recently, a new concept has emerged in relation with SG: transactive energy - a framework to integrate and coordinate multiple independent suppliers of electric services in an economic marketplace that enables purchases in a way that obeys the physical constrains of the underlying energy grid. Our team is developing a transactive energy framework called Open Access Smart Grids (OASIS). OASIS features a distribution-level marketplace where the underlying electric resources and services are open to access and provisioned by third parties. In this paper, we present a cloudbased and big data-enabled brokerage system for Smart grids, which is a critical component of OASIS.

Since IoT applications are mainly for smart sensing, such as metering, home surveillance, disaster detection, and e-health, their special sensing/uploading behaviors will result in periodic and/or event-driven small data transmissions, which may potentially decrease the radio resource efficiency. On the other hand, the widespread deployment of IoT raises the concurrent massive connectivity of IoT devices. How to solve these two problems is a critical issue. In this paper, we investigate an uplink resource allocation problem which considers the periodic, event-driven, and query-based IoT traffic behaviors over LTE-M. The proposed approach takes advantage of data aggregation and both spatial and temporal reuse. Our solution exploits long-term static scheduling for periodic data to ensure the latency and data rate, and employs short-term dynamic scheduling for event-driven, query-based data to improve transmission efficiency. Therefore, both small data and massive connectivity problems are relieved. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve resource efficiency and enlarge network capacity effectively.},   keywords={data aggregation;data communication;frequency allocation;Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;query processing;radio links;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;spatial aggregation;temporal aggregation;LTE-M networks;machine-to-machine communication;M2M communication;Internet of Things;IoT applications;smart sensing;periodic data transmissions;event-driven small data transmissions;radio resource efficiency;IoT deployment;uplink resource allocation problem;query-based IoT traffic behaviors;data aggregation;spatial reuse;temporal reuse;long-term static scheduling;short-term dynamic scheduling;transmission efficiency improvement;massive connectivity problems;small data connectivity problems;resource efficiency improvement;network capacity;Logic gates;Uplink;Data aggregation;Dynamic scheduling;Quality of service;Resource management;Delays},   doi={10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925549},   ISSN={1558-2612},   month={March},}

Smartphones have been proposed as GWs in mobile M2M communications due to their enhanced connectivity and sensing capabilities. However, the GW functionality impacts on the smartphone usability, causing undesirable battery depletion and the smartphone itself increases the overall cost of e- health solutions.

 title={A Pervasive Integration Platform of Low-Cost MEMS Sensors and Wireless Signals for Indoor Localization}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Location service is fundamental to many IoT applications such as smart home, wearables, smart city, and connected health. With existing infrastructures, wireless positioning is widely used to provide the location service. However, wireless positioning has the limitations such as highly depending on the distribution of access points (APs); providing a low samplerate and noisy solution; requiring extensive labor costs to build databases; and having unstable RSS values in indoor environments. To reduce these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative integrated platform for indoor localization by integrating low-cost MEMS sensors and wireless signals. This proposed platform consists of wireless AP localization engine and sensor fusion engine, which is suitable for both dense and sparse deployments of wireless APs. The proposed platform can automatically generate wireless databases for positioning, and provide a positioning solution even in the area with only one observed wireless AP, where the traditional trilateration method cannot work. This integration platform can integrate different kinds of wireless APs together for indoor localization (e.g., WiFi, BLE, and RFID). The platform fuses all of these wireless distances with low-cost MEMS sensors to provide a robust localization solution. A multi-level quality control mechanism is utilized to remove noisy RSS measurements from wireless APs and to further improve the localization accuracy. Preliminary experiments show the proposed integration platform can achieve the average accuracy of 3.30 m with the sparse deployment of wireless APs (1 AP per 800 m&amp;#x00B2;).},   keywords={Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Engines;Micromechanical devices;Wireless fidelity;Sensor fusion;Indoor localization;inertial navigation system (INS);integration platform;WiFi;Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE);Received Signal Strength (RSS);multi-level quality control.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2785338},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

It improves the quality of medical services by allowing periodic patient diagnostics. As it collects and sends sensitive biomedical information, both content and contextual privacy requirements must be satisfied. Content privacy ensures the protection of patient information against inappropriate disclosure. Contextual privacy is about the context of the communication. Several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed. However, they only consider content privacy requirement. To fill this gap, we propose in this paper a new privacy preserving scheme adapted to e-Health systems, satisfying all privacy requirements, as well as communication security and authentication. Content privacy is based on cryptographic primitives. Contextual privacy relies on the onion routing concept, fake messages injection and a multicast strategy. To validate our proposal, a security and performance analysis are reported. The security analysis confirms its safety and proves its resistance to a set of security attacks.

The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers.

Therefore, in this work we design and implement an OM2M 'plugin' that can aggregate small IoT data effectively. We will show how the plugin works and verify the effectiveness on the network bandwidth in this demonstration.},   keywords={data aggregation;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;telecommunication services;small packet aggregation;machine to machine networks;M2M networks;OM2M implementation;Internet of Things;open source platform;M2M communication;oneM2M standards;SmartM2M standards;M2M services;IoT devices;M2M devices;control overhead;OM2M plugin;Conferences;Mobile communication;Sensor systems;Data aggregation;Internet of Things (IoT);machine-to-machine communication (M2M);open source platform for M2M communication (OM2M);oneM2M;smartM2M},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2016.062},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

However, footballers face serious injuries during the match and even during training. Concussion, hypoglycemia, swallowing the tongue and shortness of breath are examples of the health problems footballers face, and in extreme cases, may lead to death. In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health. This paper proposes an IoT-based architecture for the sport of football, called IoT Football. Our proposal aims to embed sensing devices (e.g. sensors and RFID), telecommunication technologies (e.g. ZigBee) and cloud computing in the sport of football in order monitor the health of footballers and reduce the occurrence of adverse health conditions.

The connection of IoT to applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is common in order to propose practical solutions. Simultaneously, games are known to increase interest and motivation among students when they are designed with pedagogic intent. Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them. But as our application gathers information that are relevant for remediation, it is also a forward useful solution to doctors who are always busy and who might check the display of children without an actual meeting.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;Internet Of Things;wireless sensor networks;WSN;dyslexic children;medical care;IoT;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Sensors;Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Software;Games},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417598},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},   keywords={body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;healthcare;power consumption;statistical techniques;bandwidth consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;wireless human gait monitoring system;Decision support systems;Internet;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Body Area Networks},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the intensive care unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a biosensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things (IoT) system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system acts as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application.

This paper introduces an approach to sensor data analytics by using the OpenIoT<sup>1</sup>middleware; real time event processing and clustering algorithms have been used for this purpose. The OpenIoT platform has been extended to support stream processing and thus we demonstrate its flexibility in enabling real time on-demand application domain analytics. We use mobile crowd-sensed data, provided in real time from wearable sensors, to analyse and infer air quality conditions. This experimental evaluation has been implemented using the design principles and methods for IoT data interoperability specified by the OpenIoT project.

However interoperability within different healthcare systems (clinics/hospitals/pharmacies) remains an issue of further research due to a lack of collaboration and exchange of healthcare information. To solve this problem, cross healthcare system collaboration is required. This paper proposes a conceptual semantic based healthcare collaboration framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure that is able to offer a secure cross system information and knowledge exchange between different healthcare systems seamlessly that is readable by both machines and humans. In the proposed framework, an intelligent semantic gateway is introduced where a web application with restful Application Programming Interface (API) is used to expose the healthcare information of each system for collaboration.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={206-211},   abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},   keywords={cardiology;cardiovascular system;diseases;electroencephalography;Haar transforms;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;time series;individual physiological time series;biosignal processing system;Haar Transform;IoT application;Internet of Things;blood pressure;heart rate;EEG;chronic diseases;urgent diseases;cardiovascular disease;Time series analysis;Transforms;Correlation;Physiology;Medical services;Market research;Euclidean distance;time series;correlation;Haar wavelet;Haar transform;distance measure;clustering;healthcare;IoT},   doi={10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54},   ISSN={2471-7819},   month={Oct},}

It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT.

Interoperability and standardization are imperative for the realization of this vision. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications standards can be the middleware that glues together the IoT. However, standards are highly complex and require a large amount of interpretation, deployments are currently scarce, and performance evaluations simplistic or speculative. In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications. Moreover, we observe that latencies between a smartphone GW and cloud hosted services vary largely depending on the user mobility, and on the promotion delay of the used wireless network.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cellular radio;cloud computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;middleware;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);protocols;smart phones;synchronisation;telecommunication network planning;mobile IoT application latency;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communications;M2M communication standards;IoT service composition;mobile gateways;application protocol overheads;standard M2M middleware;mobile e-health;ETSI M2M standards;openEHR standards;remote monitoring;cellular network;smartphone GW;cloud hosted services;user mobility;promotion delay;wireless network;Cellular networks;e-health;Internet of Things (IoT);machine-to-machine (M2M) communications;mobile gateways (GWs);smartphones;system performance;wireless networks},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689682},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

The amount of information generated in this environment has led to an unprecedented increase in data collection. One of the major challenges for its development lies in the storage and the processing of this huge volume of data into acceptable measurement and analysis parameters. This research takes up this challenge by storing and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research, sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner. The data collected by the sensors show that the avarage levels of carbon monoxide are well above the international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO).},   keywords={Big Data;carbon compounds;data analysis;gas sensors;Internet of Things;microcontrollers;transport protocols;Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol;big data techniques;data collection;exploratory analysis;carbon monoxide levels;Big Data environment;Big Data tools;IoT storage;visualization data;carbon monoxide sensors;Internet of Things;Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area;stream sensor processing;batch sensor processing;microcontroller unit;CO;Sensors;Big Data;Servers;Tools;Urban areas;Internet of Things;Carbon;Internet of Things;Sensor Data Mining;Hadoop Architecture;Smart Cities},   doi={10.1109/IRI.2017.76},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={A significant challenge in creating an operational prognostic health management (PHM) system in the aerospace industry is building a secure, reliable system architecture that is capable of gathering, organizing, and processing large amounts of relevant data from numerous potentially disparate assets. This is further complicated by capturing the information whether the assets are co-located or geographically distributed over a large area. This is one of the reasons that historically PHM has not been utilized on individual aerospace assets, resulting in systems that have either limited or no PHM capabilities requiring a fleet-based statistical PHM approach. Advanced PHM systems that provide tracking for individual assets have the potential for large lifecycle cost reductions and the ability to better understand the current state of each asset and assess the overall readiness of the fleet. This is driving a search for technologies in other comparative industries that can assist in overcoming this problem in the aerospace industry. This paper presents the Internet of Things (IoT) as a potential solution to this problem. Background information on IoT including history, current state-of-the-art, limitations, and the ecosystem of IoT are provided. The applicability of IoT technologies to PHM in the aerospace industry is discussed. A case study where commercially available IoT technologies were used as the framework on which a prototype PHM system was developed, including diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, for monitoring the health of a fleet of aerospace launch system assets is presented. Challenges and lessons learned from this case study are enumerated, and future work in the areas of system scalability and security are further elucidated.},   keywords={aerospace industry;condition monitoring;Internet of Things;statistical analysis;individual aerospace assets;PHM capabilities;statistical PHM approach;advanced PHM systems;lifecycle cost reductions;aerospace industry;commercially available IoT technologies;prototype PHM system;diagnostic capabilities;prognostic capabilities;aerospace launch system assets;PHM architecture;aerospace applications;operational prognostic health management system;secure system architecture;reliable system architecture;fleet-based statistical PHM approach;Prognostics and health management;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Sensors;Aerospace industry;Orbits},   doi={10.1109/AERO.2018.8396783},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The consequences of the exploitation of natural resources are evident in the current bad environmental conditions. For this reason, governments have implemented realtime environmental measurement systems and they have applied strategies focused to restrict the physical activities and avoid futures health problem. Even, in critical cases, the governments take measures to stop the movement of motor vehicles when the threshold of World Health Organization (WHO) is exceeded. The governmental measurement systems are limited because of high cost and they are typically located in big cities with few points of measure losing a lot of information in the uncovered areas. This work presents the development and implementation of a low cost georeferenced air-pollution measurement system that offers information of particulate measurement PM1, PM2.5 y PM10 by scatter. In addition, the system measures the levels of ozone concentration, and atmospheric variables such as temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. The whole system is connected to a low cost microprocessor with integrated Wi-Fi allowing to send the data to the cloud in real-time using MQTTprotocol, and thus the data can be georeferenced and published on an open access platform, used to the Internet of Things (IoT), for the acquisition and visualization of the data. In this way, the information is public and the residents of a particular area can look for the nearest measure of the environmental conditions. This work proposes a simple and cheap way to implement a measurement system allowing it to be easily replicated. The consequences for the health because of exposition to pollutants are serious, it implies a public policy issues with direct effect in the economy and development of cities.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={25-32},   abstract={The consumer wearable economy is a rapidly growing sector with an ever increasingly number of use cases mostly focused on the quantified self. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers for connected smartphone apps, wearables typically come equipped with a wide variety of different sensors such as accelerometers, pulsometors, and thermometers to capture data such as, respectively, the user's movements, heart-rate, and temperature. Once data is captured it is then typically wirelessly transmitted, using Bluetooth LE (low energy) to an awaiting smartphone. Since the data may be sensitive and/or personally identifiable, it is critical that this exchange and the pairing mechanisms used to set up the connection remain secure and resilient to eavesdropping attacks. This paper empirically evaluates the data exchange mechanisms of a variety of major commercial wearable products to determine if, and how well, the products live up to this security constraint. As part of this effort, the work also investigates the three different types of Bluetooth LE pairing strategies at a packet and protocol level. The results show presumably secure pairing strategies have glaring security vulnerabilities that affect all of the devices examined. In addition to this publication, efforts are underway to report these vulnerabilities to US-CERT.},   keywords={Bluetooth;electronic data interchange;Internet of Things;security of data;sensors;smart phones;wearable computers;data exchange mechanism security;wearable Internet of Things;fitness tracking;mobile health monitoring;smartphone apps;sensors;eavesdropping attacks;Bluetooth LE pairing;packet level;protocol level;Security;Bluetooth;Biomedical monitoring;Advertising;Protocols;Trade agreements;Sensors;Bluetooth;wearables;internet of things;man-in-the-middle attacks;security;pairing;vulernability discovery},   doi={10.1109/MobServ.2016.15},   ISSN={2329-6453},   month={June},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={903-907},   abstract={Connected data has always been considered as a primary source to knowledge. Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={9464-9472},   abstract={Meeting application requirements under a tight power budget is of a primary importance to enable connected health internet of things applications. This paper considers using sparse representation and well-defined inequality indexes drawn from the theory of inequality to distinguish ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) from non-VEBs. Our approach involves designing a separate dictionary for each arrhythmia class using a set of labeled training QRS complexes. Sparse representation, based on the designed dictionaries of each new test QRS complex is then calculated. Following this, its class is predicted using the winner-takes-all principle by selecting the class with the highest inequality index. The experiments showed promising results ranging between 80% and 100% for the detection of VEBs considering the patient-specific approach, 80% using cross validation and 70% on unseen data using independent sets for training and testing, respectively. An efficient hardware implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is also presented. The results show that the proposed hardware implementation can classify a QRS complex in 69.3 ms that use only 0.934 W energy.},   keywords={diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;signal classification;sparse representation;arrhythmia class;multipliers algorithm;inequality indexes;health internet of things applications;QRS complexes;ventricular ectopic beats detection;Dictionaries;Indexes;Optimization;Hardware;Convex functions;Clustering algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Inequality indexes;dictionary learning;ADMM;arrhythmia;classification;connected health;QRS},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780190},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Therefore, it is crucial that each entity has the capability of safeguarding its security features on its own. Methods based on harnessing the random identification and authentication from the physical device and environment, such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), if securely run, are promising primitives for protecting lightweight IoT devices. This paper presents the first Built-In-Self-Test scheme for on-the-fly evaluation of PUFs that can also be utilized for assessing the desired statistical properties of TRNGs. Unlike earlier known PUF evaluation suites that were software-based and offline, our methodology enables online assessment of the pertinent statistical and security properties all in hardware. Specifically, the BIST structure is designed to evaluate two main properties of PUFs: unpredictability and stability. Our work is the first online test suite that thoroughly evaluates the internal health of the entropy source of TRNGs along with the statistical properties of the generated bit stream. Comprehensive real-time evaluation by the BIST method is able to ensure robustness and security of both TRNG and PUF in the face of operational, structural, and environmental fluctuations due to variations, aging, or adversarial acts. Proof-of-concept implementation of our BIST methodology in FPGA demonstrates its reasonable overhead, effectiveness, and practicality.},   keywords={Built-in self-test;Security;Entropy;Field programmable gate arrays;Stability analysis;Generators;Jitter;Built-In-Self-Test;BIST;physical unclonable functions;puf;true random number generators;trng;hardware security;internet of things;IoT;Built-In-Self-Test;BIST;physical unclonable functions;puf;true random number generators;trng;hardware security;internet of things;IoT},   doi={10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2519902},   ISSN={2332-7766},   month={Jan},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Buildings became complex systems where there are various technologies integrated together and thus should work as a single system. Modern building has several monitoring and control systems which should cooperate together to achieve energy saving while keeping indoor comfort and healthy environment. The overall building management systems (BMS) provides an integrated way to gather data from the building and issue control commands to the installed technology. The parameters that are monitored in modern buildings are not only temperature and humidity but todays buildings monitor also concentration values of CO2 or volatile organic compounds (VOC). The experience from last decades shows necessity to monitor also the structure of the building. Renewable materials (wood) are today often used for building construction. This material is quite sensitive to environmental factors like humidity and the environment has to be monitored in order to avoid structural health problems in future. Specially timber when exposed to humidity or moisture can degrade quite quickly and can lose load capacity. Modern communication technologies allows installation of many sensors directly into the structure which allows continuous monitoring of the building construction as well as the indoor climate in the building. Internet of Things (IoT) allows new communication technologies providing low cost, low power sensor application within smart city sector.},   keywords={building management systems;environmental factors;Internet of Things;smart cities;smart building monitoring;indoor environment;monitoring;control systems;energy saving;indoor comfort;healthy environment;building management systems;BMS;volatile organic compounds;VOC;renewable materials;building construction;environmental factors;communication technologies;indoor climate;Internet of Things;IoT;low power sensor application;smart city sector;Buildings;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Humidity;Indoor environments},   doi={10.1109/SCSP.2017.7973859},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2016},   volume={5},   number={3},   pages={60-70},   abstract={This article is a single-source introduction to the emerging concept of smart cities. It can be used for familiarizing researchers with the vast scope of research possible in this application domain. The smart city is primarily a concept, and there is still not a clear and consistent definition among practitioners and academia. As a simplistic explanation, a smart city is a place where traditional networks and services are made more flexible, efficient, and sustainable with the use of information, digital, and telecommunication technologies to improve the city's operations for the benefit of its inhabitants. Smart cities are greener, safer, faster, and friendlier. The different components of a smart city include smart infrastructure, smart transportation, smart energy, smart health care, and smart technology. These components are what make the cities smart and efficient. Information and communication technology (ICT) are enabling keys for transforming traditional cities into smart cities. Two closely related emerging technology frameworks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data (BD), make smart cities efficient and responsive. The technology has matured enough to allow smart cities to emerge. However, there is much needed in terms of physical infrastructure, a smart city, the digital technologies translate into better public services for inhabitants and better use of resources while reducing environmental impacts. One of the formal definitions of the smart city is the following: a city "connecting the physical infrastructure, the information-technology infrastructure, the social infrastructure, and the business infrastructure to leverage the collective intelligence of the city". Another formal and comprehensive definition is "a smart sustainable city is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects". Any combination of various smart components can make cities smart. A city need not have all the components to be labeled as smart. The number of smart components depends on the cost and available technology.},   keywords={Internet of Things;smart cities;sustainable development;town and country planning;smart cities;Internet of Things;digital technology;information and communication technology;ICT;IoT;Big Data;BD;smart sustainable city;Smart cities;Transportation;Smart buildings;Smart grids;Internet of things},   doi={10.1109/MCE.2016.2556879},   ISSN={2162-2248},   month={July},}

The real-time pre-alarm for the instability of tailings dam is vital to ensure the normal mining and safety of human lives and properties. Based on the Internet of Things and wireless networks, the multiple and the key information system of tailings dam is constructed using the sensor data, which include the stability indexes like phreatic line, reservoir water level, internal and external deformation of the tailings dam. The cloud platform is applied to predict the future state of the phreatic line based on real-time monitoring data, where the equation of phreatic line can be obtained. The numerical simulation model is established by considering the predicted equation of phreatic line, limit equilibrium state parameters, reservoir water level, and rainfall. Then, the safety factor, random reliability, and interval non-probabilistic reliability can be solved out through the cloud platform. Combined with the trend of real-time monitoring deformation, as well as calculated dynamic safety factor, random reliability, and interval non-probabilistic reliability, the stable or dangerous warning signals of tailings dam can be obtained by the remote real-time pre-alarm system.

To evaluate the performance of a flexible solar panel under skin, ex-vivo experiments are conducted under natural sunlight and artificial light sources. The results show that the solar panel covered by a 3 mm thick porcine flap can output tens of microWatts to a few milliWatts depending on the light conditions. The subcutaneous solar energy harvester is tested on different body parts, which suggests the optimal position for the harvester to implant is between neck and shoulder. A wireless implantable system powered by the subcutaneous energy harvester is presented, which consists of a power management circuit, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth low energy module. An application is developed for data visualization on mobile devices, which can be a gateway for future IoT-based healthcare applications. The entire device is embedded in a transparent silicone housing (38 mm × 32 mm × 4 mm), including a 7 mAh rechargeable battery for energy storage. The average power consumption of the implants is about 30 μW in a 10 min operation cycle.

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.},   keywords={data mining;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;medical computing;recommender systems;text analysis;recommendation system;proactive health monitoring;Internet of Things;IoT world;wearable technological devices;health attributes;personalized advised wearables;recommendation engine;unstructured medical history;text mining;structured demographic attributes;machine learning classification model;eventual diseases;mathematical optimization model;optimal wearable devices;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diseases;Wearable sensors;Temperature sensors;IoT;Healthcare;Monitoring;Wearable Technologies;Analytics;Text Mining;Optimization},   doi={10.1109/AIMS.2017.11},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Moreover, with the help of software defined networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any trusted third party. Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching. Finally, we do comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world smartphones to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed schemes.},   keywords={biomedical communication;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;mobile computing;smart phones;social networking (online);software defined networking;symptom matching schemes;SDN;MHSNs;coarse-grained symptom matching;fine-grained symptom matching;mobile healthcare social networks;software defined networking paradigm;user experience;personal health information sharing;similar symptoms matching process;symptoms information;privacy concerns;private symptoms;healthcare system;privacy-preserving symptom matching;access control;Medical services;Privacy;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Social network services;Smart phones;Internet of Things;Blind signature;coarse/fine-grained;mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs);symptoms matching},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2799209},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

The existing study normalized the PHMPRs by adding additional preference values with the probability information into the shorter element before modifying the consistency and consensus. As a supplement, in this paper, we focus on dealing with the consistency and consensus for PHMPRs by means of multiplicative preference relations. We first present the definition of geometric consistency index for PHMPRs and develop an automatic iterative algorithm for checking and improving the geometric consistency index for PHMPRs. We also put forward the concept of geometric consensus degree for PHMPRs and then devise an automatic consensus reaching algorithm to modify the geometric consensus degree of PHMPRs. After that, a novel complete group decision making model with PHMPRs is put forward. Finally, an illustrative example is shown to verify the proposed model and we compare it with the existing study to show its superiority.},   keywords={Probabilistic logic;Decision making;Prognostics and health management;Indexes;Finite element analysis;Iterative methods;Agriculture;Hesitant multiplicative preference relation;Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relation;Probabilistic hesitant multiplicative preference relation;Hesitant fuzzy set;Consistency},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876403},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This provides new opportunities for enhancing healthcare through participatory consultation, medical diagnosis and many other novel healthcare services. Some of the advantages of this emerging technology referred to in this paper as “Cyber-healthcare” includes low acquisition cost, flexible deployment and improved accuracy resulting from replacing manual operations by fully digitized processes. It is expected that the emerging healthcare technology will change the way healthcare is delivered in both rural and urban settings of the developing world by building upon this technology to leapfrog from poorly prepared to medically equipped environments capable of tackling some of the most challenging medical issues of the developing world such as patients' vital signs capture, patient prioritization and preparedness to virus outbreaks such as Ebola. This paper proposes a Cyber-healthcare system as a first step towards the implementation of least cost digital health systems in the developing countries.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={19-24},   abstract={Obesity is one of the most serious and dangerous nutrition disorder around the world. Usually, people develop patterns of unhealthy eating that lead to increased body weight and accumulation of fat in the body. There are many reasons for that as suggested by researchers; one of the reasons is the imbalance between the energy intake from food and energy consumed in the body, which can possibly lead to increased body weight. One of the primary treatments for this serious health risk include diets, physical activity, weight-loss training and adoption of health programs that promote healthy eating. As such, reliable mechanism to prevent and control the obesity levels is vital. It led many experts and researchers who are interested in the health sector to explore more solutions that help to combat the obesity phenomenon. This paper presents a mobile health application intended to increase the awareness levels of parents and children about the obesity risks and help them to sustain balanced and healthy eating lifestyle. The proposed mobile application is an educational tool for the evaluation of interventions to prevent obesity risk levels. The application is based on the Internet-of-Things approach, which allows tracking food intake, remote capturing and constant monitoring of children data with interactive feedback displayed on the mobile application.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Internet of Things;mobile radio;patient monitoring;risk management;mobile health monitoring application;obesity management;Internet-of-Things;health risk;diets,physical activity;weight-loss training;health programs;health sector;obesity phenomenon;obesity risk levels;food intake trackng;interactive feedback;mobile application;Pediatrics;Mobile communication;Obesity;Monitoring;Internet;Sensors;Internet of Things;eHealth;mHealth;Geolocation;Internet},   doi={10.1109/ICDIPC.2016.7470785},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising technology that provides, besides ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units. However, apart from power efficiency, opportune and reliable information delivery is mandatory in time-critical applications. In this paper we propose an analytical model of the delay performance of Bluetooth Low Energy for connection-oriented applications under different bit error conditions. In addition to the physical over-the-air latency, we also analyze the effect of the occurrence time of an Application Layer event on the effective transmission delay.

An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health.

Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage.},   keywords={agriculture;crops;Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;irrigation;soil;soil pollution;soil testing;crop management practices;Internet of Things device;water usage;data communication;Global Positioning System;humidity sensors;open hardware;planting;artificial resources;natural resources;soil erosion;production cycles;food production;nutrient depletion;remote monitoring systems;precision agriculture;irrigation management systems;sugar cane crops;IoT device;crop health;local climate data;soil conditions;soil temperature;Brazil;Temperature measurement;Soil;Agriculture;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Soil measurements;precision agriculture;internet of things;agri-tech;remote monitoring},   doi={10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239290},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

These limitations cannot only compromise applications' performance but can also affect trust and security in the IoT ecosystem. Besides security and trust, energy efficiency is also of paramount importance as sensors are often battery-operated. For energy minimisation and data security purposes, several contributions have mainly focused either on data compression, or data encryption; however, considering those as two independent operations. The last few years, the Compressive Sensing theory has shown that compression and encryption can be used simultaneously, given that data are sparse in some domain. As data sparsity cannot be known in advance, here, we present a practical implementation of a compressive sensing system where the data sparsity is estimated, and the compression rate is selected accordingly. Our system consists of two entities: a server implemented in Java running on a powerful machine, and a client that runs in a miniature sensor, developed in C and executing in the Contiki operating system.

Internet of things (IoT), fog computing, cloud computing and data analytics together offer a great opportunity to increase productivity in the dairy industry. In this paper, we present a fog computing assisted application system for animal behaviour analysis and health monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. The sensed data from sensors is sent to a fog based platform for data classification and analysis, which includes decision making capabilities. The solution aims towards keeping track of the animals' well-being by delivering early warning alerts generated through behavioural analytics, thus aiding the farmer to monitor the health of their livestock and the capability to identify potential diseases at an early stage, thereby also helping in increasing milk yield and productivity. The proposed system follows a service based model, avoids vendor lock-in, and is also scalable to add new features such as the detection of calving, heat, and issues like lameness.},   keywords={agriculture;cloud computing;dairy products;dairying;data analysis;decision making;diseases;Internet of Things;medical computing;fog computing assisted application system;animal behaviour analysis;dairy farming scenario;fog based platform;data classification;decision making capabilities;animals;early warning alerts;behavioural analytics;fog assisted application support;widely connected devices;cloud computing;dairy industry;Internet of Things;data analytics;Cloud computing;Cows;Monitoring;Sensors;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Fog Computing;Cloud Computing;Internet of Things (IoT);Smart Farm;Dairy Farming;Real-time;Data Analytics;Microservices},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355141},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

The Internet of Things ecosystem foregrounds some important aspects related to gerontology, genetics, biorhythmology, and gravitational biology. Sociological understanding of people's role in formation of the new high IT dependence reality allows to determine the main vectors of farsighted forecast. The technological evolution can be described as subsequent stages: distribution of IT - automation - Digital transformation and Internet of Things - Big Data analytics - Artificial Intelligence solutions - people connection to Augmented Reality - Context-as-A-Service - NBIC- and GRAIN-technologies - Humanity Plus. The essence of concept “patient” is changing. Patient transforms into an e-patient (all records about patient have been digitized) and then into Internet-patient with monitoring of health parameters within the Internet of Things surrounding people. Getting Augmented Reality patient is becoming a Digital patient. Augmented Reality methods are already being developed to treat patients.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={466-469},   abstract={Diabetic ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},   keywords={cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones;flexible wound assessment system;diabetic patient;Android smartphone;diabetic ulcers;wound assessment;visual examination;wound size;healing status;caregivers;high-resolution digital camera;chronic ulcer image analysis;wound image analysis system;Android App;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;skin color;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;Wounds;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Diabetes;Algorithm design and analysis;Smart phones;Patients with diabetes;Android Smartphones;Android App;RGB color evaluation;Mean Shift Algorithm},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={Energy-Efficient Deployment of Edge Dataenters for Mobile Clouds in Sustainable IoT}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Achieving quick responses with limited energy consumption in mobile cloud computing is an active area of research. The energy consumption increases when a user’s request (task) runs in the local mobile device instead of executing in the cloud. Whereas, latency become an issue when the task executes in the cloud environment instead of the mobile device. Therefore, a trade-off between energy consumption and latency is required in building sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) and for that, we have introduced a middle layer named an edge computing layer to avoid latency in IoT. There are several real-time applications such as smart city and smart health, where mobile users upload their tasks into the cloud or execute locally. We have intended to minimize the energy consumption of a mobile device as well as the energy consumption of the cloud system while meeting a task’s deadline, by offloading the task to the edge datacenter or cloud. This paper proposes an adaptive technique to optimize both parameters i.e. energy consumption and latency by offloading the task and also by selecting the appropriate virtual machine for the execution of the task. In the proposed technique, if the specified edge datacenter is unable to provide resources, then the user’s request will be sent to the cloud system. Finally, proposed technique is evaluated using a real world scenario to measure its performance and efficiency. The simulation results show that the total energy consumption and execution time decreases after introducing an edge datacenters as a middle layer.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Task analysis;Mobile handsets;Energy consumption;Delays;Resource management;Batteries;Cloud computing;Latency;Edge datacenter;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Task scheduling;IoT},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872722},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

When we talk about Internet of things (IoT), there are large numbers of distinct devices which are connected throughout different systems. These systems provide open platform to all digital devices accessing data from such systems. So, it becomes quite difficult to design such a system for IoT which can handle large classification of devices and also technologies like link layer associated to it.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Global health which denotes equitable access to healthcare, particularly in remote-rural-developing regions, is characterized by unique challenges of affordability, accessibility, and availability for which one of the most promising technological interventions that is emerging is the Internet of Things (IoT) based remote health monitoring. We present an IoT based smart edge system for remote health monitoring, in which wearable vital sensors transmit data into two novel software engines, namely Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis (RASPRO) and Criticality Measure Index (CMI) alerts, both of which we have implemented in the IoT smart edge. RASPRO transforms voluminous sensor data into clinically meaningful summaries called Personalized Health Motifs (PHMs). The CMI alerts engine computes an aggregate criticality score. Our IoT smart edge employs a risk-stratified protocol consisting of rapid guaranteed push of alerts &amp; PHMs directly to the physicians, and best effort pull of detailed data-on-demand (DD-on-D) through the cloud. We have carried out both clinical validation and performance evaluation of our smart edge system. The clinical validation on 183 patients demonstrated that the IoT smart edge is highly effective in remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of cardiac conditions, as quantified by three measures, precision (0.87), recall (0.83), and F1-score (0.85). Furthermore, performance evaluation showed significant reductions in the bandwidth (98%) and energy (90%), thereby making it suitable for emerging narrow-band IoT networks. In the deployment of our system in the cardiology institute of our University hospital, we observed that our IoT smart edge helped to increase the availability of physicians by 59%. Hence, our IoT smart edge system is a significant step towards addressing the requirements for global health.},   keywords={Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Electrocardiography;Internet of Things;Logic gates;Biomedical monitoring},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2870068},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In contrast, the use of wireless sensors to capture physiological data from patients for long term health monitoring is becoming increasingly popular although some previous studies recorded complaints from users about discomfort when wearing these. In addition, these systems can sometimes suffer from interference from existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is both comfortable to use and does not encounter interference with existing wireless traffic is required. This paper presents a system design that includes a probe, sensor, radio, and receiver for a long term heart rate monitoring in a senior center. This system has been deployed in a senior center since May 2012, and 63 seniors have used this system in this period. The senior center has its own wireless network, and no changes were made to this.

There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario. Finally, we conducted a scalability analysis to determine the feasibility of deploying IReHMo in large numbers in regions of north Sweden.},   keywords={biomedical communication;data communication;geriatrics;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;IReHMo;IoT-based remote health monitoring system;smart regions;ageing population;home stay;healthcare data;network requirements;bandwidth requirements;data generation;network communication protocols;CoAP;MQTT;HTTP;single sensor event;scalability analysis;north Sweden;Monitoring;Protocols;Senior citizens;Logic gates;Bandwidth;Encryption;remote health monitoring;Internet of Things;sensor communication;eHealth;smart city;smart region},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454565},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In this paper, we present a fully printed sensor capable of noninvasive material thickness detection. By applying an oscillating signal between two millimeter-scale electrodes, the fringing electric field is measurably perturbed by a material placed directly on top of the electrodes, leading to a linearly varying capacitance with change in the material's thickness. We simulate this electric field perturbation and experimentally demonstrate the linear correlation between capacitance and overlying material thickness. Various parameters, from sensor size and structure to substrate and ink materials, are studied to optimize the performance of the printed sensors. Sensors made of metallic carbon nano-tube ink yield the best sensitivity, exhibiting a capacitance change of 26 fF per mm thickness of rubber-ten times more sensitive than devices composed of silver nanoparticle ink. Finally, we demonstrate an effective application of the sensors in automobile tires. By applying the sensors directly beneath the tread (within the tire), mm changes in the tread depth are able to be detected in a 99% confidence interval. These findings provide a straightforward, low-cost approach for monitoring mm changes in material thickness using noninvasive, printed sensors applicable to innumerable Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.},   keywords={carbon nanotubes;electric sensing devices;Internet of Things;nanoparticles;nanosensors;silver;thickness measurement;noninvasive material thickness detection;aerosol jet printed sensors;electric field perturbation;metallic carbon nanotube ink;silver nanoparticle ink;Internet-of-Things;C;Ag;Ink;Electrodes;Capacitance;Capacitance measurement;Capacitive sensors;Substrates;Aerosol jet printing;printed sensors;carbon nanotubes;material thickness detection;Internet-of-Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2017.2710085},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={July},}

However, how to automatically collect and analyze the large-scale user-generated data that are relevant to tobacco in participatory media is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach of sensing collective activities in tobacco-related participatory media. Meanwhile, we compare the temporal patterns, topological patterns, and collective emotion patterns among protobacco, antitobacco, and quit-tobacco groups. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was implemented to collect large-scale tobacco-related data sets from Facebook. This demonstrates that the proposed framework is feasible and reasonable. Our preliminary findings reveal that, first, tobacco-related content grows exponentially. In particular, the growth of the protobacco group follows the exponential law, whereas there is linear growth for the tobacco control group. Second, the connection between the tobacco control community and the tobacco cessation community is tight, whereas the nodes in the protobacco community are connected sparsely. Finally, the collective emotion in tobacco communities is negative.},   keywords={data acquisition;human computer interaction;social networking (online);tobacco products;tobacco-oriented activities sensing;online participatory media;mobile Internet of Things;tobacco wars;temporal patterns;topological patterns;collective emotion patterns;protobacco groups;antitobacco groups;quit-tobacco groups;large-scale tobacco-related data sets collection;Facebook;tobacco-related content;exponential law;tobacco control community;tobacco cessation community;online tobacco surveillance system;user interaction;Media;Facebook;Communities;Sensors;Surveillance;Data mining;Data collection;Facebook;Internet of Things (IoT);participatory media;public health;tobacco control;tobacco surveillance},   doi={10.1109/JSYST.2014.2304706},   ISSN={1932-8184},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={64},   number={3},   pages={390-398},   abstract={A correct balance of nutrient intake is very important, particularly in infants. When the body is deprived of essential nutrients, it can lead to serious disease and organ deterioration which can cause serious health issues in adulthood. Automated monitoring of the nutritional content of food provided to infants, not only at home but also in daycare facilities, is essential for their healthy development. To address this challenge, this paper presents a new Internet of Things (IoT)-based fully automated nutrition monitoring system, called Smart-Log, to advance the state-of-art in smart healthcare. For the realization of Smart-Log, a novel 5-layer perceptron neural network and a Bayesian network-based accurate meal prediction algorithm are presented in this paper. Smart-Log is prototyped as a consumer electronics product which consists of WiFi enabled sensors for food nutrition quantification, and a smart phone application that collects nutritional facts of the food ingredients. The Smart-Log prototype uses an open IoT platform for data analytics and storage. Experimental results consisting of 8172 food items for 1000 meals show that the prediction accuracy of Smart-Log is 98.6%.},   keywords={belief networks;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;multilayer perceptrons;paediatrics;patient monitoring;smart phones;IoT;nutrient intake;infants;smart healthcare;5-layer perceptron neural network;Bayesian network-based accurate meal prediction algorithm;food nutrition quantification;smart phone application;nutritional facts;Smart-Log prototype;automated nutrition monitoring system;Internet of Things;deep-learning;daycare facilities;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Bayes methods;Medical services;Microcontrollers;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);consumer electronics;smart healthcare;smart home;food monitoring;nutrition monitoring},   doi={10.1109/TCE.2018.2867802},   ISSN={0098-3063},   month={Aug},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={197-202},   abstract={Diabetes is an incurable disease where the body is not able to maintain the blood sugar level as the glucose in the blood is not utilize due to the destruction of the beta pancreatic cell of the liver. Blood sugar level of body is a very important factor for health and it should be maintain within the desired level or else this would result in complications and often serious damage to the body. Therefore treatment must be provided in case of high or low blood sugar level. In case of high blood sugar level, insulin must be injected and in case of low blood sugar level we should inject glucagon into the body. This paper is concerned on advanced method of simulation that can be used to implement a real insulin and glucagon pump that can work in real time to prevent the fatal effects of diabetes on body. This system also covers all the safety critical system aspect required to build a system that has a direct effect on human life. To provide better insulin and glucagon management and to reduce the need for human supervision, we have implement a control algorithm for the insulin and glucagon pump to automate the delivery process. The control algorithm adapts the glucose metabolic rate and determine the appropriate amount of insulin or glucagon to be delivered into the body. Method that is followed is effective and efficient in maintaining the blood sugar level. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system is very easy and user friendly that makes it easier for the patient and doctor to use.

 title={A Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect allergies and Adverse Drugs Reactions based on internet of things}, 
  year={2010},   volume={},   number={},   pages={809-812},   abstract={The incidence of serious and fatal Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR) and harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients in worldwide hospitals is extremely high. Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.},   keywords={drug delivery systems;Internet;knowledge based systems;medical information systems;pharmaceutical intelligent information system;Internet-of-things;adverse drugs reaction;allergy interactions;near field communication;electronic health record;active ingredients;nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance;Pharmaceuticals;Intelligent systems;Information systems;Drugs;Internet;Hospitals;Artificial intelligence;Costs;Knowledge based systems;Cellular phones;Internet of things;Ambient Assisted Living;Ontology;NFC;Barcode;Rule-Based System},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470547},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

 title={Resource provisioning for IoT application services in smart cities}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={In the last years, traffic over wireless networks has been increasing exponentially, due to the impact of Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities. Current networks must adapt to and cope with the specific requirements of IoT applications since resources can be requested on-demand simultaneously by multiple devices on different locations. One of these requirements is low latency, since even a small delay for an IoT application such as health monitoring or emergency service can drastically impact their performance. To deal with this limitation, the Fog computing paradigm has been introduced, placing cloud resources on the edges of the network to decrease the latency. However, deciding which edge cloud location and which physical hardware will be used to allocate a specific resource related to an IoT application is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the IoT application service placement problem is proposed, which considers multiple optimization objectives such as low latency and energy efficiency. Solutions for the resource provisioning of IoT applications within the scope of Antwerp's City of Things testbed have been obtained. The result of this work can serve as a benchmark in future research related to placement issues of IoT application services in Fog Computing environments since the model approach is generic and applies to a wide range of IoT use cases.},   keywords={cloud computing;emergency services;integer programming;Internet of Things;linear programming;resource allocation;smart cities;ubiquitous computing;resource provisioning;IoT application services;smart cities;wireless networks;cloud resources;edge cloud location;IoT application service placement problem;IoT use cases;Internet of Things;emergency service;Fog computing paradigm;Integer Linear Programming;ILP;Antwerp City of Things testbed;Logic gates;Cloud computing;Smart cities;Bandwidth;Wireless communication;Edge computing;Optimization;IoT;Centralized management;Orchestration;ILP;Fog Computing},   doi={10.23919/CNSM.2017.8255974},   ISSN={2165-963X},   month={Nov},}

 title={DCCA: Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment for improved 802.11/802.15.4 coexistence}, 
  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={45-50},   abstract={The interaction between devices sharing the same frequency domain, but using different communication protocols, is an important issue prevalent to the Internet of Things (IoT). IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, protocols that overlap in applications such as home automation, health care and factory automation, is one such example. In these situations 802.11 networks are known to detrimentally interfere with 802.15.4 networks, degrading performance significantly. We show that the response to unsuccessful Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) is a large contributor to this degradation. Current responses do not distinguish between different transmission sources, employing the same response independent of the interferer type. However, as we show in this paper, it is beneficial to discriminate interferer types when performing CCA as this allows us to employ different strategies in handling occupied media. Our work considers in particular the low-power Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on the 802.15.4 standard. In such protocols, CCA is applied at the transmitter to arbitrate channel access, and also at the receiver for power efficient transmission detection. We present a protocol building block called Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (DCCA) which allows us to tailor the reaction to a busy channel depending on the nature of the interfering network type. We evaluate an implementation of DCCA for the ContikiMAC protocol on the Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP platform. The experimental evaluation shows that DCCA improves throughput of 802.15.4 networks in the presence of 802.11 networks significantly, ten-fold in some settings.},   keywords={access protocols;Internet of Things;radio receivers;radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels;wireless LAN;Zigbee;differentiating clear channel assessment;frequency domain;communication protocols;Internet of Things;IoT;IEEE 802.11 networks;IEEE 802.15.4, networks;CCA;low-power medium access control;ContikiMAC protocol;transmitter;receiver;power efficient transmission detection;protocol building block;interfering network;Maxfor MTM- CM5000MSP platform;DCCA;Interference;IEEE 802.15 Standards;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Receivers;Media Access Protocol;Transceivers;Wireless Sensor Networks;WiFi;802.15.4;CCA},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2014.6962148},   ISSN={2160-4886},   month={Oct},}

Traditional management technique is unable to scale up to such growth on M2M networks and services. In this context, we have developed an Autonomic M2M Management System that can learn to scale up to the personalized service-requirements. We have proposed and developed Psychic, an autonomic inference engine, that is capable to learn personalized service-recommendation by inferring service-usage from environmental (such as different locations, weather, time, etc.) and emotional Information(such as happiness, sadness, etc.) of users.

Therefore, we focus our research on collecting or monitoring real-time and remote data, which is commonly observed in the health care field of the IoT. In this research, there are difficulties to apply the conventional key distribution approaches during interactions when considering both security and efficiency. Moreover, when preserving personal privacy, anonymity is also important in key distribution processes. We design a system of real-time mobile services and the related security requirements in this paper, and apply a novel and interesting Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (IBKEM) to instantiate our system and achieve anonymous key distribution with only one-pass communication for mobile clients in batch.

However, data, as the core of both cloud computing and edge computing, is still owned by each stakeholder and rarely shared due to privacy concern and formidable cost of data transportation, which significantly limits Internet of Things (IoT) applications that need data input from multiple stakeholders (e.g., video analytics collects data from cameras owned by police department, transportation department, retailer stores, etc.). In this paper, we envision that in the era of IoT the demand of distributed big data sharing and processing applications will dramatically increase since the data producing and consuming are pushed to the edge of the network. Data processing in collaborative edge environment needs to fuse data owned by multiple stakeholders, while keeping the computation within stakeholders' data facilities. To attack this challenge, we propose a new computing paradigm, Firework, which is designed for big data processing in collaborative edge environment (CEE). Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of datasets and a set of functions, where the functions are privacy preserved and bound to the datasets. Firework targets to share data while ensuring data privacy and integrity for stakeholders. By pushing the data processing as close as to data sources, Firework also aims to avoid data movement from the edge of the network to the cloud and improve the response latency.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy;Internet of Things;distributed Big Data sharing;Firework;distributed Big Data processing;collaborative edge environment;cloud computing;multiple applications domains;actuators;sensors;edge computing;data transportation;Internet of Things;IoT;stakeholder data facility;CEE;geographic distributed data fusion;virtual shared data views;data privacy;data integrity;data sources},   doi={10.1109/HotWeb.2016.12},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In m-Healthcare, users' smartphones serve as bridges connecting their WBSNs and the healthcare center (HCC), i.e., send users' personal health information (PHI) collected by WBSNs to the HCC and receive the feedback. However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can realize privacy-preservation and achieve secure end-to-end communication for m-healthcare, and is suitable for resource-limited WBSNs.},   keywords={body sensor networks;data communication;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;mobile computing;smart phones;social networking (online);telecommunication security;smartphone;privacy preserving agent data transmission;mobile healthcare;wireless body sensor networks;resource limited WBSN;healthcare center;personal health information;PHI;HCC;medical services;m-healthcare;lightweight agent data transmission scheme;opportunistic social networks;protocol;secure end-to-end communication;security analysis;Smart phones;Data communication;Medical services;Data privacy;Privacy;Cryptography},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2015.7249496},   ISSN={1550-3607},   month={June},}

In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of leveraging recommendation algorithms, especially graph-based, to IoT. We propose a hyper-graph model for IoT systems in which each hyper-edge connects users, objects, and services. Next, we conduct experiment to analyze and explore correlations between performances of different algorithms on IoT Service Recommendation (IoTSRS) based on existing well known metrics.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={346-351},   abstract={Honey bees have held a critical role in agriculture and nutrition from the dawn of human civilisation. The most crucial role of the bee is pollination; the value of pollination dependant crops is estimated at € 155 billion per year with honey bees identified as the most important pollinator insect. It is clear that honey bees are a vitally important part of the environment which cannot be allowed to fall into decline. The project outlined in this paper uses Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology to monitor a beehive colony and collect key information about activity/environment within a beehive as well as its surrounding area. This project uses low power WSN technologies, including novel sensing techniques, energy neutral operation, and multi-radio communications; together with cloud computing to monitor the behaviour within a beehive. The insights gained through this activity could reduce long term costs and improve the yield of beekeeping, as well as providing new scientific evidence for a range of honey bee health issues. WSN is an emerging modern technology, key to the novel concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). Comprised of embedded sensing, computing and wireless communication devices, they have found applications in nearly every aspect of daily life. Informed by biologists' hypotheses, this work used existing, commercially available WSN platforms together with custom built systems in an innovative application to monitor honey bee health and activity in order to better understand how to remotly monitor the health and behaviour of the bees. Heterogeneous sensors were deployed, monitoring the honey bees in the hive (temperature, CO2, pollutants etc.). Weather conditions throughout the deployment were recorded and a relationship between the hive conditions and external conditions was observed. A full solution is presented including a smart hive, communication, and data aggregation and visualisation tools. Future work will focus on improving the energy performance of the system, introducing a more specialised set of sensors, implementing a machine learning algorithm to extract meaning from the data without human supervision; and securing additional deployments of the system.},   keywords={cloud computing;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics;wireless sensor networks;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;pollination dependant crops;beehive colony monitoring;low power WSN technologies;energy neutral operation;multiradio communications;cloud computing;Internet of Things;embedded sensing;weather conditions;hive conditions;machine learning algorithm;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Agriculture;Wireless Sensor Networks;3G mobile communication;Embedded systems;energy harvesting;Zigbee},   doi={10.1109/I2MTC.2015.7151292},   ISSN={1091-5281},   month={May},}

  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={4},   pages={340-354},   abstract={The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real-world objects (i.e. things). Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.},   keywords={data mining;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;information processing;abstraction techniques;Internet of Things;IoT;machine-interpretable data;human-understandable information data;sensor devices;information processing technique;machine-learning;semantic Web;data mining;pattern mining;information abstraction;Internet of things;Vectors;Data mining;Band-pass filters;Context;Information filters;Internet of Things;Data Abstraction;machine-learning;Semantic Web;Software Tools;Data abstraction;Internet of Things (IoT);machine-learning;semantic Web;software tools},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2411227},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

As these systems are generally battery operated, major research efforts focus on reducing power consumption, especially for communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the most power-hungry components of a WSN. Moreover, with the advent of energy-neutral systems, the emphasis has shifted toward research in microwatt (or even nanowatt) communication protocols or systems. A significant number of wake-up radio receiver (WUR) architectures have been proposed to reduce the communication power of WSN nodes. In this work, we present an optimized ultra-low power (nanowatt) wake-up receiver for use in WSNs, designed with low-cost off-the-shelf components. The wake-up receiver achieves power consumption of 152 nW (with -32 dBm sensitivity), sensitivity up to -55 dBm (with maximum power of 1,2 μW), latency from 8 μs, tunable frequency, and short commands communication. In addition, a low power solution, which includes addressing capability directly in the wake-up receiver, is proposed. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate low power consumption, functionality, and benefits of the design optimization compared with other solutions, as well as the benefits of addressing false positive (FP) outcomes reduction.},   keywords={protocols;radio receivers;wireless sensor networks;flexible low latency nanowatt wakeup radio receiver;wireless sensor networks;WSN;environmental monitoring;mobile health;home automation;Internet of Things;power consumption;radio transceiver;communication protocols;WUR architectures;WSN nodes;Receivers;Power demand;Sensitivity;Wireless sensor networks;Rectifiers;Transceivers;Optimization;Ultra Low Power;Wireless Sensor Networks;Power Optimization.;Nanowatt wake-up radio receiver (WUR);power optimization;ultra-low power;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2016.2524982},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={April},}

They share information with each other, with us and cloud based applications. These devices combine the physical and digital world and produce a huge amount of data to enhance the productivity of life, industries and society by providing smart services. IoT applications based on smart sensors open a new challenge which is the need of big data storage and huge computation power to provide real time data processing. IoT-Cloud solves such a problem since it provides a huge storage capacity. It also provides users on-demand access to resources at any place and any time.This work is designed to support any system where a huge data is generated and processed in real time such as a traffic monitoring system, a health system for obesity management using sensory and social data. We propose in this paper a new Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) that provides an intelligent data storage to minimize the latency of any input and output data requests in a massive data storage and a huge number of servers. To ensure a high critical data availability, our IaaS supplies Cloud servers with high monitoring, backup and recovery services in case of a server failure. The proposed approach is termed Reliable lOad Balancing Using Specialization for ioT critical application (ROBUST). We compared the latency of an output file request and the complexity of searching the replicated version of a critical data of ROBUST to a recent IaaS architecture called Load Balancing in the Cloud Using Specialization (LBCS) and the classic one.

Existing works used video monitoring and social network mining to find the potential anomalies in pilot's daily life. However, video monitoring suffers from the privacy problems and social network mining is computational complex. To solve the problems of existing works, we propose a novel pilot anomaly detection method using step-sensors. The key idea of this method is that the pilots step information reflects their daily behaviors, and it is also influenced by the behaviors of the pilots social networks; if a pilot step number is extremely different from his historical step numbers or the step numbers of his social networks, this would probably be an anomaly. We, therefore, use the step-sensor to collect pilots step information and use the cluster method to detect anomalies. Experiments are held on 65 pilot candidates, which are divided into two social groups. We collect their step information during 50 days. Using our proposed anomaly detection method, outliers can be successfully detected for further analysis. Our method is also free of privacy problem and is highly efficient.},   keywords={aerospace computing;behavioural sciences computing;data analysis;pattern clustering;abnormal behaviors;cluster method;pilot step number;pilots social networks;pilots step information;pilot anomaly detection method;step-sensors;civil aviation pilots;time 50 day;Social network services;Monitoring;Data mining;Privacy;Data models;Air safety;Smart phones;Pilot anomaly detection;step-sensors;clustering algorithm;civil aviation},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2717494},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

AAL systems are composed by several technologies: medical sensors and actuators, computer and mobile devices, Wireress Sensors Networks (WSN), computer networks, software infrastructure and applications. A comprehensive software infrastructure for AAL systems should use these technologies in an integrated manner and be able to cover scenarios involving several patient mobility level, patient locations, and levels of physical and cognitive abilities. The integration of AAL with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies expands the scope of these systems with the ability to connect various sensors and actuators, integrating them into a single network that serves the purpose of patient health monitoring. In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive Cloud based IoT softwre infrastructure for Ambient Assisted Living.

The challenge in this regard is to deliver energy to the RFID sensors that are embedded inside the structures in a manner that they can continuously sense for occurrence of any rare structural events. This paper summarizes some of the progress that has been made to-date in the area of self-powered RFID sensor networks within the concept of IoT. The core sensor uses a self-powering method which directly harvests computational and storage energy from slight strain-variations in the structure. The event signatures can then be stored on a non-volatile memory and remotely retrieved at a later period of time. In this “sense now retrieve later” paradigm, self-powering is only used for continuous sensing and data-logging of essential statistics; whereas, data retrieval and reconfiguration is achieved using a low-cost commercial RFID system. Another advantage of using a commercial RFID system for data retrieval is that the related standards and FCC compliance are well established and the technology can be easily integrated with other IoT network infrastructure.},   keywords={condition monitoring;data loggers;energy harvesting;information retrieval;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;structural engineering computing;wireless sensor networks;IoT network infrastructure;FCC compliance;low-cost commercial RFID system;data reconfiguration;data retrieval;data-logging;continuous sensing;sense now retrieve later paradigm;nonvolatile memory;strain-variations;computational energy harvesting;storage energy harvesting;self-powered RFID sensor networks;civil infrastructure;radio-frequency identification tagging technology;self-powered Internet-of-Things;infrastructural health monitoring;Strain;Mechanical sensors;Monitoring;Radiofrequency identification;Logic gates;Radio frequency;Fatigue prediction;infrastructural health monitoring;Internet-of-Things;NFC;piezo-floating gate sensor;RFID;self-powered sensor},   doi={10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7538983},   ISSN={2379-447X},   month={May},}

In this work we present a complete low-power wireless gas-sensing system based a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array, which is known to have several advantages such as high mass sensitivity, easy implementation of a multi-element structure, and high selectivity upon polymer coating. We took a holistic approach to designing the sensing elements and the custom integrated circuit (IC) as well as to operating the system, resulting in a small self-contained sensor node (38-mm diameter and 16-mm height). The chemical-sensing capability of the system has been validated with ethanol, achieving 120-ppb limit-of-detection (LOD) while the sensor array, including the IC and the power management unit (PMU), consuming 80-μW average power with power cycling by actively taking measurements for 3 s per minute. The presented system will eventually provide a ubiquitous tool to identify VOCs with the help of multivariate data analysis.},   keywords={Sensors;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Monitoring;Integrated circuits;Chemicals;Internet of Things (IoT);capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT);volatile organic compound (VOC);gravimetric sensor;multichannel gas sensor;front-end integrated circuit (IC);frequency counter.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2861330},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={254-258},   abstract={Serious games have been in focus of an increasing number of research efforts in the health domain over the last decade. Their maturity led researchers to increase their efforts on approaches and techniques that will facilitate the adoption of these games by older adults in their daily life. As real users' home is the desired destination of serious games, researchers have started taking them out of the lab settings. Towards this and aligned with the technology acceptance model, perceived ease of use is considered as a primary determinant affecting attitude towards ICT use. Therefore, contemporary mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, smart Tvs, etc.) can play essential role as means of delivering serious games. However, full body activity exergames seem to be more demanding in terms of transferring their technology from the well-established desktop applications to mobile and web technologies. Fortunately, web and mobile technology advancements can handle the emerged challenges. This paper presents the background of exergames on mobile devices and the technologies around them and gives insights on the available technologies that can be used to move full body exergames from desktop applications to web browsers. More specifically, this papers exhibits the future of gaming controllers in the Internet of Things domain and how this would accelerate full body exergames through mobile devices.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile handsets;serious games (computing);desktop applications;mobile devices;Internet of Things;serious games;full body activity exergames;Web technologies;Games;Engines;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Browsers;Graphics;Internet of things;exergames;Internet of Things;cross device;HTML5;game engines},   doi={10.1109/IMCTL.2015.7359598},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Mobile and wearable devices that have sensing and Internet access capabilities offer the opportunity of changing how medical services are delivered to the patients. The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet. A bare metal implementation of 6LoWPAN is made to satisfy the strict memory and processing power constraints of an ultra-low power embedded mote. An edge router and router stack of the 6LoWPAN are designed to demonstrate a full IPv6 accessibility for an embedded BAN supporting tree topology. The protocol stacks of the edge router and router are validated through successful connectivity tests and packet drop tests.

 title={Design and development of a smart weighing scale for beehive monitoring}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={In recent years monitoring of beehives through technology has become increasingly frequent in research and industry. This is due to a decline in beekeeping, and stagnant honey bee populations across the globe, due to, among other factors, pests and disease. Recent advances in the area of low power wireless sensor network technology can be applied to the beehive for a better understanding of the colony's condition. This combination of engineering and beekeeping has led to the emergence of Precision Beekeeping. One of the key metrics of the strength of a beehive is the weight of the colony. Changes in weight can accurately reflect the productivity of the colony, as well as its health and condition. This paper describes the development of a wireless platform weighing scales, for implementation as part of a smart beehive. A single point impact load cell was selected as the most appropriate load sensor and was integrated into the design of the scales. The final weighing system was interfaced via a high precision analogue to digital converter to an off-the-shelf processing platform enabled with a low power Zigbee radio, to allow for data transfer to the base station. An initial simulation of the scale's ability was carried out, using standard weights to simulate the brood chamber of a beehive and varying weight to mimic the production and consumption of honey. The results showed that the initial platform scale has a linear output characteristic. The analogue to digital converter was evaluated and the system was found to be able to detect changes in weight in the order of tens of grams. A power analysis of the system was also undertaken to confirm that the solution was suitable for remote, battery powered, deployments.},   keywords={analogue-digital conversion;balances;weighing;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee;smart beehive monitoring;stagnant honey bee population;low power wireless sensor network technology;colony condition;precision beekeeping;smart wireless platform weighing scale;single point impact load cell;load sensor;analogue to digital converter;low power Zigbee radio;data transfer;base station;linear output characteristics;power analysis;Strain;Wireless sensor networks;Weight measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Force;Computer architecture;Software;Precision weighing;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);Environmental monitoring;Internet of Things (IoT);Precision apiary;Biological and physical sensors},   doi={10.1109/ISSC.2015.7163763},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={741-746},   abstract={The recent trend of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things demands everyday objects to be IP addressable and Internet accessible. This brings forward the challenges of converting or mapping formerly isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to be IP compatible. IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is one of the first protocols which provide IP compatibility to low data rate WSNs. While 6LoWPAN is efficient for WSNs, there are other limitations such as different physical layers and radio interfaces which will break the information flow between heterogeneous IP-compatible networks and the Internet. In this paper, an integrated hardware/software solution is presented to bridge two heterogeneous 6LoWPAN networks. It is motivated by the necessity of merging a body area network and an environment control network in typical health monitoring applications of an intelligent environment. The unification is achieved through use of a physical serial bus, making a single hybrid router with the capability to route packets across both networks. The commonalities between two 6LoWPAN implementations allow highly efficient packet translation between two network stacks. Internet connectivity was added though use of an edge router, and allows each node to be addressed and accessed directly from anywhere on the Internet.},   keywords={biomedical communication;body area networks;computerised monitoring;embedded systems;Internet;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;routing protocols;ubiquitous computing;single hybrid route packet translation;physical serial bus;health monitoring application;environment control network;body area network;protocol;low power wireless personal area network;IPv6;wireless sensor network;WSN;IP addressable;Internet of Things application;integrating heterogeneous embedded 6LoWPAN network;Wireless sensor networks;Internet;Protocols;Routing;Wireless communication;Sensors;Hardware;wireless sensor networks;health monitoring;body area networks;intelligent environments;6LoWPAN},   doi={10.1109/ICSensT.2013.6727751},   ISSN={2156-8073},   month={Dec},}

To combat against these vulnerabilities, there is need to create an awareness of the potential risks of these devices and effective strategies are needed to be implemented to achieve a level of security defense. In this paper, the benefits of healthcare IoT system and the possible vulnerabilities that may result are presented. Also, we propose to develop solutions against these vulnerabilities by protecting mobile applications using obfuscation and return oriented programming techniques. These techniques convert an application into a form which makes difficult for an adversary to interpret or alter the code for illegitimate purpose.

The trend with this new paradigm where smart embedded devices, people, and systems are connected, is that over the next few years we could see a shift in the notion of what it means to be "on the Internet". In this context, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology is an essential component of IoT because it consists of a collection of sensor nodes connected through wireless channels, capable of providing digital interfaces to the real-world things. Moreover, as it occurs in IoT, specific WSN applications can be applied to a wide variety of domains like health, agriculture, logistics, wearable computing and others. However, recent works considered as WSN applications are being called as IoT applications without distinguishing the new features that characterize this denomination. Hence, in this paper we propose to contrast IoT and WSN from a conceptual overview, aiming to find out the relationship between them and to highlight their differences in terms of (i) the thesaurus proposed by IEEE, ACM and UNESCO, (ii) by performing a chronological review of the concepts since these terms appeared, (iii) the definition issued by reference organizations and researchers, and (iv) the main application requirements addressed by reference architectures proposed for both fields of study.},   keywords={Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;wireless sensor network;IoT;smart embedded devices;WSN technology;wireless channels;digital interfaces;thesaurus;Wireless sensor networks;Machine-to-machine communications;Internet of Things;Thesauri;Middleware;Context;Conceptual overview;Internet of things;Wireless Sensor Network},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.66},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

This paper focuses on current wireless-communication technologies, including cellular-communication technologies (4G, 5G), low-power wide-area (LPWA) technologies with an unlicensed spectrum (LoRa, SigFox), and other LPWA technologies supported by 3GPP working with an authorized spectrum (EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT).

To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition, to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption, we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control. The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies. As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method.

If any abnormality occurs, the system sends alert messages to the mobile phones as well as monitoring units which containing information about abnormality to some predefined instructions programmed in the microcontroller. Also it is important to keep an eye on transformer health when operator is not present at transformer site, so we are introducing embedded system named as two way communication systems between transformer and operator.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of variation in the time interval between consecutive heart beats. HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;diseases;electronic messaging;file servers;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;protocols;telemedicine;wireless LAN;Zigbee;IoT-based remote HRV monitoring system;hypertensive patients;heart rate variability;HRV analysis;cardiovascular disease;diabetic mellitus;disease states;HRV parameters;Internet of Things technology;Wireless Zigbee-based pulse sensor;short message service;WiFi technology;Zigbee technology;MQTT protocol;Heart rate variability;Monitoring;Servers;ZigBee;Biomedical monitoring;Hypertension;Heart Rate Variability (HRV);Hypertension;Cardiovascular disease;Diabetic mellitus;Internet of Things (IoT);Zigbee;Transport Level Security (TLS);Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)},   doi={10.1109/ICCCSP.2017.7944086},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

In order to ensure the availability of target systems, prognostic and health management develops as an important system to assess the current health state and estimate the future health state based on modern Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and cloud computing technologies. The early design of PHM systems requires system engineering methodology to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of systems. However, as the complexity grows, there may be some misunderstanding in specification that are not obvious and it is hard to perform verification and evaluation in a more intuitive way. In order to enhance the intuitiveness and reduce the misunderstanding in early development stage, we present a visual model-based framework to simulate and evaluate the cloud-based prognostics and health management systems. The framework proposes a three-abstraction-layer hierarchical architecture to represent distributed data sources and cloud-based PHM service center. The design of the framework is based on system modeling language and allows flexible algorithm implementations of function modules. The simulation of framework is visualized through the animated behavior diagrams.

To this end, DC-DC converters with ultra-low start-up voltage, full integration and high efficiency in a wide input voltage range are required. In this paper a novel one-input, two-output DC-DC converter circuit is introduced. Low-power output provides 0.8-3.5 V with maximum load current of 3.5 μA starting up from 98 mV input. High-power output is turned on by an ultra-low-power voltage detector when input voltage reaches 150 mV, to provide 0.8-2.4 V with maximum load current of 200 μA. The circuit has been implemented in UMC 180-nm CMOS technology. Maximum simulated system efficiency is 34% at 0.2 V input. Low-power output meets the real time power demand of sensing, data processing and data storage blocks of IoT/Wearable devices, while high-power output provides sufficient power for data transmission, enabling batteryless operation.},   keywords={biomedical electronics;CMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;energy harvesting;health care;Internet of Things;low-power electronics;energy harvesting;batteryless IoT/Wearable devices;IoT smart nodes;ultra-low start-up voltage;two-output DC-DC converter circuit;maximum load current;ultra-low-power voltage detector;voltage 98.0 mV;current 3.5 muA;voltage 150.0 mV;current 200.0 muA;voltage 0.8 V to 3.5 V;Charge pumps;Oscillators;Load modeling;Detectors;Inductors;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={398-406},   abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},   keywords={biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;Internet of Things;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;Analog Signal compression;multiplexing technique;traffic data;IoT applications;power consumption;IoT devices;encoding method;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;analog domain;AJSCC device;analog encoding;FPMM receiver;joint modulation;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;multisignal compression method;FPMM technique;healthcare Internet of Things;IoT scalability;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;power saving;SNR operating region;miss detection rate;mean square error;Medical services;Sensors;Power demand;Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Shannon Mapping;Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.62},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems.

  year={2016},   volume={36},   number={6},   pages={16-24},   abstract={Despite the promising applicability of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as for home automation and health monitoring, it is laborious to develop an IoT application, because programmers should explicitly manipulate communication for shared data across heterogeneous distributed IoT devices. Recent proposals simplify the communication management with graphical views or language extensions but still require programmers to explicitly manage communication. To liberate programmers from explicit communication management, this article revisits heterogeneous distributed shared memory (HDSM) for IoT devices and proposes a compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework, called IoT-HDSM. The framework's compiler unifies heterogeneous memory layouts of different IoT devices, and the runtime system provides a shared memory view for the devices. To support lightweight devices that cannot execute the runtime, the compiler automatically inserts explicit communication instructions into the IoT application. Moreover, to efficiently control concurrent memory accesses without locks, the authors also propose a new annotation called the memory branch, which provides a memory snapshot for each device. This article describes the implementation of three IoT services with IoT-HDSM and shows that IoT-HDSM simplifies shared data management without harming QoS.},   keywords={computer network management;concurrency control;distributed shared memory systems;Internet of Things;program compilers;heterogeneous distributed shared memory;lightweight Internet of Things devices;communication management;compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework;IoT-HDSM;heterogeneous memory layouts;concurrent memory access control;memory branch;shared data management;Internet of things;Heterogeneous networks;Distributed processing;Memory management;Home automation;Biomedical monitoring;Runtime;Internet of Things;heterogeneous distributed shared memory;memory branch},   doi={10.1109/MM.2016.103},   ISSN={0272-1732},   month={Nov},}

This paper presents a case study on the conceptual architecture design in such an environment, and co-develops the architecture and the domain solution to improve prototyping rapidness. First, on applying systems thinking and technologies, during architecting, we include the tasks of meeting both functional and performance requirements especially with respect to analytics, in a single architecture description framework. Second, we study a domain-specific issue, where un-attempted methods must be researched, and provide a solution that re-uses existing system elements, through which the mutual impacts between the information from both architecture and domain solutions are shown. Practical and important issues including benefits, standards, and implementations are also explored as part of the required tasks for architecting.

People have made their life more complex and busy. In their busy schedule they don't bother for their health. Hence, we have developed a project titled “Smart Health Band”. The purpose of this project is to autonomously monitor the health of the person. This health band can sense body temperature and pulse rate of a person. Upon sensing the temperature and pulse rate, the data is to be sent to a cloud named “Thingspeak”. Here, a graph displays the sensed temperature and pulse rate. This data is then fetched on a mobile application. Hence, user can see the pulse rate and body temperature by using the application.

As a result, their quality of sleep decreases dramatically affecting not only their sleep but also the quality of their day to day life. Waiting lists for receiving a professional diagnose can be very long leaving the patient unable to take precautions to improve their sleep quality. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based sleep quality monitoring pillow that tracks temperature, humidity, luminosity, sound, and vibration. The pillow is able to forward the gathered information to a server through a wireless router with a static NAT configuration. Subsequently, user and medical staff can obtain the information and determine their quality of sleep. Furthermore, they are able to change the actions performed by the AAL system and the respective thresholds of the cushion. Architecture and algorithm of the system list circumstances that can reduce sleep quality and the actions intelligent devices perform to improve the sleep quality of the user.

Maneuver anticipation supplements existing Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by anticipating mishaps and giving drivers more opportunity to respond to road circumstances proactively. The capacity to sort the driver conduct is extremely beneficial for advance driver assistance system (ADAS). Deep learning solutions would further be an endeavor of for driving conduct recognition. A technique for distinguishing driver's conduct is imperative to help operative mode transition between the driver and independent vehicles. We propose a novel approach of dissecting driver's conduct by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and a combination of Convolutional Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that would give better results in less response time.

In smart community, residents manage their home appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.},   keywords={cooperative systems;data privacy;home automation;Internet;Internet of Things;wireless LAN;smart community;efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme;Internet bandwidth;pervasive Internet access;cost;EPS;WiFi bandwidth;proximity score;location privacy preservation;multiple pseudonym techniques;privacy analyses;identity privacy;communication efficiency;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;smart community;privacy preservation;cooperative network},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2013.2263793},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={Oct},}

 title={An Ensemble Intrusion Detection Technique based on proposed Statistical Flow Features for Protecting Network Traffic of Internet of Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly significant role in our daily activities, connecting physical objects around us into digital services. In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors’ data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.},   keywords={Protocols;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Botnet;Temperature sensors;TCPIP;Network Intrusion Detection system (NIDS);IoT;ensemble learning;statistical flow features;botnet.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2871719},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

The synthesis of concurrent systems implies the analysis of a vast state space that often requires computationally expensive methods. This work presents new methods for the synthesis of speed-independent circuits from a new perspective, overcoming both the analysis and computation complexity bottlenecks. The circuits are specified by free-choice signal transition graphs (STGs), a subclass of interpreted Petri nets. The synthesis approach is divided into the following steps: correctness, binary coding, implementability conditions, and logic synthesis. Each step is efficiently implemented by applying a set of structural techniques that analyze STGs without explicitly enumerating the underlying state space. Experimental results show that circuits can be generated from specifications that exceed in several orders of magnitude the largest STGs ever synthesized-with over 10/sup 27/ states. Computation times are also dramatically reduced.

However, the advantages offered by the IoT platforms come with the burden of big data and its associated challenges in terms of computing complexity, bandwidth availability and power consumption. This paper proposes a solution to tackle both privacy issues and big data transmission by incorporating the theory of compressive sensing (CS) and a simple, yet, efficient identification mechanism using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as a biometric trait. Moreover, the paper presents the hardware implementation of the proposed solution on a system on chip (SoC) platform with an optimized architecture to further reduce hardware resource usage. First, we investigate the feasibility of compressing the ECG data while maintaining a high identification quality. The obtained results show a 98.88% identification rate using only a compression ratio of 30%.

This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.},   keywords={Bayes methods;behavioural sciences;data mining;health care;home automation;intelligent sensors;intelligent structures;Internet of Things;matrix decomposition;mobile computing;pattern clustering;vectors;Bayesian nominal matrix factorization;activity pattern mining;Internet of Things;IoT;smart sensor technologies;data-driven paradigm;human behavioral analysis;smart home;health care;senior adult well-being;sensor data collection;nominal data matrix decomposition;basis vectors;hierarchical probabilistic model;ordinal matrix factorization;Bayesian lasso;human interpretation;basis vector reconstruction accuracy;daily activity routine analysis;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Manganese;Smart homes;Robustness;Nominal matrix factorization;probabilistic hierarchical model;Bayesian inference;routine pattern discovery},   doi={10.1109/WI.2016.0054},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={Elastic Management of Physical Spaces and Objects in Multi-Hospital Environments}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={33-38},   abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).},   keywords={biomedical equipment;client-server systems;cloud computing;decision making;health care;medical information systems;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;virtual machines;Web services;object elastic management;physical space elastic management;multihospital environments;medical treatment;health equipments;elastic multihospital management model;EMH model;cloud elasticity facility;distributed framework;multiple healthcare institutions;centralized management control center;virtual machines;real-time decision making;RFID;radio-frequency identification sensor tracking technology;client-server Web service;motion detection;Hospitals;Cloud computing;Elasticity;Radiofrequency identification;Databases;Hospitals;Performance;Cloud;Elasticity},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.33},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={67},   number={7},   pages={1543-1554},   abstract={Sensors are used to determine a variety of health and security parameters. Pressure mats and camera analysis are frequently used to determine a person's chair posture. Measurement of parameters can be derived from a variety of different sensor types, which may already be present in an environment. This paper presents the use of the concept of “sensory substitution,” where a sensor designed to measure Quantity X is used to measure Quantity Y. The concept is used to enable alternative sensing techniques for medical and security applications, such as determining chair occupancy, postural shift times, and even current postural state, without using cameras or pressure sensors. Specifically, the postural state of a subject is determined in a laboratory study using various arrays of both temperature sensors and acoustic sensors. This method can be used standalone, can augment other sensors, or can validate data from pressure or visual-based systems. These alternative sensors could also be used for other aspects of smart infrastructure. The system was tested with different types and styles of furniture, including chairs, armrests, cushions, and beds. A least mean square algorithm was deployed to remove noises enabling acoustic posture detection. Using a thresholding algorithm, postural changes are then identified using audio. In a controlled environment, over 90% of postural change events were detected. Thus, the paper shows two alternative instrumentation and measurement methods to determine occupancy, postural change timings, and even posture states of a person in a chair.},   keywords={acoustic transducers;audio signal processing;least mean squares methods;medical signal processing;temperature sensors;acoustic posture detection;postural changes;postural change events;postural change timings;posture states;pressure mats;camera analysis;alternative sensing techniques;medical security applications;chair occupancy;postural shift times;current postural state;temperature sensors;acoustic sensors;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Pressure measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Acoustic;adaptive signal processing;Internet of Things (IoT);least mean square (LMS);low cost;normalized least mean square (NLMS);posture;pressure;sensors;smart environment;temperature sensor;unobtrusive sensors},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2018.2795158},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={July},}

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},   keywords={authorisation;electronic health records;granular computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic matching;semantic rule reasoning;personal health record;role-based access control;attribute-based access control;granular security concepts;ontology;social care providers;health care providers;granularity levels;patient-specified authorization policies;RABAC;local security policies;data access;patient-centered model;healthcare information systems;information storage;healthcare professional component;health information transmission;medical device component;nonhealthcare providers;social information collection;health information collection;nonhealthcare component;patient data;IOT;Internet of things;cloud computing;virtual PHR authorization system;Authorization;Ontologies;Medical services;Cloud computing;Semantics;Filtering},   doi={10.1109/BHI.2014.6864307},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are engineered solutions obtained through the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components. Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets. Some considerations about major measurement challenges that the CPS self-awareness feature poses in maintenance and troubleshooting operations are then drawn. Concluding remarks are finally reported.},   keywords={cyber-physical systems;industrial engineering;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;networking technologies;industrial manufacturing;networking issues;cyber-physical systems;computational algorithms;CPS technology;measurement issues;Sensors;Manufacturing;Software reliability;Robustness;Maintenance engineering;Computer architecture;Cyber Physical System;Industrial Manufacturing;Measurement and Networking;Maintenance;Troubleshooting Internet-of-Things;Analytics},   doi={10.1109/IWMN.2017.8078384},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment.

Crucial events and activities responsible for these changes often go unnoticed. This paper introduces healthcare event and action logging (HEAL) which automatically and unobtrusively monitors and reports on events and activities that occur in a medical ICU room. HEAL uses a multimodal distributed camera network to monitor and identify ICU activities and estimate sanitation-event qualifiers. At the core is a novel approach to infer person roles based on<italic>semantic interactions</italic>, a critical requirement in many healthcare settings where individuals’ identities must not be identified. The proposed approach for activity representation identifies contextual aspects basis and estimates aspect weights for proper action representation and reconstruction. The flexibility of the proposed algorithms enables the identification of people roles by associating them with inferred interactions and detected activities. A fully working prototype system is developed, tested in a mock ICU room and then deployed in two ICU rooms at a community hospital, thus offering unique capabilities for data gathering and analytics. The proposed method achieves a role identification accuracy of 84% and a backtracking role identification of 79% for obscured roles using interaction and appearance features on real ICU data.

In order to make it possible and to facilitate transmission of IPv6 packets over low powered networks, 6LoWPAN [9,11] has been introduced. 6LoWPAN incorporates an adaptation layer between network and data link layers. Two routing schemes are used in 6LoWPAN depending on which layer takes routing, forwarding decisions. If adaptation layer takes the decision, then it is called mesh under, whereas if the network layer is involved, then the scheme is route over. In this paper, we present a comparative study of these two schemes. Various performance metrics, such as average round-trip time delay, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio are compared and suitability of the two schemes are analyzed for a Sensor-Grid infrastructure.

  year={2012},   volume={16},   number={1},   pages={1-5},   abstract={In the last decade, the seminal term and concept of “m-health” were first defined and introduced in this transactions as “mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for healthcare.” Since that special section, the m-health concept has become one of the key technological domains that reflected the key advances in remote healthcare and e-health systems. The m-health is currently bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare delivery and technology sectors. From the wireless communications perspective, the current decade is expected to bring the introduction of new wireless standards and network systems with true mobile broadband and fast internet access healthcare services. These will be developed around what is currently called the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. In this editorial paper, we will introduce the new and novel concept of 4G health that represents the long-term evolution of m-health since the introduction of the concept in 2004. The special section also presents a snapshot of the recent advances in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the evolved m-health perspective. It will also present some of the concepts that can go beyond the traditional “m-health ecosystem” of the existing systems. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging healthcare delivery concept.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Medical services;Mobile computing;Telemedicine;Long Term Evolution;WiMAX;Personal area networks;Body area network (BAN);e-health;m-health;Internet of Things (IOT);long term evolution (LTE);medical sensors;personal area network (PAN);telemedicine;WiMAX;4G mobile technologies},   doi={10.1109/TITB.2012.2183269},   ISSN={1089-7771},   month={Jan},}

Household appliances communicate to each other and to local energy supply systems (e.g. photo voltaic or wind) to optimize energy usage and costs, order run out groceries independently and monitor our state of health. Personal robots overtake obnoxious tasks for us, entertain our kids and us, and surveil our homes against any hazard. Every object in the future factories is able to exchange data, work pieces may choose discretely their optimal process route and machines report maintenance issues betimes. And last, but not least, wearable electronics will accompany us in watches to control our vital functions, in shoes to detect our pace and in glasses to display essential information.

It envisions IoT objects and devices to have social interactions with each other autonomously, cooperate with other agents, and exchange information with human users and surrounding computing devices. These objects are able to sense/actuate, store, and interpret information in an opportunistic and loosely coupled fashion. The objects in the SIoT paradigm can exhibit multiple forms of social relationships derived from their collaborative activities or functional, temporal and spatial dependencies to meet a particular need of human users, which signify the difference between the SIoT domain to that of social-based mobile networks or sensor networks. The social interaction among the SIoT objects contribute a huge volume of data to be processed and used by various applications such as social VANET, social connected health, SIoT-based recommendation service, traffic service, policing, energy management etc, in the area of Smart Cities, Smart Homes, Smart Grid, and Smart Factories to satisfy human needs, interests, and objectives.

IoT supports ubiquitous information exchange and content sharing among smart devices with little or no human intervention, is a key enabler for various applications. Smart IoT cannot be simply regarded as an upgrade of current IoT by just adding to or replacing sensors/actuators/RFID tags in smart devices. It should be redesigned from the physical layer to the application layer in a bottom-up way. While the traditional-sense IoT paradigm, including the present narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) proposal, aims to provide low-rate, short-range, and relatively stationary connections to the wireless sensors and/or RFID tags, the new architecture is expected to support higher data rates, longer communication ranges, and more flexible mobility for smart devices, with the assistance of some new caching, communication, and computing technologies. These also enable smart IoT to be applied to a broader application area including crowdsensing, crowdsourcing, AR/VR, UAV, and so on, to realize smarter cities, grid, and health, and more intelligent transportation systems. Fully utilizing the communication, computing, caching, and security technologies can essentially complement the current development of IoT.The resulting new structure may have a wider application over current infrastructure-based cellular networks and traditional sensor-based networks by adopting all these features.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Internet of Things;Smart devices;Wireless sensor networks;Resource management;Privacy;Information exchange},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.8466348},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={SEPTEMBER},}

Differentiated from 4G, a benefit offered by 5G is much more than the increased maximum throughput. It aims to involve and benefit from many current technical advances including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the IIoT integrates many heterogeneous networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Mobile Communication Networks (3G/4G/LTE/5G), Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and wearable health care systems, it is critical to design self-organizing and smart protocols for heterogeneous ad hoc networks in various IoT applications, such as cyber-physical systems, cloud computing for heterogeneous ad hoc networks, large-scale sensor networks, data acquisition from distributed smart devices, green communication and applications, environmental monitoring and control, etc. Moreover, based on the survey conducted by the World Health Organization, the world will lack 12.9 million healthcare workers by 2035. Hence, it is important to develop wearable healthcare systems to perform self-health monitoring. In general, wearable healthcare systems demands low power consumption and high measurement accuracy. Smart technologies including green electronics, green radios, fuzzy neural approaches and intelligent signal processing techniques play important roles in the developments of the wearable healthcare systems. Therefore, this special issue provides a forum to discuss the recent advances on 5G and beyond mobile technologies and applications for IIoT.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Wearable computers;Wireless communication;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Informatics;Long Term Evolution},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2823311},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={June},}

The first is about to approach the market as testified by recent demonstration activities carried on by leading car makers (mostly from Japan). The second is mostly driven by the Internet of Things (loT) perspective evolution that requires energizing plenty of contactless devices, often non-precisely referred in space.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},   keywords={cognition;health care;home computing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;cognitive health assessment;IoT;signal processing;machine learning techniques;technology-guided algorithmic methodology;smart home health service systems;Alzheimers patients;retirement community centers;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917641},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In recent years, IoT has become a fashionable jargon in the information and communication discipline. Despite the huge enthusiasm, most IoT deployments are restricted to dealing with automatic collection of data that has so far been collected manually. As such, for many people, connecting to the IoT does not bring any tangible benefit. In addition, connecting to the Internet of Things require special knowledge which common people do not possess. We believe that in order to be successful, the evolution of IoT should emphasize on participation of common people. Also, that the power of this technology will be more meaningfully exploited if it can be deployed in gathering the information that has so far been hidden around us. With such objectives, currently, we are working on developing a new generation IoT platform that we name as KIBAN. In addition, we have been conducting experiments on novel applications of IoT in the domains of food, agriculture, health and welfare. The speech will introduce KIBAN and such applications along with some projections into the future.},   keywords={Internet of Things;human centric evolution;IoT deployments;generation IoT platform;Internet of Things;KIBAN;Internet of Things;Agriculture;Speech;Biographies;Information science;Computer science;Research and development},   doi={10.1109/ICCITECHN.2017.8281859},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={xi-xiv},   abstract={In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of D<sup>n</sup>y for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.},   keywords={},   doi={10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

  year={2013},   volume={61},   number={6},   pages={2523-2523},   abstract={Call for Papers: In the recent years, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) related technologies experienced a great growth. With the introduction in 2010 of the Qj standard, many wireless rechargeable devices appeared on the market, calling for solution of several classes of problems ranging from EMC, health compliance, and power efficiency, representing a stimulating field of activity for scientists and researchers. Beside this leading application area, great interest is being received by two other application categories: Electric Vehicles (EV) and long range electromagnetic transmission of energy. The first is about to approach the market as testified by recent demonstration activities carried on by leading car makers (mostly from Japan).

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={1},   pages={64-63},   abstract={A new industrial revolution is underway, driven by the integration of creative digital technologies into large-scale physical systems, creating intelligent systems that can operate more efficiently and improve quality of life. The best-known example of such an intelligent system is the smart grid. The same technologies that enabled the smart grid are being applied to many other types of physical systems. Intelligent systems are rapidly emerging in transportation, buildings, other energy infrastructures (e.g., gas, oil, and water), manufacturing, emergency response, and health care. Of course, the smart grid provides an essential foundation since all types of intelligent systems depend on reliable and high-quality electricity to power their operation. Various writers use terms such as cyberphysical systems,” “industrial Internet,” and the “Internet of Things (IOT )” to refer to what we are calling “intelligent systems.” While these terms do not necessarily mean the same thing, they all bring to mind a common set of enabling technologies that are making physical systems intelligent.},   keywords={Intelligent systems;Smart grids;Systems operation;Productivity;Industries;Technological innovation},   doi={10.1109/MELE.2015.2509904},   ISSN={2325-5897},   month={March},}

With the introduction in 2010 of the Qj standard, many wireless rechargeable devices appeared on the market, calling for solution of several classes of problems ranging from EMC, health compliance, and power efficiency, representing a stimulating field of activity for scientists and researchers. Beside this leading application area, great interest is being received by two other application categories: Electric Vehicles (EV) and long range electromagnetic transmission of energy. The first is about to approach the market as testified by recent demonstration activities carried on by leading car makers (mostly from Japan). The second is mostly driven by the Internet of Things (loT) perspective evolution that requires energizing plenty of contactless devices, often non-precisely referred in space. It is clear, even from this very synthetic description of the WPT scenario, how WPT actually is an inclusive, multidiscipline field of different but dependent researches.

 title={Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities}, 
  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2-3},   abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain and the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},   keywords={Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;smart data;Big Data;personalized digital health;metadata;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;semantic perception;ontologies;domain models;vocabularies;semantic interoperability;continuous semantics;Big Data volume;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity},   doi={10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

The idea of an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is currently captivating both technologists and society at large. Although IoT techniques have their roots in ideas that are decades old, their increasingly widespread deployments have made them a hot topic these days, frequently discussed and hyped. As many as 50B networked devices are envisioned by 2020, and proponents of IoTs see a world where embedded sensing and control techniques help vehicle traffic flow more smoothly, where environmental sensing and data analysis facilitates better use of natural resources like water, and where personalized health monitoring helps individuals improve their quality of life. On the other hand, properly addressing policy concerns around security and privacy may play a role in IoT's adoption and success. My talk will discuss key technology and policy challenges for future IoT applications and devices. Overall, I will be drawing from both technical experiences and trends, as well as from policy perspectives gained during a one year fellowship doing technology policy within the U. S.

First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;Internet of Things;radio links;security of data;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things security;IoT security;wireless sensor networking;machine-2-machine communication;M2M communication;wireless bodyworn sensing device security;health infrastructure;medical applications;symmetric spatiotemporal characteristics;wireless link;link fingerprint matching;data session},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457124},   ISSN={},   month={March},}
