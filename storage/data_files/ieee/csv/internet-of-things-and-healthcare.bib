 title={Automatic Ocular Disease Screening and Monitoring Using a Hybrid Cloud System}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={263-268},   abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;image classification;Internet of Things;medical image processing;hybrid cloud system;healthcare IT systems;advanced image and data analysis techniques;medical devices;cloud-based system;advanced pattern classification algorithms;ophthalmologists;disease detection;ocular disease screening;Diseases;Cloud computing;Retina;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Internet of Things;healthcare;ocular diseases;disease screening;computer aided diagnosis;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.68},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;software defined networking;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;health monitoring systems;Internet of Things;e-healthcare sensor network load-balancing scheme;hospital remote-monitoring network planning;SDN-SFC;load-balancing mechanism;network congestion;hospital networks;relaying real-time information;remote medical sensors;Conferences;IEC;IEC Standards;Noise measurement;Cloud e-Healthcare;Wireless Body Area Network;Software-Defined Networking},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210833},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Inability of the physician to have continuous insight into different data, fracture healing process, patient&amp;#x2019;s behavior and environmental factors could be considered as a reason for these complications. In this paper, we propose the improvement of a fixation device design, which implements paradigms of aware, sensing, smart and active devices and thus, enables real-time monitoring of bone fracture healing. Such a design is considered as IoT gateway, capable to classify occurrences of events and milestones in patient recovery process, based on the data from different sensors, and report those to the specialists or related Healthcare Information System.

How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.},   keywords={alarm systems;biomedical communication;Global Positioning System;gyroscopes;health care;patient monitoring;radiocommunication;sensors;smart phones;smartphones;healthcare;jogging;walking;travelling;standing;GPS coordinates;gyroscope;portable sensors;wireless communication;momentary state of health;fluid;calories;bodily position;ambulance;patient condition;GPS positions;life-saving information;driver indisposition;steering wheel;pedals;hazard warning flasher;measured data;pulse counter;sphygmograph;defibrillator;Smart phones;Sensors;Global Positioning System;Diseases;Vehicles;Fluids;Home appliances;smartphone;healthcare;save live},   doi={10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.90},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={335-341},   abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback. This data, which pertains to bicortical drilling conditions, will provide teaching surgeons and their surgical residents evaluation tools beyond those currently available.},   keywords={biological tissues;biomedical education;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;surgery;Internet-of-Things;biomedical development;surgery;healthcare professional training;hard tissues;soft tissues;medical instruments;program insurance;bicortical drilling conditions;Surgery;Hardware;Training;Software;Fixtures;Research and development management;Conferences;Biomedical;Surgical Training;Femoral Surgery;Bicortical;Internet of Things;Model-Driven Development;Software Engineering;Hardware Engineering;Systems Engineering;Cognitive Computing},   doi={10.1109/TEMSCON.2017.7998399},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The Internet is becoming a major part of everyone's daily life. Data representing trustful and suspicious activities is continuously generated and stored everywhere at an unprecedented scale. This extremely large data, which is known as Big Data, may contain critical and helpful information that can be used in detecting, and in many cases, preventing illegal activities, crimes and more importantly terror attacks.

In this paper, we investigate a voice pathology detection system using deep learning on the mobile healthcare framework. A mobile multimedia healthcare framework is also designed. In the voice pathology detection system, voices are captured using smart mobile devices. Voice signals are processed before being fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer).

We perform an exploratory analysis considering big data coming from sensors installed in Lokomat, i.e., one of the major robotic rehabilitation devices, in order to study the data model and the predictors that will allow clinical operators to forecast the best treatment personalizing the therapy. Data analysis proves that there are moderate correlations among features referring to stance and swing biofeedbacks of hip and knee. From the analytical point of view, these values may approximate the stance and swing phases of knee and hip. This can be compared with the normal gait pattern of healthy individuals, so as to point out those patients having a closer normal ambulation.

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={8},   pages={33-39},   abstract={Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.},   keywords={electronic money;Internet of Things;mobile computing;mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems;future mobile Internet-of-Things systems;decentralized data management framework;Bitcoin digital currency;blockchain applications;resource-limited mobile devices;mobile services;edge computing resource management;proof-of-work puzzles;multiple access mobile edge computing;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Data mining;Bitcoin;Servers;Heterogeneous networks;Internet of Things;Multiaccess communication},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1701095},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={August},}

Several IIoT applications such as the ones related to healthcare systems are expected to widely utilize the evolving 5G technology. This 5G-inspired IIoT paradigm in healthcare applications enables the users to interact with various types of sensors via secure wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs). Users of 5G networks should interact with each other in a seamless secure manner. And thus, security richness is highly coveted for the real time wireless sensor network systems. Asking users to verify themselves before every interaction is a tedious, time-consuming process that disrupts inhabitants' activities, and degrades the overall healthcare system performance. To avoid such problems, we propose a context-sensitive seamless identity provisioning (CSIP) framework for the IIoT. CSIP proposes a secure mutual authentication approach using hash and global assertion value to prove that the proposed mechanism can achieve the major security goals of the WMSN in a short time period.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;biomedical communication;cryptography;health care;Internet of Things;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;context-sensitive access;embedded sensors;IIoT applications;healthcare systems;evolving 5G technology;secure wireless medical sensor networks;seamless secure manner;security richness;healthcare system performance;context-sensitive seamless identity provisioning framework;secure mutual authentication approach;security goals;industrial Internet of Things healthcare applications;5G-inspired IIoT paradigm;5G networks;real time wireless sensor network systems;CSIP;global assertion value;Authentication;Intelligent sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Cloud computing;Mutual authentication;security;wireless medical sensor network (WMSN)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2808190},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={June},}

However, IoT raises some important questions and also introduces new challenges for the security of systems and processes and the privacy of individuals, such as their location and movements and so on. In this paper, at first, we propose a distributed IoT system architecture. Subsequently, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme, which can ensure some of the notable properties, such as sensor anonymity, sensor untraceability, resistance to replay attacks, cloning attacks, and so on.

To carry the big healthcare data ema nating from the plethora of bi 0-sens ors and machines in the IoT sensing plane to the central cloud, next generation high-speed delivery networks are essential. On the other hand, once the IoT data are delivered to the cloud, the massive IoT healthcare data are processed and analyzed em-ploying the state-of-the-art analytics tools such as deep machine learning and so forth. However, given the explosion of big data (from various sources in addition to the healthcare data), the delivery network as well the cloud may experience network and computational congestion, respectively. This may impact the realtime analytics of the healthcare data, e.g., critical for in-house patients and senior citizens aging at home. To address this issue, the emerging IoT edge analytics concept can be regarded as a promising solution to process the big healthcare data close to the source. For larg e-s cale IoT dep loym ents, this fu nctio nality is critical because of the sheer volumes of Data being generated.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is now transitioning from theory to practice. This means that a lot of data will be generated and the management of this data is going to be a big challenge. To transform IoT into reality and build upon realistic and more useful services, better resource management is required at the perception layer. In this regard, Fog computing plays a very vital role. With the advent of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) and remote healthcare and monitoring, quick response time and latency minimization are required. However, the receiving nodes have a very fluctuating behavior in resource consumption especially if they are mobile. Fog, a localized cloud placed close to the underlying IoTs, provides the means to cater such issues by analyzing the behavior of the nodes and estimating resources accordingly. Similarly, Service Level Agreement (SLA) management and meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements also become issues. In this paper, we devise a methodology, referred to as MEdia FOg Resource Estimation (MeFoRE), to provide resource estimation on the basis of service give-up ratio, also called Relinquish Rate (RR), and enhance QoS on the basis of previous Quality of Experience (QoE) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) records.

However, with this broader connectivity, new vulnerabilities and attack vectors are being introduced, increasing opportunities for systems to be compromised by hackers and targeted attacks. These vulnerabilities pose severe threats to a myriad of IoT applications within areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, power and energy grids, transportation and commercial building management. While embedded OEMs offer technologies, such as hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM), that deploy strong chain-of-trust and authentication mechanisms, still they struggle to protect against vulnerabilities introduced by vendors and end users, as well as additional threats posed by potential technical vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks. This paper proposes a pro-active policy-based approach, enforcing the principle of least privilege, through hardware Security Policy Engine (SPE) that actively monitors communication of applications and system resources on the system communication bus (ARM AMBA-AXI4). Upon detecting a policy violation, for example, a malicious application accessing protected storage, it counteracts with predefined mitigations to limit the attack. The proposed SPE approach widely complements existing embedded hardware and software security technologies, targeting the mitigation of risks imposed by unknown vulnerabilities of embedded applications and protocols.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;embedded systems;Internet of Things;platform module;secure IoT technologies;malicious application;hardware security policy engine;embedded applications;software security technologies;embedded hardware;SPE approach;policy violation;system communication bus;system resources;pro-active policy;zero-day attacks;potential technical vulnerabilities;additional threats;end users;authentication mechanisms;chain-of-trust;commercial building management;IoT applications;attack vectors;business operations;supply chain efficiencies;quality control;FPGA;MPSoC;Root-of-trust;ARM TrustZone},   doi={10.1049/cp.2018.0010},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;ultralow-power design;battery-operated wearable devices;energy supply;hardware resources;biosignal compressor;compression technique;Huffman table;wireless communication;wearable device energy consumption;Electrocardiography;Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Monitoring;Encoding;Histograms;Biomedical Healthcare;Wearable Devices;Approximate Computing;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT},   doi={10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework. Since the response time of the proposed system is less, it is suitable for real time alerting.},   keywords={Big Data;biosensors;cloud computing;data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;wearable computers;Big data analytics;IoT;health care monitoring system;Internet of Things;wearable biosensors;Internet of health sensor things;physicians concern;patients health information;Intel Galileo Gen 2;cloud computing;Hadoop;Big data;Bio sensors;Cloud;health care monitoring systems;Hadoop;IoT},   doi={10.1109/UPCON.2016.7894624},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={35988-36001},   abstract={Obtrusive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most important sleep disorders because it has a direct adverse impact on the quality of life. Intellectual deterioration, decreased psychomotor performance, behavior, and personality disorders are some of the consequences of OSA. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of this disorder is a critical need in healthcare solutions. There are several systems for OSA detection. Nevertheless, despite their promising results, these systems not guiding their treatment. For these reasons, this research presents an innovative system for both to detect and support of treatment of OSA of elderly people by monitoring multiple factors such as sleep environment, sleep status, physical activities, and physiological parameters as well as the use of open data available in smart cities. Our system architecture performs two types of processing. On the one hand, a pre-processing based on rules that enables the sending of real-time notifications to responsible for the care of elderly, in the event of an emergency situation. This pre-processing is essentially based on a fog computing approach implemented in a smart device operating at the edge of the network that additionally offers advanced interoperability services: technical, syntactic, and semantic. On the other hand, a batch data processing that enables a descriptive analysis that statistically details the behavior of the data and a predictive analysis for the development of services, such as predicting the least polluted place to perform outdoor activities. This processing uses big data tools on cloud computing. The performed experiments show a 93.3% of effectivity in the air quality index prediction to guide the OSA treatment. The system's performance has been evaluated in terms of latency. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the pre-processing of data at the edge of the network improves the efficiency of the system.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;open systems;patient monitoring;sleep;real-time monitoring;healthcare solutions;OSA detection;innovative system;elderly people;sleep environment;physical activities;physiological parameters;open data;smart cities;real-time notifications;fog computing approach;smart device operating;batch data processing;predictive analysis;outdoor activities;performed experiments;air quality index prediction;OSA treatment;smart system;sleep monitoring;integrating IoT;obtrusive sleep apnea;important sleep disorders;direct adverse impact;intellectual deterioration;personality disorders;Big Data tools;psychomotor performance;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Computer architecture;Big Data;Sensors;Internet-of-Things;big data;interoperability;sleep monitoring;health monitoring;open data;fog computing;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849822},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Map reduce for optimizing a large-scale dynamic network — the Internet of hearts}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2962-2965},   abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},   keywords={cardiology;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes;map reduce;large-scale dynamic network;Internet-of-hearts;sensing technology;mobile technology;smart connected healthcare;data analytics;mobile health system;disease pattern recognition;stochastic gradient descent approach;global network;network optimization;multiple processors;parallel computing;Parallel processing;Sensors;Program processors;Monitoring;Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Algorithms;Heart;Humans;Internet;Stochastic Processes;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351},   ISSN={1558-4615},   month={Aug},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={475-480},   abstract={The US healthcare Affordable Care Act established the 30 day readmission protection program as one of the base lines of measuring quality of care at hospitals and post discharge. With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction.

With the increasing number of visually impaired people, including the blind, the elderly, and patients with eye diseases, it is vital to help them explore their outside environment with the assistance of smart technologies so that they can adapt to the environment more easily. The smart indoor anti-collision system is one typical application. Previous works normally use video monitors or deployed sensors to provide outside environment information for visually impaired people. However, these methods suffer from privacy disclosure and inconvenience. In this article, we present IAAS, a smart indoor anti-collision system based on RFID, which identifies and tracks passive RFID tags by analyzing the received backscatter signals. We extract RSSI based on the LWLR algorithm and phase profiles as fingerprints to help the user guide from obstacles without observations of eyes. Experiments are conducted to verify our system, and results show that IAAS could achieve high accuracy of 94 percent in obstacle avoidance.},   keywords={alarm systems;cloud computing;collision avoidance;data privacy;diseases;handicapped aids;health care;patient care;radiofrequency identification;sensors;high-quality patient care;visually impaired people;smart technologies;smart indoor anti-collision system;indoor anti-collision alarm system;smart healthcare;RFID;LWLR algorithm;IAAS;privacy disclosure;Antennas;Backscatter;Antenna measurements;Medical services;RFID tags;Wearable computers;Alarm systems;Patient monitoring},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700706},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={APRIL},}

However, the mobility of mobile users and the limited coverage of edge servers can result in significant network performance degradation, dramatic drop in QoS, and even interruption of ongoing edge services; therefore, it is difficult to ensure service continuity. Service migration has great potential to address the issues, which decides when or where these services are migrated following user mobility and the changes of demand. In this paper, two conceptions similar to service migration, i.e., live migration for data centers and handover in cellular networks, are first discussed. Next, the cutting-edge research efforts on service migration in MEC are reviewed, and a devisal of taxonomy based on various research directions for efficient service migration is presented.

Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS.

Meanwhile, there is an accelerated tendency towards mobility of IoT devices, either being transported by humans or being mobile by itself. Existing energy management mechanisms for battery-powered IoT fail to consider the two significant characteristics of IoT: the approximate real-time computation, and the mobility of IoT devices, resulting in unnecessary energy waste and network lifetime decay. In this paper, we explore mobility-aware network lifetime maximization for battery-powered IoT applications that perform approximate real-time computation under the Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraint. The proposed scheme is composed of offline and online stages. At offline stage, an optimal mobility-aware task schedule that maximizes network lifetime is derived by using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) technique. Redundant executions due to mobility-incurred overlapping of a single task on different IoT devices are avoided for energy savings. At online stage, a performance-guaranteed and time-efficient QoS-adaptive heuristic based on cross-entropy method is developed to adapt task execution to the fluctuating QoS requirements. Extensive simulations based on synthetic applications and real-life benchmarks have been implemented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve up to 169.52% network lifetime improvement compared to benchmarking solutions.},   keywords={Task analysis;Quality of service;Energy management;Real-time systems;Optimization;Performance evaluation;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);network lifetime optimization;approximate real-time computation;Quality-of-Service (QoS);mobility.},   doi={10.1109/TCAD.2018.2873239},   ISSN={0278-0070},   month={},}

Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1236-1241},   abstract={Internet of Things(loT) has found various applications in healthcare systems with the capabilities of connecting embedded devices in various systems to the internet providing immediate readings, remote monitoring and enabling enhanced decision making. Researchers have found critical vulnerabilities such as compromise of private health data, hackers monitoring private conversations via a baby monitor, compromise of a moving internet enabled car or shutting it down altogether while in motion. Attention to security is not increasing at the same rapid pace as the number of IoT devices. Hence, security is beginning to be a major concern with the advent of IoT, connecting numerous devices introducing new attack vectors. This paper is intended to focus on the benefits of integrating security in IoT. The paper begins with design and implementation of a basic Health Monitor for remote monitoring and tracking of pulse rate and body temperature of patients treated in hospitals. While developing the Health Monitor, security is integrated in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). This integration intends to demonstrate identification and mitigation of the critical known security vulnerabilities thereby producing a much secure end product. Additional security assurance is provided by testing the IoT Health Monitor for applicable five of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 IoT vulnerabilities: (1) Insecure Web Interface, (2) Insufficient Authentication/Authorization, (3) Lack of Transport Encryption, (4) Privacy Concerns, and (5) Insufficient Security Configurability. OWASP is a prominent neutral global charitable association with a sole objective to develop software security standards and necessary tools.},   keywords={Security;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Conferences;Medical services;Internet of Things(IoT) Security;Security;IoT;Secure Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) for IoT;Secure Health Monitor},   doi={10.1109/ICECA.2018.8474668},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

 title={Energy efficient IoT thermometer based on fuzzy logic for fever monitoring}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;fuzzy logic;health care;Internet of Things;pacemakers;patient monitoring;telemetry;thermometers;Remote Digital Blood Pressure;energy issues;energy consumption;data transmission;monitoring fever body temperature;HI-Thermo;adaptive system;fuzzy logic;Hi-Thermo;fever body temperature monitoring;existing traditional monitoring;energy efficient IoT;fever monitoring;Information Communication Technology;health services;digital systems;WIFI digital thermometer;Telemetry Digital Pacemaker;HI;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Testing;Healthcare;Monitoring;Digital;Logic fuzzy;Thermometer;IoT},   doi={10.1109/ICoICT.2017.8074640},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={45-52},   abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},   keywords={backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;artificial neural network-based approach;chronic disease prediction model;population aging;Internet of Things;IoT technology;healthcare technology;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;cardiovascular diseases;quality of life improvement;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;ANN;binary logistic regression model;behavior risk factor surveillance system;BRFSS;multilayer perception neural network model;MLP neural network model;back propagation;BP algorithm;area under the receiver-operator curve;AUC;Hypertension;Diseases;Predictive models;Logistics;Artificial neural networks;Analytical models;Regression analysis;logistic regression;artifical neural network;hypertension prediction},   doi={10.1109/iThings.2014.16},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

This combination generates a new paradigm for pervasive and ubiquitous computing.

Considerable efforts have been proposed to improve the efficiency of CoT architectures.

Subsequently, the paper explains some related issues of CoT, including the lack of standardization.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={This paper proposes a novel physical-layer-aided security technique for protecting a social Internet of things (SIoT) architecture-based healthcare system. Exploiting the social relationship link between healthcare user (e.g., patients and elderly people) and healthcare provider (e.g., physicians), social networks can play the role of a trusted online platform to establish service application interfaces between healthcare user (HU) and healthcare provider (HP). This enables the Internet of things (IoT) medical devices (e.g., IoT body sensor) to timely share the bio-data of HU with remote HP via the both storage-rich and computational resource-rich social networks. Given the high security requirement on SIoT data sharing and the fact that resource-constrained IoT devices cannot efficiently execute complicated cryptography, a robust and cost-effective two-phase security method is proposed by exploiting the device-specific physical-layer (PHY) attributes. Specifically, the PHY carrier frequency offset and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance of an IoT device are practically estimated to generate the PHY-ID. Using our PHY-ID, the SIoT HU authentication and the bio-data confidentiality are simultaneously enhanced without posing any additional implementation overhead at IoT body sensors, which is especially applicable for the resource-constrained IoT devices.},   keywords={body sensor networks;computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;social networking (online);bio-data confidentiality;IoT body sensor;PHY-aided secure IoT healthcare system;social relationship link;healthcare user;healthcare provider;trusted online platform;service application interfaces;remote HP;computational resource-rich social networks;SIoT data sharing;novel physical-layer-aided security technique;social Internet of things architecture-based healthcare system;Internet of things medical devices;storage-rich social networks;device-specific physical layer attributes;PHY carrier frequency offset;SIoT HU authentication;PHY-ID;in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance;two-phase security method;resource-constrained IoT devices;Medical services;Estimation;Social network services;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288341},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Mobile healthcare crowd sensing (MHCS), as a typical application of IoT, is becoming an effective approach to provide various medical and healthcare services to individual or organizations. However, MHCS still have to face to different security challenges in practice. For example, how to quickly and effectively authenticate masses of bio-information uploaded by IoT terminals without revealing the owners&amp;#x2019; sensitive information. Therefore, we propose a large-scale concurrent data anonymous batch verification scheme for MHCS based on an improved certificateless aggregate signature. The proposed scheme can authenticate all sensing bio-information at once in a privacy preserving way. The individual data generated by different users can be verified in batch, while the actual identity of participants is hidden. Moreover, assuming the intractability of CDHP, our scheme is proved to be secure. Finally, the performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is suitable for MHCS, due to its high efficiency.},   keywords={Medical services;Sensors;Security;Aggregates;Privacy;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Mobile Healthcare Crowd Sensing;Aggregate Signature;Batch Verification;Privacy Preservation.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828463},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Due to the many beneficial effects on physical and mental health and strong association with many fitness and rehabilitation programs, physical activity (PA) recognition has been considered as a key paradigm for internet of things (IoT) healthcare. Traditional PA recognition techniques focus on repeated aerobic exercises or stationary PA. As a crucial indicator in human health, it covers a range of bodily movement from aerobics to anaerobic that may all bring health benefits. However, existing PA recognition approaches are mostly designed for specific scenarios and often lack extensibility for application in other areas, thereby limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we attempt to detect more gym physical activities (GPAs) in addition to traditional PA using acceleration, A two layer recognition framework is proposed that can classify aerobic, sedentary and free weight activities, count repetitions and sets for the free weight exercises, and in the meantime, measure quantities of repetitions and sets for free weight activities. In the first layer, a one-class SVM (OC-SVM) is applied to coarsely classify free weight and non-free weight activities. In the second layer, a neural network (NN) is utilized for aerobic and sedentary activities recognition; a hidden Markov model (HMM) is to provide a further classification in free weight activities. The performance of the framework was tested on 10 healthy subjects (age: 30 &amp;#x00B1; 5; BMI: 25 &amp;#x00B1; 5.5 kg/m2; body fat: 20.5 &amp;#x00B1; 5.4), and compared with some typical classifiers.

In the view of ever increasing sources of toxic chemicals, these systems should have the facilities to detect and calibrate the source quickly. Toxic gases are the ones that cause health impact but humans are being exposed to it in various situations. These gases have to be monitored such that increase in the normal level of them could be known and proper precaution measures can be undertaken. So, an embedded system is designed using a microcontroller with internet of things, for the purpose of detecting and monitoring the hazardous gas leakage, which aids in the evasion of endangering of human lives. The hazardous gases can be sensed and displayed each and every second, in proximity to one more sensor for tracking heart beats which help to monitor the condition of the sewer labourers. If both the gases along with a pulse detector exceeds the normal level then an alarm is generated immediately and also an alert warning message can be sent to the authorised administrator and as well to the nearest health center to make the sewer labourers feel comfortable with necessary first aid and possibilities with the treatment in the case of emergency. Once the message is received by the health center, they enforce their team with necessary first aid to the current location to save the sewer labourer. Once this system is established for a particular user this will completely become fully automated and does not need any other additional people for monitoring and alerting purpose. It has an advantage over the manual method in offering quick response time and accurate detection of an emergency.},   keywords={gas sensors;wireless sensor networks;biomedical measurement;personnel;health hazards;industrial accidents;wireless sensing system;sewer labourer welfare;environmental pollution monitoring;toxic chemicals;toxic gases;microcontroller;internet of things;hazardous gases;heart beats;pulse detector;alert warning message;health center;first aid;fully automated;quick response time},   doi={10.1049/htl.2017.0017},   ISSN={2053-3713},   month={},}

In parallel, a growing number of consumer electronic (CE) devices like TVs, refrigerators or media players are becoming capable of taking the role of “health hub”, that is, a data collector for the sensor PHDs. Many PHDs (and the respective collectors) follow a standard protocol stack for health devices: IEEE 11073-20601. This paper presents Antidote: a portable, open-source implementation of the IEEE 11073-20601 stack, which further promotes this standard and increases its availability to the developer community. One of the main contributions of Antidote is how it exports health data using a DataList XML or JSON format, which helps its integration by developers in different platforms. Finally, it is presented our experience using Antidote on different scenarios, such as on mobile platforms and IoT networks.},   keywords={health care;IEEE standards;Internet of Things;ISO standards;patient monitoring;protocols;XML;personal health devices;IoT health vision;consumer electronic devices;data collector;standard protocol stack;Antidote;open-source implementation;IEEE 11073-20601 stack;IoT health systems;high-quality life;chronic conditions;IEEE 11073-20601;Standards;Conferences;Androids;Humanoid robots;Medical services;Bluetooth;Linux;m-Health;Personal Health Devices;IEEE 11073;Mobile Devices;Framework},   doi={10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8369020},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={366-379},   abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) can allow healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients by analyzing the sensors outputs with big data analytics. Sleeping conditions are one of the most influential factors on health. However, the literature lacks of the appropriate simulation tools to widely support the research on the recognition of sleeping postures. This paper proposes an agent-based simulation framework to simulate sleeper movements on a simulated smart bed with load sensors. This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors. This simulator can also generate logs text files with big data for applying offline big data techniques on them. The source code of ABS-BedIoT and some examples of logs are freely available from a public research repository. The current approach is illustrated with an algorithm that properly recognized the simulated sleeping postures with an average accuracy of 98%. This accuracy is higher than the one reported by an existing alternative work in this area.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;power system simulation;sleep;smart power grids;internet-of-things;healthcare professionals;load sensors;sleeping posture recognition algorithms;ABS-BedIoT simulator;bed sensors;offline big data techniques;smart beds;Big data analytics;remotely monitor patients;agent-based simulation framework;Intelligent sensors;Big Data;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Agent-based-simulation;big data;Internet-of-Things;multi-agent systems;smart bed},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={BLE Beacon-based Activity Monitoring System toward Automatic Generation of Daily Report}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={788-793},   abstract={As the world's population of senior citizens continues to grow, the burdens on the professionals who care for them (carers) are also increasing. In nursing homes, carers need to make a daily report for each resident aiming to improve his/her quality of life. However, in the present understaffed situation, it is difficult and burdensome for carers to record the resident's activity in detail since each carer needs to take care of several residents at the same time. In this paper, we propose an automatic daily report generation system which can monitor the activity of multiple residents in nursing homes. Knowing that important activities such as toilet, bathing, rehabilitation and so on take place in specific areas in a nursing home, it is possible to record residents' activities by tracking their stay areas and movement between the areas within the day. Our proposed system estimates stay areas of multiple residents by machine learning for RSSI values that are sent from BLE beacons attached to residents and received at BLE scanners deployed over multiple areas, and records activities of the residents determined based on their estimated stay areas. The proposed system can also output a daily report of each resident based on the recorded data. We carried out a five-day experiment with four elderly participants in a nursing home and evaluated activity estimation accuracy by leave-one-person-out cross-validation. As a result, our proposed system achieved the weighted average F-measure of 81.6%.},   keywords={Medical services;Activity recognition;Servers;Estimation;Smoothing methods;Monitoring;Senior citizens;Healthcare Industrial Internet of Things (HealthI–IoT);Random Forest;Bluetooth Low Energy},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480348},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Networked body sensing devices coupled with sensors in our living environment enable the real-time and continuous collection of information related to an individual's physical and mental health and related behaviors. Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={With the pervasiveness of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid progress of wireless communications, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have attracted significant interest from the research community in recent years. As a promising networking paradigm, it is adopted to improve the healthcare services and create a highly reliable ubiquitous healthcare system. However, the flourish of WBANs still faces many challenges related to security and privacy preserving. In such pervasive environment where the context conditions dynamically and frequently change, context-aware solutions are needed to satisfy the users' changing needs. Therefore, it is essential to design an adaptive access control scheme that can simultaneously authorize and authenticate users while considering the dynamic context changes. In this paper, we propose a context-aware access control and anonymous authentication approach based on a secure and efficient Hybrid Certificateless Signcryption (H-CLSC) scheme. The proposed scheme combines the merits of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Signcryption (CP-ABSC) and Identity-Based Broadcast Signcryption (IBBSC) in order to satisfy the security requirements and provide an adaptive contextual privacy. From a security perspective, it achieves confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, context-aware privacy, public verifiability, and ciphertext authenticity. Moreover, the key escrow and public key certificate problems are solved through this mechanism. Performance analysis demonstrates the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to benchmark schemes in terms of functional security, storage, communication and computational cost.},   keywords={authorisation;body area networks;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;message authentication;mobile radio;telecommunication control;ubiquitous computing;context-aware authorization;wireless body area networks;wireless communications;healthcare services;adaptive access control scheme;context-aware access control;anonymous authentication approach;adaptive contextual privacy;context-aware privacy;ciphertext authenticity;WBAN;ubiquitous healthcare system;Internet of Things;hybrid certificateless signcryption;identity-based broadcast signcryption;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Authentication;Access control;Privacy;Public key},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422397},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},   keywords={cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;signal detection;smart cities;speech processing;running speech;sustained vowel;energy distribution;linear prediction analysis;source signal;automatic voice disorder detection system;healthcare resources;elderly people;smart healthcare systems;smart technologies;cloud computing;Internet of Things;smart cities;voice complications;automatic health monitoring system;frequency 1 Hz to 1562 Hz;Speech;Smart cities;Monitoring;Medical services;Senior citizens;Feature extraction;Acoustics;Smart cities;health monitoring;voice disorders;liner prediction;GMM},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2680467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},   keywords={compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;long-term health monitoring;signal characteristics;personalized features;physiologic signals;cotraining approach;sensing matrix;isometry property;signal sparsity;ECG signals;compression ratio;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;Sensors;Dictionaries;Sparse matrices;Physiology;Training;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless communication;Data-driven compressive sensing;mobile healthcare;wearable sensing;Internet of things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278},   ISSN={2379-190X},   month={March},}

One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain.

  year={2017},   volume={21},   number={1},   pages={56-64},   abstract={The increasing popularity of wearable devices in recent years means that a diverse range of physiological and functional data can now be captured continuously for applications in sports, wellbeing, and healthcare. This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.},   keywords={data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);wearable computers;on-node sensor data analytics;deep learning approach;wearable devices;inertial sensor;spectral domain preprocessing;smartphones;Internet-of-Things;Human Activity Recognition;HAR;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis;Spectrogram;Real-time systems;Pipelines;Performance evaluation;ActiveMiles;deep learning;Human Activity Recognition (HAR);Internet-of-Things (IoT);low-power devices;wearable;Human Activities;Humans;Machine Learning;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Neural Networks (Computer);Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2016.2633287},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Jan},}

Healthcare of things (HoT) would enhance healthcare using the insight provided by sensor data. Healthcare users will subscribe to HoT services that use sensors to get activity data (such as steps walked, hours slept and so on) along with other health vitals (such as heart rate, temperature and weight) to improve user's health. Similarly Smart home users subscribe to a Smart home cloud service that will use data from home sensors. Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users. Also, IoT users need to be able easily choose between multiple options for service providers. In this demonstration, we highlight how user experience perspectives impact the data framework design in MPMC environments, using our drops data framework infrastructure.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={9-14},   abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},   keywords={adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising;ECG classification;wearable health monitoring devices;personalized health-care monitoring devices;signal processing;Savitzky-Golay filter;machine learning models;MIT-BIH Physionet;ECG kits biopotential measurements;kNN classifiers;neural net fitting models;SNOMED coding system;feature extraction method;ECG event observations;MITDB arrhythmia database;recursive least square adaptive filter;3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG waveforms;arrhythmia classification;heart rate variability analysis;electronic health records database;ECG monitoring;wearable biomedical devices;FHIR interoperability;healthcare interoperability;personalized wearable systems;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Adaptive filters;Real-time systems;Arrhythmia classification;Wearable IoT;Healthcare monitoring;ECG signal processing;Arrhythmia detection;Arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;ECG FHIR;SNOMED-CT FHIR;HAPI FHIR},   doi={10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1471-1479},   abstract={Advances in multimedia technologies have led to the emergence of smart home applications. In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants' activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcaremonitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={648-653},   abstract={Sensors are important components in the Internet of Things (IoT) that encompass a wide spectrum of applications from healthcare to monitoring critical infrastructure. Securely gathering sensor measurements by adopting traditional cryptographic mechanisms is fraught with vulnerabilities emanating from the inability to safeguard secrets on edge devices, often in adversarial environments, where appropriate hardware protection logic and power consumption overheads are counterproductive to the desire to keep the devices low cost and long lasting. This paper continues recent efforts into investigating an alternative secure sensing approach with the potential to provide a solution for resource-restricted IoT devices. In particular, we investigate the possibility to exploit unreliability of a physical unclonable function (PUF) resulting from its sensitivity to variations in supply voltage conditions to guarantee the veracity of physical measurements from potentially any transducer capable of converting a physical phenomenon to a voltage signal. Therefore we present an approach that has the potential to realize a universal PUF sensor where the PUF itself acts as a sensor or is integrated with a sensor. Thus, for a PUF sensor, cryptographic processes and sensing are inseparable. Further, we rely on a dominant external condition-voltage-responsible for unreliability to secure sensing. We validate the feasibility of the proposed universal PUF sensor approach based on experimental data extracted from RO-PUFs (Ring Oscillator PUFs).},   keywords={computerised instrumentation;cryptography;Internet;Internet of Things;oscillators;reliability;security;sensors;transducers;PUF sensor;physical measurement security;Internet of Things;healthcare;critical infrastructure monitoring;cryptographic mechanism;hardware protection logic;power consumption;alternative secure sensing approach;resource-restricted IoT device;physical unclonable function;transducer;ring oscillator;RO;Sensors;Cryptography;Frequency division multiplexing;Internet of Things;Hardware;Transducers;PUF sensor;secure sensing;hardware security;physical unclonable function},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917639},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={xx-xxi},   abstract={In recent years, the growing demand of personal healthcare has attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure. Using the model, diseases are ranked according to the current symptoms and stored in the server. Information of diseases and appropriate treatment therapies is sent back to the patient as well as stored in a web portal for personal monitoring.},   keywords={bioinformatics;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;patient treatment;pattern clustering;temperature measurement;temperature sensors;health informatics;intelligent system;personal healthcare monitoring;Internet-of-Thing technology;IoT technology;knowledge model;physical conditions;IoT device;LM35 sensors;temperature measurement;pulse sensor;heart beat;ESP8266 sensors;network connection;disease diagnosis;viral fever;hypothermia;tachycardia;heart failure;intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system;intuitionistic fuzzy set;multicriteria IFRS;single-criterion IFRS;intuitionistic fuzzy vector;intuitionistic vector similarity measure;IVSM},   doi={10.1109/NICS.2016.7725627},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Under the background, human activity recognition (HAR) has drawn great attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a discriminant approach to recognize daily human activities recorded through accelerometer sensor. In the proposed approach, we first use S transform (ST) to extract features, and then introduce a supervised regularization-based robust subspace (SRRS) learning method to learn low-dimensional intrinsic feature representation from the original feature subspace. Particularly, ST has been described as a joint time-frequency representation (TFR), which is insensitive to noise. SRRS can learn more robust and discriminative features to reinforce the descriptions of samples while removing noise and redundancy. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets i.e., WISDM, SCUT-NAA and mHealth demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared with state-of-the-art methods.},   keywords={Feature extraction;Accelerometers;Internet of Things;Activity recognition;Medical services;Data mining;Transforms;Internet of Things;wearable computing;human activity recognition;S transform;dimensionality reduction.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2873594},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

GS1 EPCglobal has led the development of RFID standards from unique identifier, communication protocol to event repository. Recently, its scope starts to broaden with the new standard of EPC Information Service (EPCIS v1.1), while GS1 EPCglobal had focused on RFID middleware in the field of supply chain management (SCM). We believe that EPCIS can act as an event-based context repository for IoT. However, the challenges of scalability and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from a variety of sources. In this paper, we propose the novel open source platform complying with the EPCIS v1.1 specification called Oliot EPCIS, which can collect and share event data for a broad range of IoT applications. The main contribution of the paper is as follows. To resolve the challenges, we propose the scalable and flexible EPCIS architecture, the document-based model of EPCIS event and the new event called SensorEvent. We show that Oliot EPCIS generally outperforms two existing solutions through the comparative experiment.

 title={IoT-Fog based Healthcare Framework to Identify and Control Hypertension Attack}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Hypertension is a chronic disease causing risk of different types of disorders such as hypertension attacks, cerebrovascular attacks, kidney failure and cardiovascular diseases. To prevent such risks, statistics related to hypertension have to be monitored and analyzed in real time. Internet of Things (IoT) assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to monitor blood pressure and to diagnose the stage of hypertension in real time. In this paper, IoT-Fog based healthcare system is proposed for continuous monitoring and analysis of blood pressure statistics to predict hypertensive users. The proposed system initially identifies the stage of hypertension on the basis of user’s health parameters collected using IoT sensors at fog layer. After identifying the hypertensive stage, artificial neural network is used for predicting the risk level of hypertension attack in users at remote sites. The vital point of this paper is to continuously generate emergency alerts of blood pressure fluctuation from fog system to hypertensive users on their mobile phones. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user are stored on cloud storage for sharing with domain experts such as clinicians, doctors and personal caregivers. The temporal information generated from fog layer can be utilized for providing precautionary measures and suggestions well on time for patients’ wellness. Experimental results reveal that proposed framework achieves low response time, high accuracy and bandwidth efficiency.},   keywords={Hypertension;Sensors;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Hypertension;Fog-cloud Computing;Artifical Neural Network;Internet of Things (IoT).},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2871630},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={1086-1108},   abstract={Our world and our lives are changing in many ways. Communication, networking, and computing technologies are among the most influential enablers that shape our lives today. Digital data and connected worlds of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.},   keywords={data analysis;data integration;Internet of Things;smart cities;social networking (online);decision support;contextual filtering;quality assessment;event detection;intelligent data aggregation;data processing techniques;cross-domain data integration;social media data streams;large-scale real-time Internet of Things data interpretation;semantic discovery;smart city service creation;CityPulse framework;digital data;large scale data analytic framework;Smart cities;Data analytics;Distributed databases;Semantics;Control systems;Environmental monitoring;Telecommunication services;Medical services;Digital systems;Knowledge discovery;Data analytics framework;smart cities;Data analytics framework;smart cities},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2541999},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={A Fog-Based Healthcare Framework for Chikungunya}, 
  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={2},   pages={794-801},   abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multiorgan failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user's infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user's mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using temporal network analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision trees;diseases;graph theory;health care;mobile computing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;healthcare framework;Aedes agypti;healthcare services;fog-cloud technology;fog assisted healthcare system;decision tree;real-time healthcare data;Chikungunya virus infection;Chikungunya virus outbreak;fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system;Cloud computing;Sensors;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Pain;Decision trees;Chikungunya;cloud computing (CC);decision tree;fog computing (FOC);temporal network analysis (TNA)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Over the past 50 years, public health in Latin America has walked through significant changes on social and economic aspects. Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Latin America;geographical coverage;physical health stands;Latin American healthcare systems;Latin American governments;wearable technology adoption;healthcare wearable technology challenges;Internet of Medical Things;IoMT;healthcare wearable technology;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Government;Security;Public healthcare;Real-time systems;healthcare;wearable;IoMT;Latin-America;adoption;barriers;challenges},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399181},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Indicatively, telemedicine, real-time diagnosis and remote monitoring of patients, are expected to transform the healthcare domain. These systems may offer several services of different criticality, necessitating safety-/mission-critical core components and non-critical peripheral components; in other words, they are complex, mixed-criticality System-of-Systems (SoS). To understand and design such systems, engineers must be facilitated with the appropriate modeling tools. In this work, we explore the application of model-based design, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), of IoT e-Health systems, emphasizing criticality requirements. We focus on the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS) use case, combining IoT technologies with classic healthcare practices, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. Requirements comprise a basic concept of a systematic model-driven methodology that enables the successful management of the criticalities in system design, implementation and deployment. In the REMS use case, identified criticalities are modeled as SysML requirements, while SysML constraints and parametric diagrams are employed to describe and verify quantitative criticality requirements.},   keywords={cloud computing;formal specification;formal verification;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;SysML;systems analysis;mixed-criticality System-of-Systems;model-based design;Systems Modeling Language;Remote Elderly Monitoring System;IoT technologies;system design;SysML requirements;model-based approach;e-Health IoT Systems;Internet-based solutions;healthcare domain;modeling tools;model-driven methodology;healthcare practices;Internet of Things;cloud computing;criticality requirements management;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Senior citizens;Cloud computing;Unified modeling language;Databases;Internet of Things;Healthcare;Model-Driven Engineering;SysML;Remote Elderly Monitoring;Criticalities;Requirements},   doi={10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428764},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Because the medical records in IoT-based hospital information system (HIS) are dispersedly obtained from distributed devices such as tablet computer, personal digital assistant, automated analyzer, and other medical devices, they are raw, simple, weak-content, and massive. Such medical records cannot be used for further analyzing and decision supporting due to that they are collected in a weak-semantic manner.

IoTs are power and bandwidth-constrained with applications in smarthome, healthcare, transportation and industrial domains. Routing bears significant importance in IoTs where sensors acting as hosts deliver data to the gateways which in turn impacts power consumption. Thus there exists a need for modeling and analysis of routing in IoT networks towards predicting power consumption. In this work, we develop an analytical model of a naive flooding based routing protocol using Markov chains. In particular, we derive steady state transition probabilities of transmit and receive states using protocol execution traces and further utilize them towards predicting power consumption. Our approach to modeling is generic in that it can be applied to routing protocols across domains. Evaluation of the model shows that the predicted values for power consumption lie closer to the actual observations obtained using ns-2 simulation thus resulting in minimal mean square errors.},   keywords={Internet of Things;Markov processes;mean square error methods;routing protocols;IoT networks;Internet of Things;real-time communication;decision making capabilty;smarthome;healthcare;transportation;industrial domain;power consumption;routing analysis;routing modeling;flooding-based routing protocol;Markov chains;steady state transition probability;receive state;transmit state;protocol execution trace;ns-2 simulation;minimal mean square errors;Routing protocols;Routing;Computational modeling;Power demand;Markov processes;Analytical models},   doi={10.1109/CoCoNet.2015.7411258},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2399-2406},   abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services toward 5G.},   keywords={Big Data;data analysis;emotion recognition;Internet of Things;medical image processing;patient care;data analytics;big data-oriented wireless technologies;emotional care;emotion-aware connected healthcare system;image signals;seamless emotion-aware healthcare services;edge computing;interconnected devices;IoT devices;speech signals;healthcare big data;emotion detection module;Medical services;Emotion recognition;Big Data;5G mobile communication;Speech;Feature extraction;Wireless sensor networks;5G;big data;emotion recognition;emotion-aware healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);local binary pattern (LBP)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2772959},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

 title={An Artificial Neural Network Framework for Gait Based Biometrics}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={As the popularity of wearable and implantable Body Sensor Network (BSN) devices increases, there is a growing concern regarding the data security of such power-constrained miniaturized medical devices. With limited computational power, BSN devices are often not able to provide strong security mechanisms to protect sensitive personal and health information, such as one's physiological data. Consequently, many new methods of securing Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been proposed recently. One effective solution is the Biometric Cryptosystem (BCS) approach. BCS exploits physiological and behavioral biometric traits, including face, iris, fingerprints, Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Photoplethysmography (PPG). In this paper, we propose a new BCS approach for securing wireless communications for wearable and implantable healthcare devices using gait signal energy variations and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework. By simultaneously extracting similar features from BSN sensors using our approach, binary keys can be generated on demand without user intervention. Through an extensive analysis on our BCS approach using a gait dataset, the results have shown that the binary keys generated using our approach have high entropy for all subjects. The keys can pass both NIST and Dieharder statistical tests with high efficiency. The experimental results also show the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of the similarity of intra-class keys and the discriminability of the inter-class keys.},   keywords={Sensors;Security;Wireless communication;Biometrics (access control);Wireless sensor networks;Servers;Communication system security;wearable security;gait biometrics;artificial neural network;data privacy;wireless communications;IoT security},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2018.2860780},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={6},   pages={515-526},   abstract={Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;health care;Internet of Things;medical control systems;medical information systems;patient monitoring;personal area networks;radiofrequency identification;telemedicine;Web services;wireless sensor networks;IoT-aware architecture;smart healthcare systems;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;wireless sensor network;smart mobile technologies;automatic patient monitoring;automatic patient tracking;biomedical devices;smart hospital system;constrained application protocol;low-power wireless personal area network infrastructure;representational state transfer network infrastructure;patient physiological parameters;ultralow-power hybrid sensing network;UHF RFID functionalities;control center;local users;remote users;REST web service;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Hospitals;Computer architecture;RFID;WSN;healthcare;Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP);healthcare;hybrid networks;radio frequency identification (RFID);representational state transfer (REST);6LoWPAN;smart environment;wireless sensor network (WSN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2417684},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={666-671},   abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is emerging as one of the popular technologies influencing every aspect of human life. The IoT devices equipped with sensors are changing every domain of the world to become smarter. In particular, the majorly benifited service sectors are agriculture, industries, healthcare, control &amp;amp; automation, retail &amp;amp; logistics, and power &amp;amp; energy. The data generated in these areas is massive requiring bigger storage and stronger compute. On the other hand, the IoT devices are limited in processing and storage capabilities and can not store and process the sensed data locally. Hence, there is a dire need to integrate these devices with the external data sources for effective utilisation and assessment of the collected data. Several existing well-known message exchange protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are applicable in IoT communications. However, a thorough study is required to understand their impact and suitability in IoT scenario for the exchange of information between external data sources and IoT devices. In this paper, we designed and implemented an application layer framework to test and understand the behavior of these protocols and conducted the experiments on a realistic test bed using wired, wifi and 2/3/4G networks. The results revealed that MQTT and AMQP perform well on wired and wireless connections whereas CoAP performs consistently well and is less network dependent. On the lossy networks, CoAP generates low traffic as compared to MQTT and AMQP. The low memory footprint of MQTT and CoAP has made them a better choice over AMQP.},   keywords={Internet of Things;protocols;IoT devices;MQTT;AMQP;CoAP;external data sources;Message Queuing Telemetry Transport;Advanced Message Queuing Protocol;Constrained Application Protocol;IoT communications;data collection;message exchange protocols;Internet-of-Things messaging protocols;sensors;application layer framework;2/3/4G networks;Wi-Fi network;wired network;Protocols;Servers;Telemetry;Bandwidth;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Performance evaluation;IoT;Internet of Things;MQTT;AMQP;COAP;MQTT-SN;IoT Protocols;Application Layer Protocols;IoT applications},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.85},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

 title={Device Grouping for Fast and Efficient Channel Access in IEEE 802.11ah Based IoT Networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have led to numerous emerging applications ranging from eHealthcare to industrial control, which often demand stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as low-latency and high system reliability. However, the ever-increasing number of connected devices in ultra-dense IoT networks and the dynamic traffic patterns increase the channel access delay and packet collision rate. In this regard, this paper proposes a sector-based device grouping scheme for fast and efficient channel access in IEEE 802.11ah based IoT networks such that the total number of the connected devices within each sector is dramatically reduced. In the proposed framework, the Access Point (AP) divides its coverage area into different sectors, and then each sector is further divided into distinct groups based on the number of devices and their location information available from the cloud-center. Subsequently, individual groups within a sector are assigned to specific Random Access Window (RAW) slots, and the devices within distinct groups in different sectors access the allocated RAW slots by employing a spatial orthogonal access mechanism. The performance of the proposed sectorized device grouping scheme has been analyzed in terms of system delay and network throughput. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the network throughput while simultaneously decreasing the system delay as compared to the conventional Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and IEEE 802.11ah grouping scheme.},   keywords={Internet of Things;quality of service;radio networks;wireless LAN;packet collision rate;sector-based device grouping scheme;Access Point;IEEE 802.11ah;IoT networks;Random Access Window;IEEE 802.11ah grouping scheme;sectorized device grouping scheme;Delays;Throughput;Standards;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Media Access Protocol;MIMO communication},   doi={10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403521},   ISSN={2474-9133},   month={May},}

Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will involve symbiotic networks of people (social networks), smart devices, and smart phones or mobile personal computing and communication devices that will form net-centric societies or cyber-physical social systems. These devices - and the network - will be constantly sensing, monitoring, and interpreting the environment; this is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things (IOT). The symbiosis of IOT and social networks will have significant implications for both the market for advanced computing and communication infrastructure and the future markets - for nearly 4.5 billion people - that net-centric societies will create.

However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},   keywords={channel capacity;electromagnetic interference;game theory;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;Internet of vehicles;e-health applications;electromagnetic interference;EMI;power control algorithm;noncooperative game theoretic framework;channel capacity;best-response-dynamics algorithm;network-level optimal capacity;mobile hospital;Games;Electromagnetic interference;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Hospitals;Mobile handsets;E-health;game theory;mobile hospital;Nash equilibrium;power control},   doi={10.1109/JSYST.2015.2441720},   ISSN={1932-8184},   month={Sept},}

With elderly people as the main target, these conservative users pose a serious challenge to the successful implementation of smart home healthcare services. The objective of this research was to develop and test a theoretical framework empirically for determining the core factors that can affect the elderly users' acceptance of smart home services for healthcare. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people aged 55 years and above across four Asian countries. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the effect of eight hypothesized predicting constructs. The user perceptions were measured on a conceptual level rather than the actual usage intention toward a specific service. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, expert advice, and perceived trust have a positive impact on the behavioral intention. The same association is negative for technology anxiety and perceived cost. Facilitating conditions and social influence do not have any effect on the behavioral intention. The model could explain 81.4% of the total variance in the dependent variable i.e., behavioral intention. Effort expectancy is the leading predictor of smart homes for healthcare acceptance among the elderly. Together with expert advice, perceived trust, and perceived cost, these four factors represent the key influence of the elderly peoples' acceptance behavior. This paper provides the groundwork to explore the process of the actual adoption of smart home services for healthcare by the elderly people with potential future research areas.},   keywords={geriatrics;health care;home automation;human factors;Internet of Things;medical information systems;behavioral intention;effort expectancy;smart homes;healthcare acceptance;expert advice;perceived trust;perceived cost;end user perspective;Internet-of-Things;smart home solution;healthcare management;end user adoption;conservative users;smart home healthcare services;user perceptions;Senior citizens;Smart homes;Medical services;Wearable sensors;Bibliographies;Sensor systems;Elderly;healthcare;smart homes},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2808472},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'. This way a personalised monitoring plan (PMP) for each individual epilepsy patient can be realised.},   keywords={drugs;Internet of Things;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;surgery;IoT approach;epileptic seizure detection;drug resistant epilepsy;smart devices;personal patient data;epilepsy patients;data semantic;surgery;personalised monitoring plan;antiepileptic drugs;personalised remote monitoring;Internet-of-things;seizures;Epilepsy;Monitoring;Smart devices;Biomedical monitoring;Hospitals;Ontologies;personalised remote monitoring;epilepsy;healthcare;internet of things;smart device;information management;wearable technology},   doi={10.1109/ISPAN-FCST-ISCC.2017.34},   ISSN={2375-527X},   month={June},}

To address these problems, a healthcare system (HES) framework is designed that collects medical data from WBANs, transmits them through an extensive wireless sensor network infrastructure, and finally, publishes them into wireless personal-area networks via a gateway. Furthermore, HES involves the groups of send-receive model scheme to realize key distribution and secure data transmission, the homomorphic encryption based on matrix scheme to ensure privacy, and an expert system able to analyze the scrambled medical data and feedback the results automatically.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},   keywords={Medical services;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Servers;Prototypes;Senior citizens;Wireless communication;Context-aware data forwarding strategy;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);named data networking of things;NDN;NDNoT.},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723843},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={},}

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme.},   keywords={Medical services;Privacy;Sensors;Energy consumption;Energy harvesting;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Internet of Things;healthcare systems;mobile edge offloading;energy harvesting;privacy;reinforcement learning.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2875926},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients. We provide a prototype based on our architecture and discuss its salient features. We also provide use cases of our system in personalized and home based healthcare services. We propose an International Telecommunication Union based standardization (ITU-T) for our design and discuss future directions in wearable IoT.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;telemedicine;wearable IoT;ITU-T;International Telecommunication Union based standardization;home based healthcare services;personalized healthcare services;patient recovery cycles;healthcare service providers;primary healthcare centers;cloud computing;edge computing;smart bands;smartwatches;smartphones;health statistics;wearable devices;clinical integration;human activity tracking;wearable Internet of Things;Medical services;Cloud computing;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Tracking;Cloud Computing;Human Activities;Humans;Internet;Smartphone;Wearable Electronic Devices},   doi={10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037330},   ISSN={1558-4615},   month={July},}

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Servers;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Hospitals;Delays;Cloud computing;privacy;blindness;wireless body area networks (WBANs);Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141},   ISSN={1089-7798},   month={Nov},}

Due to the importance of the target applications in the daily life, BASNs are a promising candidate for being included into the future Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the data gathering of the human activity may help customizing the services provided by the IoT and thus dramatically improve the IoT user experience. Magnetic Induction (MI) based communication is known in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT), near-field communication (NFC), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in challenging environments. In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate. In this work, we analyze the potential of the distributed beamforming based MI-BASNs. We observe a significant increase of the achievable data rate for the proposed distributed beamforming compared to our selected baseline scheme.},   keywords={array signal processing;body area networks;body sensor networks;electromagnetic induction;health care;Internet of Things;MIMO communication;near-field communication;radiofrequency power transmission;distributed beamforming based MI-BASN;MIMO system;virtual multiple input multiple output system;WSN;NFC;near-field communication;WPT;wireless power transfer;MI based communication;IoT user experience improvement;human activity data gathering;Internet of Things;healthcare;magnetic induction based body area sensor network},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841737},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={A New Deep-Q-Learning-Based Transmission Scheduling Mechanism for the Cognitive Internet of Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2375-2385},   abstract={Cognitive networks (CNs) are one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where CNs will play an important role in the future Internet in several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based IoT (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process-based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.},   keywords={cognitive radio;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);scheduling;cognitive networks;crowded spectrum;wireless applications;cognitive technology;cognitive radio-based IoT;CIoT;IoT applications;system throughput;Markov decision process-based model;system utility;reinforcement learning method;Q learning algorithm;stacked auto-encoders deep learning model;power consumption;packet loss;cognitive Internet of Things;CN;deep-Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism;packet transmission efficiency;Internet of Things;Relays;Wireless sensor networks;Throughput;Bit error rate;Scheduling;Machine learning;Cognitive networks (CNs);deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);Markov decision process;Q learning (QL)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2759728},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data.

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;real-time healthcare monitoring;ubiquitous healthcare;u-healthcare systems;bluetooth;Zigbee;smart devices;IEEE802.15.4;interoperability problem;communication platform;next generation u-healthcare system;edge router;real-time monitoring;gateway application;TCP client;remote PC;TCP/IP;Internet of Things;Labview program;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Real-time systems;Protocols;Accelerometers;Temperature sensors;6LoWPAN;U-Healthcare;WSN;WBAN;IEEE802.15.4},   doi={10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

This paper proposes a hybrid security model for securing the diagnostic text data in medical images. The proposed model is developed through integrating either 2-D discrete wavelet transform 1 level (2D-DWT-1L) or 2-D discrete wavelet transform 2 level (2D-DWT-2L) steganography technique with a proposed hybrid encryption scheme. The proposed hybrid encryption schema is built using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard, and Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman algorithms. The proposed model starts by encrypting the secret data; then it hides the result in a cover image using 2D-DWT-1L or 2D-DWT-2L. Both color and gray-scale images are used as cover images to conceal different text sizes. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated based on six statistical parameters; the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), structural similarity (SSIM), structural content (SC), and correlation. The PSNR values were relatively varied from 50.59 to 57.44 in case of color images and from 50.52 to 56.09 with the gray scale images. The MSE values varied from 0.12 to 0.57 for the color images and from 0.14 to 0.57 for the gray scale images. The BER values were zero for both images, while SSIM, SC, and correlation values were ones for both images.

Since INFaaS is designed for generic purpose, its applicability and genericity should be verified in that sense. In this paper, we present a comprehensive case study of developing an IoT-based Personal Healthcare System with the INFaaS cloud framework. This system requires various inference algorithms to diagnose diseases with the acquired medical contexts, which will increase developers' overhead. We believe that a cloud service providing inference services such as INFaaS yields a tremendous benefits in terms of cost benefits.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;personal healthcare system;inference-as-a-service;IoT devices;cloud service;context-awareness;INFaaS cloud framework;Conferences;Service computing;Inference-as-a-Service;Personal Healthcare System;Disease Diagnosis;Inference},   doi={10.1109/SCC.2015.42},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

This poses heterogeneity in data syntax and semantics. In the past few years, researches have been carried out to handle these problems in various information systems such as water and healthcare by applying semantic and syntactic uniformity. This research presents an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework to sustain the interoperability between stakeholders within an information system by applying Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) paradigm and ontology. The major contribution of this research is building software model which is annotated with semantic model to maintain the comprehension between the modelers and the programmers allowing sustainability by adapting to the changing environment. Moreover, the framework offers two types of semantic validation i.e. model and data of the documents to integrate sensor data which we claim as a novelty in this study. The validated IoT data is integrated through RESTful web service interface of SensorThings API. The aim of this paper is to apply the methodology of the framework, on IoT based healthcare system, that has been successful in water information system.},   keywords={application program interfaces;data integration;health care;information systems;Internet;Internet of Things;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;software engineering;Web services;Internet of Things technology;IoT-based information systems;IoT technology;Information and Communication Technology framework;ICT framework;IoT based healthcare system;validated IoT data;sensor data;semantic validation i.e;sustainability;modelers;semantic model;software model;ontology;syntactic uniformity;semantic uniformity;semantics;data syntax;files;disparate databases;data integration;sustainable interoperability;water information system;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Interoperability;Ontologies;Medical services;Adaptation models;Software;Model Driven Software Development;Ontology;Healthcare systems;Semantic Validation;OGC SensorThings},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.126},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game to balance the tradeoff between network performance and security level while taking into account the context dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve an acceptable security level and is more efficient than benchmark algorithms in terms of network lifetime and throughput.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;patient care;quality of service;stochastic games;health domain;ubiquitous healthcare;constant monitoring;wireless body area network;highly suitable communication tool;medical IoT devices;WBAN applications;network lifetime;network throughput;data criticality;QoS requirements;stochastic game;network performance;acceptable security level;constrained wireless body area networks;security effectiveness;Security;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Quality of service;Games;Sensors;Adaptation models;IoT;Health;WBAN;Game theory;Nash Equilibrium Adaptive security;QoS requirements},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2018.8319222},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

The migration of data processing from local node, achieved by decoupling the node hardware from the required processing capabilities, is only possible through implementations of network softwarization. The softwarization which brings, new services that are executed remotely has led to security challenges, yet to be resolved, due to the increasing amount of data being continually exchanged between the sensor node-hub and the remote servers. In this regard we introduce a novel genetic algorithm for data security with a powerful security architecture that performs one-time key, single block enciphering instead of a block chaining or weak stream enciphering. The algorithm architecture produces variable (stealthy) keys and data that adopts white noise statistical behavior, therefore, having high immunity to cryptanalysis. The algorithm combines gene fusion and Horizontal Gene Transfer inspired from the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. A Salt extracted from the data block hash-value adds the stealthy-key feature to the cipher.

Hence, the use of Internet Protocol (IP) into LoWPAN has broadened new research area known as 6LoWPAN. Nowadays, 6LoWPAN technology is swiftly gaining recognition for its extensive application, ranging from healthcare to environmental monitoring. One of the challenges in 6LoWPAN is the route break often occurs due to node mobility, node failure and channel impairments. There are types of routing protocol that have been proposed to reroute or provide alternative routing to overcome the route break problem. However, the network is burdened of load RREQ the whole network. In this paper, we proposed LABC mechanism in the Local Route Repair using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm in 6LoWPAN network to enhance the routing against route breakage. We compare the packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay with scalable number of traffic and show that our routing protocol with LABC mechanism significantly reduce average end-to-end delay and increase number of packets delivery.},   keywords={optimisation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;Zigbee;LABC;local route repair;artificial bee colony algorithm;6LoWPAN network;Internet of Things;IEEE 802.15.4 standard;wireless sensor network;low power personal area network;routing protocol;alternative routing;route break problem;packet delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;Routing protocols;Maintenance engineering;Routing;Delays;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Wireless sensor networks;LABC;6L0WPANrouting;Swarm Intelligent},   doi={10.1109/ICCST.2014.7045181},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={171-176},   abstract={For the convenience of users, thousands of wearable devices with new built-in applications are appearing every year in the field of healthcare, sports, and safety. However, the system of them should be operated by using limited capacity of power because of very small size of battery that can be loaded into a wearable device due to the device properties. For such a reason, Chip Vendors are recently launching MCUs with ultra-low power capability on the market and also MCU that supports 7-step low power mode was appeared at present[1-3]. But now, it is very rare case to completely use Low Power Mode offered by MCU vendor on the operating system (OS) that is applied to wearable devices, and there is no case to support low power mode by the OS at the board level. Therefore, this paper suggests optimal supporting mechanism for ultra-low power multi-step mode at the OS level of wearable device. The mechanism proposed in this paper is largely divided into two parts. First, it is Low Power Mode Governor (LPMG) which is a module used to select an optimal low power mode after computation of retention time in idle mode. Second, we proposed Power-Off Mode, which disconnects power to the board when idle mode lasts for a long time. When integrating these two technologies and applying them to the Tickless nanoQplus[4], the OS for wearable devices developed at our lab, in the same Wearable Application Scenario 2 test, power consumption after passing a certain duration of time is reduced by 98.05% compared to idle mode, and 96.33% compared to sleep mode. These newly proposed two technologies will be able to offer an effective solution required to achieve low power consumption in wearable devices.},   keywords={operating systems (computers);multi level ultra low-power mode support mechanisms;wearable devices;operating system;OS level;low power mode governor;LPMG;power-off mode;Decision support systems;Conferences;Internet of Things;Green computing;Social computing;DPM;MCU;Low Power Mode;Wearable;RTOS},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.53},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The medical staff within these facilities are in an environment where they depend on immediately knowing the location of a patient or other medical staff. McAllister et al. [1] proposed a solution named LoCATE (Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment) which uses existing technology to track all patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current wireless networks (e.g., WiFi) within a healthcare facility by using edge node technology as its tracking solution. It can locate an object within three to five feet of its calculated position. The ubiquity of WiFi infrastructure in healthcare facilities makes it an attractive option to use, as the backbone for a patient and staff tracking system. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge nodes create security holes in networks and leak data to the open world. This paper aims to analyze what security holes and data leaks LoCATE creates in a healthcare facility. In this paper, we show the dangers of using simple and default passwords, the need to physically secure edge nodes, and the importance of securing data before transmission. We exploit the system's weak security measures by forging edge node data, gaining unauthorized access, performing denial of service attack, and launching other attacks.

The concerns are also realized by recent sophisticated security and privacy attacks, including data breaching, data integrity, and data collusion. Conventional solutions often offer security to patients’ health monitoring data during the communication. However, they often fail to deal with complicated attacks at the time of data conversion into cipher and after the cipher transmission. In this paper, we first study privacy and security concerns with healthcare data acquisition and then transmission. Then, we propose a secure data collection scheme for IoT based healthcare system named SecureData with the aim to tackle security concerns similar to the above. SecureData scheme is comprised of four layers: IoT network sensors/devices, Fog layers, Cloud computing layer, and healthcare provider layer. We mainly contribute to the first three layers. For the first two layers, SecureData includes two techniques: light-weight FPGA hardware-based cipher algorithm and secret cipher share algorithm, respectively. We study KATAN algorithm and we implement and optimize it on the FPGA hardware platform, while we use the idea of secret cipher sharing technique to protect patients’ data privacy. At the cloud computing layer, we apply a distributed database technique that includes a number of cloud data servers to guarantee patients’ personal data privacy at the cloud computing layer. The performance of SecureData is validated through simulations with FPGA in terms of hardware frequency rate, energy cost, and computation time of all the algorithms and the results show that SecureData can be efficient when applying for protecting security risks in IoT-based healthcare.},   keywords={Medical services;Ciphers;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Data collection;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;data collection;hardware-based security;threats;secret cipher;privacy;healthcare.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2854714},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={687-694},   abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have recently been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.},   keywords={application program interfaces;health care;medical computing;medical disorders;mobile computing;pattern recognition;Alzimio app;dementia;autism;Alzheimers disorder;activity recognition algorithms;mobile app;safe-zone geofencing;smartphones;threshold-based algorithms;Android API;max-in-window algorithm;Smart phones;Sensors;Autism;Dementia;Algorithm design and analysis},   doi={10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501720},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

However, the actual inner temperature gradient in the thermoelectric legs is relatively small when a TEG is worn on the body, which leads to a low voltage and power generation. To enhance the output performance, the structural design of a wearable TEG with copper foam as the heat sink is proposed. A thermal resistance model was developed to investigate the effects of using copper foam heat sink on the heat transfer and performance of the TEG. In addition, for comparison, the inner temperature gradients and open-circuit voltages of the TEGs with and without plate-fin heat sink were analyzed. Then, these different TEGs were fabricated and tested using an experimental setup. The results showed that TEGs with heat sinks could generate greater open-circuit voltage and output power values, while the TEG with copper-foam heat sink achieved the highest power-to-weight ratio. Finally, a wearable TEG with copper-foam heat sink was connected to a step-up circuit and worn on the wrist to power a miniaturized accelerometer for body motion detection. The results demonstrated that the wearable TEG with the copper-foam heat sink design provided a potential pathway for the realization of electronics powered by harvesting the human body heat.},   keywords={Heat sinks;Heat transfer;Copper;Resistance heating;Thermal resistance;Legged locomotion;Copper foam;heat sink;power-to-weight ratio;thermal resistance model;wearable TEG},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2863018},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={720-725},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage.

IoT applications make use of inherently distributed processing. In such networks-of-systems (NoS), computation and communication is tightly coupled. Traditional design of networks and systems in isolation ignores how choices in one influence the other, and approaches for joint network/system co-exploration are lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel prototyping platform to enable comprehensive NoS design space exploration. Fast and accurate host-compiled system models are combined with a standard network simulator to provide a unified network/system co-simulation framework. Furthermore, detailed models of network interfaces and protocol stacks are integrated into host-compiled system and OS models to allow accurately capturing of network and system interactions. We apply our NoS simulator to two case studies from smart camera and healthcare application domains, and we demonstrate benefits and opportunities for exploration and optimization in network/system co-design. Results indicate that, depending on application, network and system configurations, application throughput can vary by an average of 26%, while device core utilization can vary by as much as 130%.

The limitation of sensor node is in terms of resources namely storage, power, processing potential and communication range. For the sensor network to be operational an efficient routing algorithm to forward the arriving packets is essential The data transferred by the nodes will be redundant in most of the scenarios. Selecting the optimal route for data transmission is one of the vital factors from the perspective view point of a routing protocol In order to eliminate the redundancy of data and to enhance the QoS parameters, Statistical Ad-hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (S-AODV) routing protocol is proposed in this paper. This new protocol is analyzed with respect to each layer by taking QoS metrics and statistical parameters in to consideration. A comparative study reveals that the proposed protocol performs better than the present AODV protocol.},   keywords={quality of service;routing protocols;statistical analysis;vectors;wireless sensor networks;communication technology;wireless sensor network;WSN;sensor node;routing algorithm;optimal route;data transmission;quality of service;QoS parameters;statistical ad-hoc ondemand distance vector;S-AODV routing protocol;QoS metrics;statistical parameters;Wireless sensor networks;Correlation;Quality of service;Measurement;Throughput;Routing protocols;Routing protocol;S-AODV;Layered analysis;Correlation coefficient},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380612},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

There is no debate among security experts that the security of Internet-enabled medical devices is crucial, and an ongoing threat vector is insider attacks. In this paper, we focus on the identification of insider attacks in healthcare SDNs. Specifically, we survey stakeholders from 12 healthcare organizations (i.e., two hospitals and two clinics in Hong Kong, two hospitals and two clinics in Singapore, and two hospitals and two clinics in China). Based on the survey findings, we develop a trust-based approach based on Bayesian inference to figure out malicious devices in a healthcare environment. Experimental results in either a simulated and a real-world network environment demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach regarding the detection of malicious healthcare devices, i.e., our approach could decrease the trust values of malicious devices faster than similar approaches.},   keywords={Bayes methods;computer network security;health care;inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;medical information systems;software defined networking;trusted computing;insider attacks;healthcare software-defined networks;medical industry;network control;medical devices;healthcare SDNs;Bayesian inference;malicious devices;healthcare environment;real-world network environment;malicious healthcare devices;Bayesian-based trust management;Internet of Medical Things environment;Medical services;Organizations;Wireless sensor networks;Security;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;software-defined networking;trust computation and management;healthcare network;Bayesian inference},   doi={10.1109/TNSM.2018.2815280},   ISSN={1932-4537},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={849-854},   abstract={With the increase in popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), pervasive computing, healthcare services, sensor networks, and mobile devices, a lot of data is being generated at the perception layer. Cloud is the most viable solution for data storage, processing, and management. Cloud also helps in the creation of further services, refined according to the context and requirement. However, being reachable through the Internet, cloud is not efficient enough for latency sensitive multimedia services and other time-sensitive services, like emergency and healthcare. Fog, an extended cloud lying within the proximity of underlying nodes, can mitigate the issues traditional cloud cannot solve being standalone. Fog can provide quick response to the requiring applications. Moreover, it can preprocess and filter data according to the requirements. Trimmed data is then sent to the cloud for further analysis and enhanced service provisioning. However, how much better is it to have a fog in any particular scenario instead of a standalone cloud working without fog is a question right now. In this paper, we provide an answer by analyzing both cloud-only and cloud-fog scenarios in the context of processing delay and power consumption according to increasing number of users, on the basis of varying server load. The simulation is done through Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). Simulation results demonstrate that by the use of fog networks, users experienced lower waiting times and increased data rates.},   keywords={cloud computing;data handling;discrete event systems;file servers;multimedia computing;power aware computing;Web services;DEVS;fog computing environment modeling;fog computing environment simulation;Internet of Things;IoT;pervasive computing;healthcare services;sensor networks;mobile devices;perception layer;data storage;data processing;data management;Internet;latency sensitive multimedia services;time-sensitive services;extended cloud computing;enhanced service provisioning;cloud-only scenarios;cloud-fog scenarios;processing delay;power consumption;discrete event system specification;fog networks;Fog computing;cloud computing;performance evaluation;Simulation;DEVS},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2017.7876242},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

 title={PESA: Probabilistic Efficient Storage Algorithm for Time-Domain Spectrum Measurements}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Wireless communication is an essential part of daily life for users globally with applications in medical devices, cellular phones, Internet of Things nodes, and others. Accordingly, there is a need to understand the patterns and properties of radio-frequency spectrum use by acquiring accurate spectrum utilization measurements. However, the massive storage volume needed to execute spectrum surveys-especially when a fast sampling rate is used--is an impeding factor in terms of cost and ease-of-access. In this paper, a probabilistic efficient storage algorithm (PESA) is proposed to facilitate high-accuracy, time-domain spectrum surveys conducted at a fast sample acquisition rate to detect sporadic spectrum occupancy patterns that could be in the order of microseconds. PESA divides the dynamic range of monitoring equipment into bins--each represented by one component of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Windows of activity and inactivity in the measurements are established by comparing with a threshold, and then indicators to the GMM component that best describes a window are recorded, hence reducing the required storage volume. Results demonstrate that ≈99% reduction in the storage volume is achievable while maintaining an accurate estimation of channel utilization (CU) and activity/inactivity periods. Furthermore, a LabVIEW implementation of PESA on a hardware platform was executed and used to survey Wi-Fi channel 1 in a healthcare environment for seven consecutive hours. Although more than 25 billion samples were observed, the resulting data only occupied 96.28 MB.},   keywords={Wireless communication;Time-domain analysis;Wireless fidelity;Volume measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Time-frequency analysis;Cognitive radio;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Internet of Things (IoT);spectrum survey;Wi-Fi;wireless coexistence},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2018.2851678},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={},}

IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular.

Network operators must integrate to their architecture pro-active tools able to detect and signal these anomalous patterns and then mitigate the issue of overloaded base-stations. We address in this paper the issue of eHealth services by analyzing at first their impact on cellular networks. We propose also an on-line and efficient anomaly detection technique for eHealth data based on support vector regression (SVR). Moreover, we validate our model with a real dataset of cellular call detail records (CDR) combined with semi-synthetic eHealth dataset. A realistic testbed is provided on the context of a Marathon event where mobile users are running eHealth applications.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;next generation networks;radio networks;regression analysis;support vector machines;telemedicine;Internet of things;support vector regression;cellular architecture;eHealth services;next generation cellular networks;eHealth-enabled data;proactive anomaly detection model;eHealth applications;semisynthetic eHealth dataset;cellular call detail records;Electronic healthcare;Anomaly detection;Cellular networks;Telecommunications;Prediction algorithms;Base stations;Real-time systems},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422516},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

Computation and infotainment are the two major areas where Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) electronics have made major contributions. Moving forward we expect to see their dominance in automotive applications. At the same time, we are seeing increased interest in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect trillions of sensors. We are preparing for Internet of Everything (IoE) applications where people, process, data and devices are going to be connected through new generation of electronics which are not possible today. Therefore, our research is focused on hybrid integration of heterogeneous materials, processes and devices to build free form (flexible, stretchable, reconfigurable in shape and size) interactive and high-performance electronics and systems for smart living and a sustainable future focusing on healthcare, water, food and environment. For scientific exploration, we develop integration strategy to make collective use of the materials, processes and device architecture leveraging multidisciplinary tracks of electrical engineering, material science, bioengineering, computer science and engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering (focusing plants and marine science) and health science. As engineering tool, we use CMOS technology extensively due to its industrial relevance, maturity and reliability for rapid tech transfer.

 title={The Accuracy and Efficacy of Real-Time Compressed ECG Signal Reconstruction on a Heterogeneous Multicore Edge-Device}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={458-463},   abstract={Typical real-time remote health monitoring architectures consist of wearable medical devices continuously transmitting physiological signals to a nearby gateway which routes the data to an remote internet of things (IoT)-platform. Unfortunately, this model falls-short under the strict requirements of healthcare systems. Wearable medical devices have short battery lifespans, the system reliance on a cloud makes it vulnerable to connectivity and latency issues, and there are privacy concerns related to streaming sensitive medical data to remote servers. The compressive sensing (CS) scheme has been explored in the context of bio-signals to reduce the energy consumption of wearable sensors. However, CS does not address the other limitations caused by the model's reliance on cloud-computing but exacerbates the associated computing latency by requiring a computationally complex reconstruction process. In our remote elderly monitoring system, we attempt to address this weakness by developing a gateway-centric connected health system, where most signal processing and analysis occurs locally on heterogeneous multicore edge-devices. This paper explores the efficacy of real-time reconstruction of ECG signals, compressed under the CS scheme, on an IoT-gateway powered by ARM's big. LITTLE multicore solution at different signal dimension and allocated computational resources. Experimental results show the gateway's capability to reconstruct ECG signals in real-time, even when considering dimensionally large windows and minimum computational resources. Moreover, they demonstrate that utilizing more cores for the reconstruction process has a higher impact on execution time and is more energy efficient than increasing the cores' frequency. The optimal resource allocation for the majority of cases is a single big (A15) core at minimum frequency as it provides extreme fast reconstruction while consuming less or slightly more energy than its LITTLE (A7) counterpart. Heterogeneous multicore devices have the computational capacity and energy efficiency to elevate some of the limitations of a cloud-based remote health monitoring and can help create a more sustainable IoT-based connected health.},   keywords={Multicore processing;Real-time systems;Electrocardiography;Sensors;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Microsoft Windows;Remote health monitoring;connected health;compressive sensing;heterogeneous multicore platforms;edge computing},   doi={10.1109/DSD.2018.00082},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Also, a lot of analytical information is generated in this process which is of extreme use in determining what changes should be made in which area. Building an IoT blueprint for a city is actually a very complex job due to the variety of smart devices present.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={858-862},   abstract={As a new research area, Digital Forensics is a subject in a rapidly developing society. Cyber Security for Big Data in the Cloud is getting more attention than ever. A computing breach requires digital forensics to seize digital evidence to determine who is responsible and what has been done maliciously and the possible further consequences. In particular, for Big Data attack cases, Digital Forensics is facing even more challenge for earlier digital breach investigations. For the PPI (Protection of Personal Information) a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law has been launched to be implemented from the 25<sup>th</sup>May 2018. This compulsory regulation will have an important impact on healthcare PPI in the cloud (ICO, 2017, Deloitte, 2014). Nowadays, Big Data with the characteristics of three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and Variety), are either synchronized with the Cloud, or stored in the Cloud, in order to solve the storage capacity and so on problems, which made Digital Forensics investigation even more difficult. The Big Data Digital Forensics issue for the Cloud is difficult. One of them is the need to identify which physical devices have been compromised. Data are distributed in the Cloud, so the customer or digital forensics practitioner cannot have full access control like the traditional investigation does. Smart City are making use of ICT (information communications technology) to collect, detect, analyze and integrate the key information data of core systems in running the cities. Meanwhile, the Control Centre is making intelligent responses to different requirements that include daily livelihood, PPI security, environmental protection, public safety, industrial and commercial activities and city services. The Smart City healthcare Big Data are collected and gathered by the IoT (Internet of Things) (Liu, 2014, Qi, 2016) and applying GDPR prevent Cyberstalking and Cybercrimes.

To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort.

Thus, a new generation of smart wearable devices for health monitoring is being developed, able to perform complex Digital Signal Processing (DSP) routines that extract features of clinical relevance from the acquired data. These new edge computing sensors for personalized healthcare must operate within a tight energy envelope; addressing the ensuing challenge, we herein introduce an inexact and heterogeneous edge computing architecture, specifically tailored to the bio-DSP domain. We observe that bio-signal analysis applications present task-level parallelism, intensive computational hotspots and a high degree of resilience towards errors. These characteristics drive our new bio-DSP edge node architecture design composed of multiple processing cores, a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerator, and hardware-software co-design support to become resilient to a non-zero probability of bit-flips at runtime. All these characteristics enable our new bio-DSP architecture to operate with an ultra-low voltage operating point. Indeed our results indicate that the energy benefits attained from the inclusion of all these characteristics in bio-DSP architectures are more than additive: task parallelism is harnessed both at the processor and the accelerator level, and the high tolerance of the CGRA towards voltage down-scaling is exploited to further decrease the IoT edge bio-DSP system energy envelope.},   keywords={Kernel;Random access memory;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Runtime;Synchronization;Sensors},   doi={10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351595},   ISSN={2379-447X},   month={May},}

This digital transformation is paving the way to new forms of care based on real-time analysis of huge amounts of data produced by sensors, which is seen as a basis for improving clinical efficiency and helping to save lives. A medical sensor typically produces several KBs of data per second so the collection and analysis of these data can be approached with Big Data technologies. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate a hybrid architecture for real-time anomaly detection from data streams coming from sensors attached to patients. The architecture includes an edge computing data staging platform based on Raspberry Pi 3 for data logging, data transformation in RDF triple and data streaming towards a cluster computing running Apache Kafka for collecting RDFStreams, Apache Flink for running a parallel version of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm and Cassandra for data storing.

 title={Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={99-104},   abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},   keywords={application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;open systems;real-time systems;secure health care services;OAuth 2.0;JSON Web token;IoT cloud scenario;authorization framework;real time clinical care;automatic monthly payments;bank account;phishing attack;interoperable API;Medical services;Authorization;Servers;Authentication;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;OAuth 2.0;Json Web Token;IOT;Authorization},   doi={10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

This creates the need for continuous data streaming in IoT architectures which are mainly designed following the broadcast model. As more devices communicate with each other via the Internet, it will be crucial to determine the origins of requests and responses. Being able to store records related to the life cycle of requests and responses in an immutable form will provide documentary evidence that will help to establish transparency and accountability within the IoT. Previous works employed provenance techniques to address this problem but focus on the request perspective. However, little or nothing has been done regarding the response perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes and develops a blockchain-based provenance system to trace bi-directionally the sources of requests and responses in the IoT.

This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS) -in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics -has always been the main challenge in designing such systems. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a five-layered heterogeneous mist, fog, and cloud based IoHT framework capable of efficiently handling and routing (near-)real-time as well as offline/batch mode data. Also, by employing software defined networking and link adaptation based load balancing, the framework ensures optimal resource allocation and efficient resource utilization. The results, obtained by simulating the framework, indicate that the designed network via its various components can achieve high QoS, with reduced end-to-end latency and packet drop rate, which is essential for developing next generation e-healthcare systems.},   keywords={Medical services;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Quality of service;Monitoring;Healthcare big data;healthcare application;data fusion;real-time computing;resource allocation;quality of service;load balancing.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876088},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats.

Addition of enormous number of M2M devices into the cellular networks poses a heavy competition to existing Human-to-Human (H2H) devices for getting radio resources, thereby affecting the performance of the H2H communications. But, one can not treat all M2M flows as low priority and schedule them after H2H flows, as there are many M2M applications like healthcare and tracking which are of high importance and delay-intolerant. Hence, there is a need for class based priority scheduling of the traffic of M2M and H2H sessions in the network.

Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency.

Due to time constraint, people are not visiting hospitals, which might and possibly lead to a lot of health issues in one instant of time. Predominantly most of the healthcare systems have been developed to predict and diagnose the health of the patients by which people who are busy in their schedule can also monitor their health at regular intervals. Many studies show that early prediction is the best way to cure health because early diagnosis will help and alert the patients to know the health status.

With the increasing use of technology, there is an urgent need to have such a smart health monitoring system that can communicate between network devices and application which will help the patients and doctors to monitor, track and record the patient's sensitive data containing medical information. This paper depicts the idea of solving health issues using the latest technology, Internet of Things (IoT). It presents the architectural review of smart healthcare system using Internet of Things(IoT) which is aimed to provide a Better HealthCare to everyone. Using this system architecture, patient's body parameters can be measured in real time. Sensors collect patients body parameters and transfers that data to Microcontroller ATMEL 89s52 which further transfer that data to the MySQL database server. This MySQL database server manages the data and provides accessibility. The patient can view this data with the help of Android App. Which one can install in Smartphone, or Tablet. If data is abnormal then patient gets notification also care takers will get emergency message. With the help of different decision making algorithms decisions can be made easily and fast and according to it people can have access to the database.

 title={Evolution of wireless sensor networks towards the Internet of Things: A survey}, 
  year={2011},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage.

Devices in IoT applications such as smart healthcare applications deal with sensitive data of our health and daily lives and thus can execute malicious actuating commands with serious safety consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure secure communication channel establishment among the medical sensors or devices and the remote servers. In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is energy efficient.},   keywords={accelerometers;body area networks;body sensor networks;cryptographic protocols;data protection;Internet of Things;message authentication;smart phones;trusted computing;message authentication;IoT applications;secure communication channel;medical sensors;medical devices;remote servers;key agreement protocol;resource-constrained sensors;sensitive health related data protection;heavy cryptographic functions;trustful neighboring sensors;trust verification;data correlations;embedded accelerometers;smartphone;security analysis;performance evaluation;energy efficient protocol;Internet of Things based resource-constrained body area sensors;Internet of Things (IoT);Accelerometers;Data Correlation;Security;Key Management;Body Area Networks;Resource-constrained;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.70},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

This paper provides an overview of these advances. Also, we propose an IoT-based surveillance system for ubiquitous healthcare monitoring. The system consists of sensors, actuators, and cameras. Mesh topology was decided to be used as it provides important advantages. Moreover, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used for the data compression and transferring, and the Scalable High-Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) is used for the video compression and transferring. The SHVC can deliver the same video quality in half of the bit rate than the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Furthermore, cloud services are provided, such as storage and real-time monitoring. Finally, we made a comparative analysis between our proposed system architecture and two other approaches. From this analysis, we can say that our system architecture has some benefits instead of other similar architectures. Also, we made an analysis of the bandwidth and the network throughput.

Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},   keywords={Big Data;cognitive systems;fault tolerant computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;model-driven methodology;autonomic cognitive IoT-based systems;health care;Internet of Things;autonomic cognitive design patterns;smart IoT-based systems;Big Data;scalability management;system functional requirements;system nonfunctional requirements;cognitive monitoring system;patient health management;heterogeneous wearable devices;heterogeneous large-scale data stream integration;heterogeneous large-scale data stream processing;system performance evaluation;response time;Scalability;Monitoring;Big Data;Complexity theory;Complex systems;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Autonomic computing;big data;cognitive computing;design patterns;IoT-based system},   doi={10.1109/TETCI.2017.2699218},   ISSN={2471-285X},   month={June},}

 title={Edge Mesh: A New Paradigm to Enable Distributed Intelligence in Internet of Things}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={16441-16458},   abstract={In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={871-876},   abstract={Lifelogging physical activity (PA) assessment is crucial to healthcare technologies and studies for the purpose of treatments and interventions of chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies.

The rapid development of IoT and vast expansion of wireless technologies unfold the new chances of growth in several domains such as, Education, Transportation, Agriculture, and especially in the Healthcare sector. Introducing the IoT through healthcare applications fetch several benefits, including cost savings through lowered hospital visiting costs, health care provider costs, transportation costs, human resource costs and the insurance costs. It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT. There is a great need to design and develop a lightweight secure authentication model, which offers significant security level against multiple attacks such as mainly: Impersonation attacks, man in the middle attack and unknown key sharing attacks for IoT base E-health domain.

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile computing;social networking (online);social sciences computing;social persuasion;online network;physical network;interpersonal trust;data-driven analysis;Internet of Things;big data;smartphone;cyber world;Market research;Social network services;Media;Context modeling;Internet;Global Positioning System;Public policy;Design methodology;Algorithm design and analysis;Internet of things;Complex networks;Medical services;Social factors;Behavioral science;Cyber–physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion;Cyber–physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion},   doi={10.1109/JPROC.2014.2363986},   ISSN={0018-9219},   month={Dec},}

The recent introduction of Fog computing architecture provides an efficient platform for delay sensitive IoT applications. Exploiting the advantages of Fog computing for anomaly detection provides the ability to detect abnormal patterns in an accurate and timely manner. Use of Centralized and Distributed anomaly detection methods suffer from significant latency and energy consumption issues. Hence, we propose a novel anomaly detection method, called Fog-Empowered anomaly detection, by harnessing the processing power of the Fog computing platform and using an efficient hyperellipsoidal clustering algorithm. The end nodes in the Fog computing architecture do not perform any processing or clustering on the data. The Fog layer and the Cloud layer nodes perform the clustering and anomaly detection process, thus helping to achieve anomaly detection in a timely manner. The evaluation using synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach achieves a significant reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to the Distributed and Centralized schemes, while achieving a comparable detection accuracy compared to a Centralized scheme.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;security of data;Fog computing architecture;delay sensitive IoT applications;anomaly detection process;time-critical Internet of Things applications;fog-empowered anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal clustering algorithm;cloud layer nodes;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Ellipsoids;Internet of Things;Computer architecture;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Anomaly detection;Fog computing;hyperellipsoidal clustering;Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2709942},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism.

There has been sustained research work and standardization effort from different IoT perspectives like integration of sensor and RFID devices to the Internet. With the increasing trend of gathering business insights from unstructured data, the high volume of data generated by such devices is also of interest. Cloud based data mining platforms are suitable for analyses of such data and researchers have proposed architectures where personal mobile phones can act as Edge Gateway between the sensor network and cloud analytics platform.

We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},   keywords={inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;meta data;ubiquitous computing;visual programming;Internet of Things;ubiquitous computing;smart environment;service composition system;goal-driven configuration;semantic metadata;reasoning;visual modeling tool;process-driven approach;service mashups;embedded semantic API descriptions;application program interfaces;smart homes;Semantics;Mashups;Visualization;Manufacturing;Internet of things;Protocols;Context;Internet of Things;semantic technologies;service composition;smart factory;smart home;web of things},   doi={10.1109/TASE.2016.2533321},   ISSN={1545-5955},   month={July},}

The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters.

In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover.

These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study.

This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={523-530},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an ubiquitous concept where physical objects are connected over the internet and are provided with unique identifiers to enable their self-identification to other devices and the ability to transmit data over the network. Sensor nodes along with their heterogeneous nature are the main part of the IoT and may act as internet hosts or clients. Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication. By using this protocol, resource-constrained nodes can also benefit from the same security functionalities that are typical of unconstrained domains, without however having to execute computationally intensive operations. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic operations of constrained nodes to the neighboring trusted nodes or devices. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is sufficiently energy efficient.},   keywords={biosensors;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;message authentication;private key cryptography;secure end-to-end key establishment protocol;resource-constrained healthcare sensors;IoT context;Internet of Things;physical objects;Internet connection;Internet hosts;Internet clients;communication security;end-users privacy protection;IP-enabled sensor nodes;secret key distribution;heterogeneous sensors;cryptographic primitives;healthcare applications;strong encryption;authentication;resource-constrained nodes;computationally intensive operations;security analysis;performance evaluation;energy efficiency;Decision support systems;Internet of Things (IoT);Security;Key Management;Healthcare;Resource-constrained;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568379},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

One of the established applications of WSN is localization of moving objects, which is integral part of monitoring, surveillance, intrusion detection and target tracking. For localizing a moving object in WSNs, generally, a set of location-aware static WSN nodes are used to localize the mobile nodes or moving target using a specific localization algorithm. RSSI and Trilateration based location identification is a well-known traditional method which needs distance calculation prior to localization. Many researchers have modified the traditional trilateration method to better suit their application or in general. In this paper we present, a modified trilateration method, which uses our application specific cooperative technique with better choice of beacon node placement to improve distance calculation method. The distance values are then used to expedite the trilateration process. The proposed technique has been simulated and compared with the traditional method.

State-of-the-art algorithms suffer from two issues: computation intensive features and large internal memory requirement, which make them inapplicable for constrained devices. We reduce the memory requirement of our algorithm by reducing the size of data segments (i.e. the window of input stream data on which the processing is performed), and the number of required EEG channels. To respect the limitations of the processing capability, we reduce the complexity of our exploited features by only considering the simple features, which also contributes to reducing the memory requirements. Then, we provide new relevant features to compensate the information loss due to the simplifications (i.e. less number of channels, simpler features, shorter segment, etc.). We measured the energy consumption (12.41 mJ) and execution time (565 ms) for processing each segment (i.e. 5.12 seconds of EEG data) on a low-power MSP432 device.

Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and accessed by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while preventing unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system that supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},   keywords={authorisation;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;medical file;timely access;emergency medical care;healthcare IoT network;lightweight break-glass access control system;patient care;medical devices;healthcare IoT measure patients;healthcare workers;unauthorized access;patient files;emergency situations;medical worker;access policy;emergent situations;break-glass access mechanism;healthcare Internet-of-Things;Access control;Medical services;Cryptography;Biomedical imaging;Informatics;Hip;Cloud computing;Access control;break-glass;healthcare system;lightweight;secure Internet-of-Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2017.2751640},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Aug},}

Body area networks are quickly becoming increasingly important in the world of healthcare with wide application in the treatment and monitoring of chronic patients using on-body devices. Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys. We show that these measurements results in derived keys that are unpredictable and exhibit significant difference with previous keys. This is an improvement over existing schemes where keys vary for different hosts but tend to be similar over time.},   keywords={ad hoc networks;body area networks;body sensor networks;cryptography;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;motion measurement;patient monitoring;patient treatment;telecommunication security;telemedicine;wearable security;body area sensor network;host movement;Internet-of-Things;ad-hoc connections;security parameter negotiation;shared key derivation;BAN;healthcare;chronic patient treatment;chronic patient monitoring;on-body devices;response time;emergency situation;patient complication detection;motion sensors;physiological signals;physical access;electrocardiograms;ECG;secure communication;device communication;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Monitoring;Body area networks;Frequency measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Authentication;Key Derivation;Physiology;Internet-of-Things;User-Centric;Security},   doi={10.1109/ISIE.2016.7745050},   ISSN={2163-5145},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Future Internet of Things (IoT) networks are expected to support a massive number of heterogeneous devices/sensors in diverse applications ranging from eHealthcare to industrial control systems. In highly-dense deployment scenarios such as industrial IoT systems, providing reliable communication links with low-latency becomes challenging due to the involved system delay including data acquisition and processing latencies at the edge-side of IoT networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a priority-based channel access and data aggregation scheme at the Cluster Head (CH) to reduce channel access and queuing delays in a clustered industrial IoT network. First, a prioritized channel access mechanism is developed by assigning different Medium Access Control (MAC) layer attributes to the packets coming from two types of IoT nodes, namely, high-priority and low-priority nodes, based on the application-specific information provided from the cloud-center. Subsequently, a preemptive M/G/1 queuing model is employed by using separate low-priority and high- priority queues before sending aggregated data to the Cloud. Our results show that the proposed priority-based method significantly improves the system latency and reliability as compared to the non-prioritized scheme.},   keywords={access protocols;cellular radio;channel allocation;data acquisition;data aggregation;industrial control;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;queueing theory;wireless IoT;data aggregation;diverse applications;industrial control systems;highly-dense deployment scenarios;industrial IoT systems;reliable communication links;involved system delay including data acquisition;processing latencies;IoT networks;Cluster Head;queuing delays;clustered industrial IoT network;prioritized channel access mechanism;IoT nodes;low-priority nodes;application-specific information;preemptive M/G/1 queuing model;high- priority queues;aggregated data;Future Internet of Things networks;heterogeneous devices;Medium Access Control layer;Delays;Data aggregation;Media Access Protocol;Logic gates;Reliability;Data models;Cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8255038},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Based on the traditional dictionary learning methods, which neglects the relationship between the sample and the dictionary atom, we propose the weighted mechanism to connect the sample with the dictionary atom in this paper. Meanwhile, the traditional dictionary learning method is prone to cause over-fitting for patient classification of the limited training data set. Therefore, this paper adopts l<sub>2</sub>-norm regularization constraint, which realizes the limitation of the model space, and enhances the generalization ability of the model and avoids over-fitting to some extent. Compared with the previous shallow dictionary learning, this paper proposed the greedy deep dictionary learning. We adopt the thinking of layer by layer training to increase the hidden layer, so that the local information between the layer and the layer can be trained to maintain their own characteristics, reduce the risk of overfitting and make sure that each layer of the network is convergent, which improves the accuracy of training and learning. With the development of Internet of Things and the soundness of healthcare monitoring system, the method proposed have better reliability in the field of mobile multimedia for healthcare. The results show that the learning method has a good effect on the classification of mobile multimedia for medical diseases, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classification have good performance, which may provide guidance for the diagnosis of disease in wisdom medical.},   keywords={diseases;greedy algorithms;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;mobile computing;multimedia systems;pattern classification;greedy deep learning method;medical disease analysis;greedy deep weighted dictionary;mobile multimedia;medical diseases analysis;traditional dictionary learning method;dictionary atom;greedy deep dictionary learning;shallow dictionary learning;patient classification;l2-norm regularization constraint;Internet of Things;healthcare;disease diagnosis;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Big Data;Medical services;Dictionaries;Training;Medical big data;machine learning;mobile multimedia;deep learning;dictionary learning;patient classification},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823979},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},   keywords={handicapped aids;health care;Internet;Internet of things;ambient assisted living;technological advancements;keep in touch;near field communication;radio frequency identification;closed loop healthcare services;telemonitoring processes;KIT technology;people-to-people communication;smart homes;Senior citizens;Radiofrequency identification;Medical services;Ambient intelligence;Pervasive computing;Web and internet services;Safety;Communications technology;IP networks;Decision making;eHealth;Pervasive Healthcare;Telemedicine;Near Field Communication (NFC);RFID},   doi={10.1109/ITNG.2010.104},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

 title={Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers}, 
  year={2017},   volume={60},   number={1},   pages={4-23},   abstract={Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},   keywords={health care;home computing;Internet of Things;patient care;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;patients adoption;WSN-based smart home healthcare system;patient-centered care;smart telecommunication technology;Internet of Things;wireless sensor network;generic technology adoption model;WSN-SHHS research;WSN-SHHS application;technology adoption theory;pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model;home healthcare agency;home healthcare patient;Kvale approach;human detachment;life-quality expectancy;predictive power accounting;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Context modeling;Predictive models;Smart homes;Collaboration;Technological innovation;Internet of things;smart home healthcare systems;usability;wireless-sensor network},   doi={10.1109/TPC.2016.2632822},   ISSN={0361-1434},   month={March},}

A huge number of connected heterogeneous devices and enormous amounts of data generated by these devices are not only difficult to manage but providing services with them in a dynamic IoT environment, count for significant efforts. There is a requirement for mechanisms that not only cater the heterogeneity of IoT devices but also provide dynamic services efficiently based on user requirements.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Over 125,000 Americans die annually from not taking medication properly. Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.},   keywords={Android (operating system);biomedical electronics;Bluetooth;computerised instrumentation;consumer electronics;drugs;microcontrollers;autonomous pill dispenser;tablet medication delivery mechanization;Arduino-controlled consumer device;textured cone;Android application;HC-06 Bluetooth module;serial activation signal;pill type;pill diameter;SMS notification;Androids;Humanoid robots;Bluetooth;DC motors;Servomotors;Consumer electronics;Testing;Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Robotic and Autonomous systems;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Arduino;Mobile computing;Wireless computing;Bluetooth integration;Patient care;Microcontroller;Medication control;Medication scheduling;Internet of Things;Android;Application},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777886},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={386-387},   abstract={Fog computing is a recently proposed computing paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for time-sensitive healthcare applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early notification of emergency situations to support smart decision making. While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications. In this work, we present dynamic Fog, a high level programming model for time-sensitive applications that are geospatially distributed, large-scale, and latency-sensitive. We also analyze our fog model with healthcare data, more specifically with Heartrate data that is one of the most time-sensitive medical data which deals with life and death situations. Our experiments show that our proposed system achieves minimum delay while it also achieves the data accuracy and data consistency which are very important in many applications like medical data.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;mobile handsets;fog networks;cloud computing;time-sensitive healthcare applications;smart decision making;real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system;fog-based cloud paradigm;time-sensitive medical applications;mobile devices;sensor devices;Internet of Things;IoT;future Internet applications;heartrate data;data accuracy;data consistency;medical data;Medical services;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Logic gates;Delays;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Fog networks; Healthcare data; IoT; Delay;},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2016.065},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

Many of these challenges are similar to those existing for IoT architectures (i.e., interoperability) and others are derived from the healthcare domain (e.g., patients and caregivers as end-users). In this paper, we present a survey of secondary studies on AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017. Our focus resided in investigating the state-of-the-art of the adaptive AAL platforms for older adults assistance.

The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Our initial numerical results show a reduction of the handoff costs on the mobile router which normally constitute a bottleneck in such a system. We also discuss important metrics such as signaling overload, bandwidth efficiency and power consumption and how they can be optimized through the mobility management.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;IP networks;low-power electronics;mobility management (mobile radio);patient monitoring;personal area networks;power consumption;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication signalling;transport protocols;wireless sensor networks;network mobility solution;NEMO-HWSN;IPv6 low-power personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;mobility support;large-scale IP-based sensor technology;hospital wireless network;6LoWPAN application;patient monitoring;patient vital signs;mobility management;patient nodes-hospital network connectivity;fault tolerance;energy consumption;IPv6 mobility protocols;hospital architecture;handoff cost reduction;mobile router;signaling overload;bandwidth efficiency;power consumption;wireless sensor network;health care;Hospitals;Mobile communication;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks;Internet;Monitoring;Mobile computing;6LoWPAN;NEMO Mobility;Healthcare;Wireless Sensor Networks;Hand-off},   doi={10.1109/IMIS.2013.157},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Internet of things (IoT) becomes important and various used in many applications. In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application.

 title={SMEAD: A secured mobile enabled assisting device for diabetics monitoring}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Wearable health devices, mobile apps and diagnostic tools revolutionize the medical field by introducing new assisting devices for patients in a way to create comfort, communication and augmented intelligence. Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.},   keywords={artificial intelligence;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;social networking (online);diagnostic tools;augmented intelligence;sensor devices;gateway;evidence-based medicine system;SMEAD;end-to-end secured system;diabetic patients;medication;insulin dosage;cryptographic security;formalized data access;secured mobile enabled assisting device;wearable health devices;mobile apps;cloud-based platforms;Internet of Things;MEDIBOX;blockchain-based disruptive technology;smart contracts;social networks;diabetics monitoring;patient assisting devices;privacy;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diabetes;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security;Temperature sensors;Diabetics Monitoring;MEDIBOX;Blockchain;IOT;Mobile Phone},   doi={10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384099},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Privacy Preservation in e-Healthcare Environments: State of the Art and Future Directions}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={464-478},   abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity, and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end-to-end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks, to incorporating the Internet of Things, to communication links, and to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise are of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level toward the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision making regarding their protected health information/electronic health record. A lot of works and efforts are necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, and identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;medical information systems;data privacy;patient privacy;e-Healthcare systems;e-Healthcare enterprise;end-to-end privacy;healthcare services;Privacy;Medical services;Electronic mail;Wireless sensor networks;Access control;Data privacy;e-Healthcare;privacy;anonymity;access control},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767561},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing - in some cases, even eliminating - their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems).},   keywords={embedded systems;energy harvesting;Internet of Things;power aware computing;Internet of Things;societal-scale problems;ultralow power hardware platforms;wireless connectivity;intelligent system-level power management techniques;environmental energy harvesting;IoT devices;batteries;QUBE wireless embedded platform;nonvolatile memory technologies;Batteries;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Random access memory;Sensors;Power demand;Nonvolatile memory;Internet of Things;Low Power;Power Management;Energy Harvesting;Perpetual Systems;Wearable Computing},   doi={10.1145/2627369.2631644},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

At the core of this transformation lies "data". This transformation is facilitated by embedded devices, collectively known as Internet of Things (IoT), which produce real-time feeds of sensor data which are collected and processed to produce a dynamic physical model used for optimized real-time decision making. At the infrastructure level, there is a need to develop a scalable architecture for processing massive volumes of present and historical data at an unprecedented velocity to support the IoT paradigm. To cope with such extreme scale, we argue for the need to revisit the hardware and software co-design landscape in light of two key technological advancements. First is the virtualization of computation and storage over highly distributed data centers spanning across continents. Second is the emergence of a variety of specialized hardware accelerators that complement traditional general-purpose processors. Further efforts are required to unify these two trends in order to harness the power of big data. In this paper, we present a formulation and characterization of the hardware acceleration landscape geared towards real-time analytics in the cloud. Our goal is to assist both researchers and practitioners navigating the newly revived field of software and hardware co-design for building next generation distributed systems.

One promising solution, on-chip error correction coding (ECC), has gained traction among memory companies [1] and is now required by the LPDDR4 standard for the first time [2].

Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host. Within the proposed ETT, both the mobility model, as well as the detection thresholds are calculated solely based on sensory data, making the whole system both scalable and robust to dynamic changes.

Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out.

The platform consists of a self-contained smart cup that can be used to perform exercises that are similar to everyday tasks such as drinking. The first smart cup prototype, the design of which was based on interviews regarding the needs of therapists, contains various sensors that collect information about its orientation, the liquid level, its position compared to a reference target and tremors. The prototype also includes audio and visual displays that provide feedback to patients about their movements. Two studies were carried out in conjunction with healthcare professionals and patients. The first study focused on collecting feedback from healthcare professionals to assess the functionalities of the cup and to improve the prototype. Based on this paper, we designed an improved prototype and created a visualization tool for therapists. Finally, we carried out a preliminary study involving nine patients who had experienced an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in the previous 24 months. This preliminary study focused on assessing the usability and acceptability of the cup to the patients. The results showed that the cup was very well accepted by eight of the nine patients in monitoring their activity within a rehabilitation center or at home. Moreover, these eight patients had almost no concerns about the design of the cup and its usability.},   keywords={Monitoring;Sensors;Visualization;Task analysis;Biomedical monitoring;Prototypes;Tools;Stroke;monitoring;Internet of Things;home;rehabilitation},   doi={10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2853553},   ISSN={2168-2372},   month={},}

However, simply being a technology company does not exempt an IoT company from needing to comply with the legislation applicable to their operating region that safeguards personal information. This will result in security and privacy requirements for healthcare solutions. There are several mature frameworks that address these issues, but they have been developed within the context of organised hospitals and care providers, where there is the expertise, processing power, communications and electrical power to support highly robust security. However, for IoT solutions aimed at vulnerable people, either at home or within their local environment, there are significant additional constraints that must be overcome. These include technical (low processing capability, power constrained, intermittent communications) organisational (how to enrol and revoke users and devices, distribution of cryptographic keys) and user constraints (how does a patient with physical and/or mental challenges configure and update their devices). This paper considers at the legal frameworks and the security and privacy requirements for healthcare solutions.

The hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN) is a special kind of the generic IoT network, which is composed of the different nodes, such as the gateway node, cluster head nodes, and sensing nodes organized in a hierarchy. In HIoTN, there is a need, where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password, and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely accepted real-or-random model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. UAKMP offers several functionality features including offline sensing node registration, freely password and biometric update facility, user anonymity, and sensing node anonymity compared to other related existing schemes. In addition, UAKMP is also comparable in computation and communication costs as compared to other existing schemes.},   keywords={authorisation;biometrics (access control);computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;message authentication;secure user authenticated key management protocol;smart home;smart city;smart grid;industrial Internet;smart retail supply chain;smart supply chain;smart farming;hierarchical IoT network;HIoTN;gateway node;cluster head nodes;sensing nodes;generic IoT networking environment;three-factor remote user authentication scheme;UAKMP;user smart card;informal security;formal security verification;applications tool;offline sensing node registration;user anonymity;sensing node anonymity;Internet security protocols;generic Internet of Things;Sensors;Protocols;Authentication;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;Authentication;automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPAs) simulation;generic Internet of Things (IoT) network;hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN);key management;security},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780232},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={4},   pages={24-32},   abstract={With the evolution of the Internet of Things, mutual sharing of information becomes easy among various smart devices across the globe. In such an environment, smart healthcare also needs to be expedited with an aim to provide remote diagnosis to patients located across the globe. However, as the sensitive information about a patient travels using an open channel (i.e., the Internet), there are chances of misusing this information. Hence, there is a requirement for a strong crypto mechanism for securely processing smart healthcare data. Most of the solutions reported in the literature use heavy computation-based solutions for providing security to smart healthcare data, which may not be suitable in view of less resources for modern smart devices. In this article, we propose a novel lattice-based secure cryptosystem for smart healthcare (LSCSH) in future smart cities. LSCSH uses a lightweight key exchange and an authentication mechanism at several stages. The proposed scheme has been evaluated with respect to the communication and computation costs in comparison to the other competitive schemes.

Over the last four decades, the relentless pursuit of IC device miniaturization for manufacturing high-performance and high-density IC-chips and system-on-a-chip (SoC) led to the creation of Internet and social media. The semiconductor components are used in smart cars, smart homes, smart cities, smart health, smart energy, smart security, smart appliances, and so on. The Internet enables connecting any and every smart devices or “things” creating “Internet of Things” (IoT) or Internet of everything (IoE). And, the IoT-connected smart devices constitute a smart environment and integrated ecosystem that can be accessed via personal computers, tablets, and smartphones from anywhere without human interaction. However, the performance of nanoscale-MOSFETs in the design and manufacturing of “smart” electronic products necessary to create smart networks or “smart things” to enable smart environments and integrated ecosystems is inadequate due to the fundamental physical limitations such as short channel effects (SCEs). Shrinking conventional bulk MOSFET device dimensions in the decananometer regime degrades device performance including degradation in the subthreshold swing and decrease in device turn-on voltage. As a result, the scaled MOSFETs cannot be turned off easily by lowering the gate voltage leading to excessive leakage current. Due to SCEs, the device characteristics become increasingly sensitive to process variation that imposes a serious challenge for continued scaling of bulk-MOSFETs for the nanometer technology nodes. In addition, at gate length below 20-nm, the sub-surface leakage paths are weakly controlled by the gate irrespective of gate oxide thickness and their potential barriers can be easily lowered by drain bias through the enhanced electric field coupling to the drain. Thus, to surmount the continuous scaling challenges of conventional bulk MOSFET devices new device technologies such as FinFET has emerged as the real alternative to MOSFETs. This tutorial provides the basic features and operating principles of FinFETs required for the understanding of design and manufacturing of advanced ICs at the nanometer nodes for smart electronic products. In addition, this tutorial also discusses the emerging undoped or lightly-doped channel MOSFETs with performance comparable to FinFETs for design and manufacturing of smart IC products.},   keywords={MOSFET;Manufacturing;Logic gates;Integrated circuit modeling;Tutorials;Nanoscale devices},   doi={10.1109/SMELEC.2018.8481323},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Multiple techniques have been developed for quantitative gait analysis but comparatively these systematic process fails as it measures static or dynamic process for very short duration of time and space. In the proposed system, an electronic insole system is designed in a shoe using force sensing resistor (FSR) sensor that monitors pressure wirelessly, thus saving the information in an array of sensor network for transferring data into CPU. Thus considering the information available used for further study purpose. Four sensors are placed, one at the heel, one at the lateral part, one at the metatarsal head and one at the anterior. The plantar pressure is used to analyse pressure distribution. The signal from the pressure sensor will be processed by microcontroller and sent to mobile via Bluetooth module. With the help of Internet-of-Things (IoT), when the signal goes beyond the limit the notification will be sent to patient consulting the doctors/physiotherapist so that immediate action can be carried out further.

Then we propose a practical framework called PrivacyProtector, patient privacy protected data collection, with the objective of preventing these types of attacks. PrivacyProtector includes the ideas of secret sharing and share repairing (in case of data loss or compromise) for patients' data privacy. Since it is the first time, we apply the Slepian- Wolf-coding-based secret sharing (SW-SSS) in PrivacyProtector. In the framework, we use a distributed database consisting of multiple cloud servers, which ensures that the privacy of patients' personal data can remain protected as long as one of the servers remains uncompromised. We also present a patient access control scheme in which multiple cloud servers collaborate in shared construction to offer patients' data to healthcare providers without revealing the content of the data.

These systems typically help measure financial success through the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric. SCCEA represents a shift in approaches from these architectures to one focused on the interactions with the products customers own and on how those products are operating. SCCEA analyzes the data gathered directly from the operations of products to make a determination of what actions can be taken to positively influence customer experience. SCCEA is realized through combining three foundational domains: Smarter Commerce™, Internet of Things, and Customer Engagement. The paper begins with a definition of the commerce lifecycle, followed by an overview of the three foundational domains. With this foundation established, the authors describe the SCCEA architecture, subsystems, and functional components. Finally, to help clarify the feasibility of the SCCEA approach, a representative scenario from the healthcare industry is presented.},   keywords={Internet of things;Network architecture;Electronic commerce;Market research;Consumer behavior;Consumer products;Customer services;Investments},   doi={10.1147/JRD.2014.2346593},   ISSN={0018-8646},   month={Sept},}

 title={Enabling Dynamic and Lightweight Management of Distributed Bluetooth Low Energy Devices}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={620-624},   abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although recent versions of BLE embrace the 6LoWPAN standard for IPv6 low-power device communication, this is often not the best choice for constrained-node networks due to downsides such as increased memory and computation overhead, heavier network stack, increased power consumption, backward incompatibility, etc. A crucial requirement for successful IoT solutions is an efficient strategy for monitoring and control of highly distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight model for management of distributed constrained BLE nodes based on OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol. To this end, we have designed a new intermediate component, a BLE-LWM2M gateway (GW), which has dual roles: a BLE master that monitors and controls the BLE devices, and a LWM2M client that acts on behalf of an operator's LWM2M management server. The BLE-LWM2M GW has interfaces to dynamically manage connected BLE devices as LWM2M objects, called ObjectTwins, in runtime without a need for user configuration. All services that BLE devices provide are mapped to the ObjectTwins in the gateway, which are exposed to the LWM2M server. Hence, this model enables a LWM2M server to manage distributed BLE devices by interacting with the BLE-LWM2M GW using the LWM2M standard methods, and the constrained devices can still use a native Bluetooth communication protocol. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of a mobile healthcare system has been implemented in a testbed.},   keywords={Bluetooth;distributed sensors;Internet of Things;internetworking;personal area networks;protocols;wireless communication technology;IPv6 low-power device communication;constrained-node networks;computation overhead;distributed constrained BLE nodes;BLE master;LWM2M client;connected BLE devices;LWM2M objects;distributed BLE devices;LWM2M standard methods;constrained devices;native Bluetooth communication protocol;power consumption;distributed sensor nodes;dynamic management model;distributed Bluetooth low energy devices;lightweight management model;6LoWPAN standard;IoT solutions;OMA lightweight M2M protocol;BLE-LWM2M gateway;operator LWM2M management server;ObjectTwins;Servers;Bluetooth;Protocols;Monitoring;Logic gates;Internet;Wireless sensor networks},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390355},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

With the increase in patient population, remotely prioritizing and diagnosing patients becomes a major problem. Research has been conducted to address this issue. However, many models fail to support the condition of comorbidity. In this paper, we developed a multi-task machine learning model that supports remote patient prioritization based on disease severity. This model not only considers patients diagnosed with a single disease, but also acknowledges comorbidity of a patient to calculate their severity utilizing physiological data. Classifying a comorbid patient based on their disease(s) severity is a challenging task. We achieve this by exploiting the commonalities and differences between the diseases using multi-task machine learning. Based on the correlation between diseases, we classify the patient into appropriate severity level. In addition to this, our model also supports continuous patient monitoring based on their severity levels, which is made possible by implementing in Apache Spark. Apache Spark also serves as a real-time streaming processor suitable for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis.},   keywords={diseases;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;telemedicine;remote patient monitoring;patient population;comorbidity;remote patient prioritization;disease severity;multitask machine learning;appropriate severity level;continuous patient monitoring;severity levels;comorbid patient prioritization;Internet of Things;remote patient diagnosis;Apache Spark;real-time streaming processor;Body sensors;remote monitoring;remote diagnosis;multi-task learning;comorbidity;disease severity;patient prioritization;Apache Spark;continuous monitoring},   doi={10.1109/BigData.2017.8258392},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={342-349},   abstract={Data-driven business processes are gaining popularity among enterprises now-a-days. In many situations, multiple parties would share data towards a common goal if it were possible to simultaneously protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations described in the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics require parties to transfer their raw data to a trusted mediator, who then performs the desired analysis on the global data, and shares the results with the parties. Unfortunately, such a solution does not fit many applications where privacy is a strong concern such as healthcare, finance and the internet-of-things. Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy, in this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving multi-party analytics, where the goal is to enable analytics on multi-party data without compromising the data privacy of each individual party. We propose a secure gradient descent algorithm that enables analytics on data that is arbitrarily partitioned among multiple parties. The proposed algorithm is generic and applies to a wide class of machine learning problems. We demonstrate our solution for a popular use-case (i.e., regression), and evaluate the performance of the proposed secure solution in terms of accuracy, latency and communication cost. We also perform a scalability analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution as the data size and the number of parties increase.},   keywords={business data processing;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);trusted computing;privacy-preserving multiparty analytics;multiparty data;data privacy;individual party;data size;arbitrarily partitioned data;data-driven business processes;raw data;global data;enterprises;trusted mediator;internet-of-things;machine learning problems;secure gradient descent algorithm;Protocols;Cryptography;Data privacy;Organizations;Privacy;Machine learning algorithms;Hospitals;Multi-party Analytics;Privacy},   doi={10.1109/CLOUD.2017.51},   ISSN={2159-6190},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={362-369},   abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in communication technologies have enabled homes, cars even whole cities to be network connected. However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event.

 title={SmartCityWare: A Service-Oriented Middleware for Cloud and Fog Enabled Smart City Services}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={17576-17588},   abstract={Smart cities are becoming a reality. Various aspects of modern cities are being automated and integrated with information and communication technologies to achieve higher functionality, optimized resources utilization, and management, and improved quality of life for the residents. Smart cities rely heavily on utilizing various software, hardware, and communication technologies to improve the operations in areas, such as healthcare, transportation, energy, education, logistics, and many others, while reducing costs and resources consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT provides a platform for linking the cyber parts of a smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city, including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals, and other resources. Another useful technology is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable localized and real-time support for operating-enhanced smart city services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing is not an easy task. This paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing. We propose an SOM called SmartCityWare for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog Computing. SmartCityWare abstracts services and components involved in smart city applications as services accessible through the service-oriented model. This enhances integration and allows for flexible inclusion and utilization of the various services needed in a smart city application. In addition, we discuss the implementation and experimental issues of SmartCityWare and demonstrate its use through examples of smart city applications.},   keywords={cloud computing;middleware;smart cities;town and country planning;CoT;SOM approach;Cloud of Things;service-oriented middleware;optimized resource utilization;SmartCityWare;cloud computing paradigm;communication technologies;operating-enhanced smart city services;Fog Computing;Smart cities;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Smart city;Cloud of Things;Internet of Things;cyber physical systems;middleware;service-oriented middleware;cloud computing;fog computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731382},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2010},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Recently the problem of providing effective and appropriate healthcare to elderly and disable people is an important field in relative to the aging of population problems. The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},   keywords={cryptography;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet;mobile computing;patient care;protocols;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;healthcare;elderly people;disable people;information and communication technologies;ICT;clinical process;Internet of things;context awareness;patient life;6LoWPAN network;RFID technology;NFC technology;secure communications;cryptographic SIM card;authentication;MIPv6 protocol;sensor networks;mobility;Internet;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Communications technology;Radiofrequency identification;Information security;Medical services;Senior citizens;Aging;Environmental management},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421661},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks;wireless mesh routing protocol;DoS attacks;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;Internet of things;wireless mesh network;denial of service attacks;data packet delivery ratio;Routing protocols;Routing;Computer crime;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;eHealthcare;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;health care;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;patient monitoring;pattern matching;real-time systems;signal classification;telemedicine;Web services;personalized healthcare;wearable systems;real-time ECG Classification;wearable biomedical devices;potential health hazards;timely medical treatment;modern wearable health monitoring devices;real-time analyses;ECG readings;arrhythmia classification;ECG waveforms;ECG equipment;machine learning phase;unique feature extraction method;prediction models;neuralnet fitting models;k-NN Classification models;misclassification error value;wearable devices;3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit;tele health analytical server;prediction tasks;trained classification models;ECG abnormalities;abnormal ECG events;Electronic Health Record;health care;cure institutions;Electrocardiography;Heart;Real-time systems;Databases;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Feature extraction;ECG classification;Wearable IoT;preventive health-care;real-time ECG;arrhythmia detection;arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB;Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;FHIR},   doi={10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Advanced medical diagnostics will utilize biosensors for biological data acquisition. This paper introduces the forecasting of biosensors that have the potential to be used in POC and IoT applications. For this research three types of biosensors were selected. These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively. Bibliometrics with annual publication count did not appear to provide much value in forecasting the maturity growth of the three biosensors.},   keywords={biosensors;health care;information analysis;Internet of Things;patents;production engineering computing;technological forecasting;ubiquitous computing;biosensor technologies forecasting;medical IoT applications;bibliometrics;patent analysis;point-of-care diagnostics;ubiquitous smart phone;Fisher-Pry model;Technology management;Technological innovation;Biosensors;Internet;Technology forecasting;Bibliometrics;Medical diagnostic imaging},   doi={10.1109/PICMET.2016.7806585},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Existing IoT based platforms rarely achieve a successful heterogeneous life-logging data aggregation.

From its inception, GPS was viewed as a revolutionary technology that would enhance the positioning capability of US and allied military forces throughout the world. The DoD has continued to upgrade and improve all of the components of the system to keep pace with technology advances and the requirements of an ever-expanding user community. The GPS user community includes an increasing number of civil, scientific, and commercial applications, ranging from precision scanning to pinpointing disruptions in electric power distribution networks. However, this dual military and civil aspect of GPS has posed significant challenges for the US government and DoD policy makers. Since the inception of GPS, the DoD has been confronted with the need to balance a wide range of different and sometimes competing national security, civil, foreign policy, commercial and scientific interests. The challenge has been to exploit the full civil utility of the system without jeopoardizing national security interests in the process. This challenge will become even more formidable for military leaders as US and allied forces become increasingly reliant on GPS for all types of military operations, and as the applications of the worldwide civil user community continue to expand.},   keywords={Global Positioning System;radionavigation;radio direction-finding;military communication;DoD;global information resource;Navstar global positioning system;Department of Defense;USA;radio navigation;radio positioning;GPS;military forces;commercial applications;civil applications;scientific applications;precision scanning;electric power distribution networks;US government;national security;foreign policy;military operations;US Department of Defense;Information resources;Global Positioning System;Satellite broadcasting;Military satellites;Satellite navigation systems;Radio navigation;National security;Space technology;Government},   doi={10.1109/5.736339},   ISSN={0018-9219},   month={Jan},}

The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past.

 title={Secure Healthcare Data Dissemination Using Vehicle Relay Networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In the recent years, vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs) can be an attractive choice for collecting and transferring the healthcare data of the passengers to the remote healthcare centers. In VANETs, some of the intermediate nodes may act as relay nodes in which case, these networks are called as vehicular relay networks (VRNs). However, the transmitted information in VRNs can be captured by intruders during transmission. Moreover, an attacker can launch selective forwarding, blackhole and sinkhole attacks in the network, which may in turn degrade the network performance parameters like high end-to-end delay, low packet delivery ratio and network throughput. Hence, to address these issues, a secure data dissemination scheme using VRNs is proposed. In the proposed scheme, firstly, a secure vehicular medical relay network system is designed for the users belonging to disconnected rural areas. The collected information is filtered at zonal levels before transmission to a nearby road side units (RSUs), which further pass it to the incoming vehicles. Secondly, a secure passenger health monitoring network is designed which continuously monitors health services of the passengers traveling in different vehicles. The information collected through small body sensors installed in the vehicles act as data sets that is forwarded to the on-board monitoring unit within the vehicle. This collected data is then transmitted to centralized healthcare centers for processing by using VRNs. Lastly, a strong Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based cryptographic solution is designed for secure communication among different vehicles. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in various network scenarios with respect to different selected parameters, such as throughput, network delay, packet delivery ratio, jitter, transmission and computation overheads, and key distribution overhead. The obtained results indicate that the proposed scheme provides improvement of 52% in average delay and 5% in packet delivery ratio. This further indicates effective message delivery even with high mobility of the vehicles.},   keywords={Medical services;Data dissemination;Monitoring;Relay networks (telecommunications);Cryptography;Electronic mail;Vehicular relay network;Healthcare;Data dissemination;ECC;Body sensor networks;Security.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2865008},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32.

For example, a wearable system provides unobtrusive ambulatory, continuous, ubiquitous health measurement, and real-time solution for patients physical without hampering the natural movement of the wearer. However, the ability to measure one’s Automatic Nervous System (ANS) using wearable biosensors in healthcare applications has been limited due to several challenges related to a lack in wearability, accuracy, reliability and low-power consumption. In this paper, we presented a novel wearable ring sensor for the continuous measurement of four ANS activities: Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, skin temperature and locomotion. Detailed information is given regarding the development of the proposed ring sensor followed by a discussion of the evaluation that was done utilizing the wearable sensor on volunteers to gather data. Specifically, volunteers wore the ring sensor while being simultaneously monitored with real-time telemetry, the sensor values are processed and analyzed. This paper is a continuation and extension of earlier work by the authors. New validation, experimental results and development of the mobile application have been added to improve the previous system. The experiment demonstrated accurate results, and data were collected from 43 participants of diverse age, body mass, height, and race.

It helps to enable preventive care and promote automation to reduce the risk of human error. In Indonesia, mother and child health care is still an important agenda of the government because the maternal and child mortality rate is still high. This paper describes a preliminary design of IoT applications for supporting mother and child healthcare program. We reviewed government regulations and guidelines to determine the needs and used them as a starting point. Then we defined the networks (topology, architectures, and platform), service and application, security and technology used in the design. This multi-platform system design constitutes portable medical devices with multiple sensors for collecting medical data and sending them to server. A mobile application works as mobile gateway for the devices and as a portal for accessing context-aware personalized information related to patient's condition. It also works as communication tool for teleconsultation. All of these functionalities are supported by service applications in a cloud so that patients and caregivers can access them from anywhere at anytime. This system is designed to enable remote monitoring and early detection by medical specialist and physicians at the clinic for mother and child preventive care.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;telemedicine;mother;child health program;Indonesia;Internet of Things;human error;child health care;maternal child mortality rate;IoT applications;child healthcare program;government regulations;multiplatform system design;portable medical devices;mobile application works;child preventive care;Pediatrics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pregnancy;Weight measurement;Mobile communication;Security;Internet of Things;mother and child health care;mobile application;multi-platform;context-aware personalization},   doi={10.1109/BCWSP.2017.8272576},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Too often innovation is focus on the technical evolution and underestimated on the business field, however it is a key aspect for new technologies and services to reach commercial success. Traditional business models in the energy sector will suffer big changes in the next years, as the Smart Grid concept is developed. By the advent of new services and applications, horizontal and vertical partnerships with competitors and other actors will take place.

  year={2017},   volume={01},   number={},   pages={454-462},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly developing field and has the potential to significantly impact the healthcare industry. However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.},   keywords={analytic hierarchy process;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;multicriteria evaluation;Internet of Things;IoT;dementia care;chronic diseases;special needs;analytic hierarchy process;AHP;health care services;Dementia;Industries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Sensors;Internet of Things;e-Health;Dementia care;Assisted Living;Multicriteria evaluation},   doi={10.1109/CBI.2017.34},   ISSN={2378-1971},   month={July},}

The introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) and latest developments or improvements in E-health, pointed towards the fifth generation (5G) paradigm of health care application and services. This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data. Further, we propose a protocol stack for 5G-CCN WBAN to provide a secure, efficient and reliable E-health application services to meet the required needs of the current IP protocol stack and IoT devices.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;body area networks;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;IP networks;transport protocols;wireless medical sensor prototype;E-health care application record databases;unified communication framework;fifth generation network;fifth generation paradigm;Content-Centric networking based framework;wireless body area network;IP network;CCN router;5G-CCN WBAN;IP protocol stack;IoT devices;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Medical services;Servers;5G mobile communication;Wireless sensor networks;IP networks;Content-Centric Network;Wireless body area network;Caching;Healthcare;Internet-of-things},   doi={10.1109/ICIOTA.2017.8073614},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Bluetooth;data compression;electrocardiography;entropy codes;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;radio transceivers;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;hybrid data compression scheme;power reduction;IoT wireless sensors;data transmission scheme;Internet-of-Things;hybrid transmission mode;adaptive data rate selection;wireless transmission;electrocardiogram;ECG;lossy compression technique;compression ratio;decompressed lossy data;entropy coding;lossless compression;Bluetooth transceiver;lossless transmission;healthcare applications;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Electrocardiography;Propagation losses;Hybrid power systems;Data compression;Hybrid compression;internet-of-things;lossless;lossy;wearable devices;wireless sensors;Algorithms;Data Compression;Databases, Factual;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wireless Technology},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2591923},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={April},}

It is very fast growing innovative trends in the field of Internet of Thing (IOT). Context Awareness is key part of pervasive computing. Context aware computing it means act of both sensing data from sensor and react according to sensory data. Context is nothing but information about any entity. For representation of Context Awareness there is need of setting up context. For setting up or defining context there is need of different parameters. Based on that parameters context is defined. Proposed system is all about context aware middleware for Human Activity Recognition. The main idea of activity recognition is to recognize day to day common human activities in real life.

With the advent of modern technologies the need-gap may be augmented. Sensor is one such technology which can be used to enable Internet of Things based health-care monitoring system.

In a real time health monitoring system, there are many sensors connected to a local data processing unit through a shared channel having a fixed bandwidth. These sensors have a wide variety of channel access requirements. The access to the channel should be discrete, so that each and every sensor avails the required bandwidth and delay in the shared channel.

One critical IoT application pertains to m-Health services which allow monitoring the health status of patients while providing the ability for a rapid response in emergency cases. Connecting healthcare services to the IoT brings forward new security threats and vulnerabilities that can jeopardize the patients' private data. In this paper, a novel security framework for m-Health IoT security is proposed using the concept of moving target defense (MTD). MTD allows the m-Health system to dynamically change its cryptographic keys to increase uncertainty on an attacker and secure the data. In the proposed scheme, the devices update their keys locally to eliminate the risk of revealing new keys while they are being shared with a gateway. A practical implementation is proposed based on bitslicing LED, a lightweight encryption cipher, to improve the performance of decrypting multiple packets at the same time. LED bitsliced implementation was tested on an ARM Cortex-A53 and was shown to consume half of the processor's instructions compared to the conventional implementation. The effect of applying MTD on the number of processor's instructions is evaluated and shown to be bounded.},   keywords={cryptography;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Internet of Things;security threats;cybersecurity;m-Health IoT security;novel security framework;healthcare services;emergency cases;m-Health services;networked services;LED bitslice implementation;m-Health IoT systems;conventional implementation;LED bitsliced implementation;bitslicing;practical implementation;cryptographic keys;m-Health system;MTD;Encryption;Logic gates;Light emitting diodes;Performance evaluation;Internet},   doi={10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326298},   ISSN={2158-4001},   month={Jan},}

The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. This paper addresses some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a secure digital camera integrated with the secure better portable graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this paper is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection, concurrent encryption and watermarking, which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management. The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: 1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image and 2) frequency-domain watermarking using blockwise DCT of size 8 × 8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant increase of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of our knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.},   keywords={cryptography;data compression;data privacy;discrete cosine transforms;emergency services;health care;image coding;image watermarking;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;trustworthy media communications;traditional healthcare;smart bio-sensors;on-body sensors;smart hospitals;smart emergency response systems;smart city;smart technology;information technology;IoT infrastructure;smart healthcare framework;hardware architecture;secure digital camera;patient data protection;SBPG architecture;privacy;compression technique BPG;compression quality;compressed file size;watermarking;compression processes;BPG compression;image authentication capability;secure portable graphics compression algorithm;image quality;secure communication;Medical services;Watermarking;Digital cameras;Image coding;Computer architecture;Smart healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);consumer electronics;secure digital camera;image communications;better portable graphics},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795478},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Distributed Pricing Policy for Cloud-Assisted Body-to-Body Networks with Optimal QoS and Energy Considerations}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Cloud-Assisted Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is one of the key emerging technology for medical applications in the era of Internet-of-Things. In cloud-assisted WBANs, the WBANs are able to access the cloud resources, which are geographically close to the local Access Points (APs). However, in the presence of poor radio link-quality between cloud-assisted WBANs and APs, energy consumption and service delay of the network dynamically changed. In order to solve this problem, we propose an energy-efficient Body-to-Body (B2B) communications among coexisting WBANs to relay the information of the patients to APs to provide real-time healthcare services. On the other hand, the healthcare services enabled for cloud-assisted WBANs is popularly known as Healthcare-as-a-Service (He-aaS). In He-aaS, it is very challenging to finalize a price agreement between WBANs and H-CSPs as WBANs follow a heterogeneous architecture.

Product quality is influenced by temperature perturbations and time delays in interventions. Thanks to Internet of Things (IoT) considerable progress has been made in recent years in the improvement of temperature monitoring devices. However, temperature monitoring in medicine Cold Chain remains challenging. In this paper it is presented a conceptual model aiming at overcoming challenges of medicine Cold Chain related to temperature monitoring. The major particularity of our model is that it considers the complete Cold Chain according to two perspectives of pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in a single study. Besides this model can be applied also in vaccine Cold Chain and in temperature-controlled logistics of laboratory medicine. Our conceptual model supports the development of a smart Cold Chain system for temperature monitoring based on IoT.

In IoT based healthcare, diverse distributed devices aggregate, analyse and communicate real time medical information to the cloud, thus making it possible to collect, store and analyse the large amount of data in several new forms and activate context based alarms. This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system. This work explains the implementation of an IoT based In-hospital healthcare system using ZigBee mesh protocol.

This work develops the Alzimio mobile app, to provide safety functions to these patients; including safe-zone geofencing, activity-based alarms, take-me-home, navigate to nearest friend, and check-on-me. Six main design goals guided the design of Alzimio, including periodic safety checks, refined user control, flexibility and efficiency of alarms, and optimized operation, among others. Providing reliable continuous sensing and operation without drastically affecting battery lifetime provided a challenge. Such challenge is not unique to Alzimio, but is general to most IoT healthcare devices. Novel activity-recognition and geofencing algorithms are designed and optimized to meet the goals and overcome the challenge. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. Alzimio is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios.

Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.},   keywords={brain;cognition;diseases;embedded systems;injuries;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;sport;Web services;traumatic brain injury diagnosis;disability;athlete;head trauma;cognitive abilities;cognitive impairment;inexpensive diagnostic helmet;web-based application system;head injury;patient-tailored treatment plans;web application;Intel Edison IoT IDE;JavaScript;HTML;CSS;Node.js platform;Force;Brain injuries;Head;Sensors;Acceleration;Resistors;Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Intel Edison;Wireless computing;Patient care;Internet of Things;Application;SMS;Traumatic Brain Injury},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249087},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Smart cities heavily rely on utilizing a number of technologies to improve the performance and services in healthcare, transportation, energy, education, and many others, while reducing costs and resource consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT can provide a platform for linking the cyber parts of the smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals and other physical resources. Another technology that can be utilized for enhancing smart cities services is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable better support for operating enhanced services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing for smart cities is not an easy task. The paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing.

From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry.

As one of the most sophisticated IoE applications, real-time video analytics is promising to significantly improve public safety, business intelligence, and healthcare &amp; life science, among others. However, cloud-centric video analytics requires that all video data must be preloaded to a centralized cluster or the cloud, which suffers from high response latency and high cost of data transmission, given the scale of zettabytes of video data generated by IoE devices. Moreover, video data is rarely shared among multiple stakeholders due to various concerns, which restricts the practical deployment of video analytics that takes advantages of many data sources to make smart decisions. Furthermore, there is no efficient programming interface for developers and users to easily program and deploy IoE applications across geographically distributed computation resources. In this paper, we present a new computing framework,<i>Firework</i>, which facilitates distributed data processing and sharing for IoE applications via a virtual shared data view and service composition.

Smart devices can directly interact with the human beings for sensing the healthcare parameters and transmitting to a central repository. During the data exchange, it is mandatory to secure the messages between sender and receiver to handle the malicious human based attacks. For providing secure communication, a number of signature-based schemes are explored in literature but smart devices need more lightweight operations by ensuring desired security strengths. The main problem during signature based approaches is the computational overhead due to large real numbers required for signature and verification processes. This paper presents a light weight shortened complex digital signature algorithm for providing secure communication between smart devices in human centered IoT. We have used less extensive operations to achieve signature and verification processes like human beings do signatures on legal documents and verify later as per witness. We have also presented a multi-option parameter selection to use a signature-verification pair of expressions at particular index by adopting the common practice of human beings for using different signatures as per document criticality level. It enhances the security strength to guard against traffic analysis attacks. We have developed an experimental setup where a number of cell phones and smart devices are considered for secure communication using existing and proposed digital signature schemes. Results demonstrate the supremacy of our scheme as compared to preliminaries.},   keywords={computer network security;digital signatures;Internet;Internet of Things;telecommunication traffic;lightweight digital signature;security scheme;smart devices;data exchange;malicious human based attacks;secure communication;signature-based schemes;verification processes;complex digital signature algorithm;human-centered Internet of Things;IoT;healthcare parameters;central repository;multioption parameter selection;traffic analysis attacks;cell phones;Digital signatures;Smart devices;Internet of Things;Receivers;Public key;Medical services;Confidentiality;Complex numbers;Digital signatures;Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844406},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Since MC is directly inspired by communication processes in biological cells, the engineering of biological circuits through cells' genetic code manipulation, which enables access to the cells' information processing abilities, is a candidate technology for the future realization of MC components. In this paper, inspired by previous research on channel coding schemes for MC and biological circuits for cell communications, a joint encoder and modulator design is proposed for the transmission of cellular information through signaling molecules. In particular, the information encoding and modulation are based on a binary parity check scheme, and they are implemented by interconnecting biological circuit components based on gene expression and mass action reactions. Each component is mathematically modeled and tuned according to the desired output. The implementation of the biological circuit in a simulation environment is then presented along with the corresponding numerical results, which validate the proposed design by showing agreement with an ideal encoding and modulator scheme.},   keywords={binary codes;biocommunications;cellular biophysics;channel coding;genetic engineering;Internet of Things;modulation coding;molecular communication (telecommunication);parity check codes;biological circuit design;modulated parity-check encoding;molecular communication;Internet of Things;MC;biological cells;cell genetic code manipulation;channel coding schemes;cell communications;cellular information transmission;information encoding and modulation;binary parity check scheme;biological circuit component interconnection;gene expression;mass action reactions;Biological information theory;Proteins;Encoding;Cells (biology);Modulation;Chemicals;Gene expression;Molecular communication;biological circuit;parity-check encoding;Hill function;chemical reaction modeling;biochemical simulation},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2017.7997032},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1327-1336},   abstract={The rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds great promise to transform people's lives by making society more efficient in many areas, including energy, transportation, healthcare, commerce, manufacturing, etc. At their core, IoT devices use sensors to collect data on real-world physical processes and then transmit it over the Internet to cloud servers, which store, process, and learn from the data to better optimize these processes, either directly (by issuing remote commands that actuate IoT devices) or indirectly (by issuing notifications that direct users to take some action). Unfortunately, IoT devices also expose users to multiple new types of privacy attacks. In particular, the sensor data collected from IoT devices can indirectly reveal a variety of sensitive private information. In addition, users generally connect IoT devices to local networks, which they implicitly trust, with little understanding of what the IoT device is doing on the network. In this visionpaper, we discuss recent work on sensor data privacy in the context of smart energy systems to provide examples of i) the surprising types of private information we can glean from seemingly innocuous IoT data and ii) the different types of defenses we have developed to preserve IoT data privacy for smart energy systems. These defenses lie at different discrete points in the tradeoff between user privacy and IoT functionality, which motivates ongoing work on developing defenses that provide a more tunable tradeoff. We also discuss the privacy implications of connecting tens-to-hundreds of untrusted IoT devices to implicitly trusted local networks, and avenues for research to mitigate these concerns.},   keywords={cloud computing;data privacy;Internet;Internet of Things;untrusted IoT devices;IoT device;IoT data privacy;user privacy;IoT era;Internet-of-Things;cloud servers;privacy attacks;sensor data privacy;smart energy systems;Sensors;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Privacy;Privacy, Security, Internet of Things, Energy Systems, Smart Home, Smart Health},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00133},   ISSN={2575-8411},   month={July},}

In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code.

Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions. We have preliminarily implemented the OntoIoT framework and domain extension in selected scenarios of smart space and healthcare.

LoRaWAN, as a Long-Range Wide Area Network specification recommended by the LoRa Alliance, is a low power and long distance communication protocol suitable for IoT environments. This protocol adopts a widely used data encryption method, i.e., Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), developed based on powerful algebra operations and multiple encryption cycles to ensure its communication security. LoRaWAN reduces communication power by setting different transmission latencies for different end-devices; however, AES does not take into account its end device’s encryption power. In this paper, a high secure but low-power consumption communication scheme for the LoRaWAN, named the Secure Low Power Communication (SeLPC) method, is proposed to further reduce end-devices’ data encryption power by reducing encryption cycles of AES. In the SeLPC, encryption key and D-Box update procedure is presented to enhance security level and simplify the AES encryption process so that the power consumption can be further lowered. Comparing with the traditional AES, the analysis results show that the SeLPC can minimize the encryption power up to 26.2%. The SeLPC can also resist three attacks, including known-key, replay, and eavesdropping attacks and is practically helpful for use in LoRaWAN IoT environments.},   keywords={Encryption;Servers;Logic gates;Power demand;Network servers;Internet of Things;LoRaWAN;low power;data encryption;AES;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852563},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={351-356},   abstract={Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a wide concept to describe a group of diseases which affect a normal respiratory function and cause a considerable impact on patients' life quality and healthcare costs. There are few IoT systems in the present literature that are focused on monitoring and management of COPD patients, but they are not focused on the vast amount of data that IoT generates in a large scale deployment, and the integration of Smart City services. For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative system based on Cloud Computing and Big Data technologies to integrate Smart City services into a large scale scenario. To do so, this system proposes a Big Data architecture based on Apache Spark libraries to provide data integration, storage, descriptive and predictive analysis. Also, the system provides a web interface application where users can visualize the data analysis results. They show that the data enrichment function performed on the Big Data architecture provides more information about the environment to improve decisionmaking. This way, the system helps COPD patients to get more involved into decision making process and promote an active and healthy life by recommending the least polluted area to performance their daily activities.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;data integration;decision making;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;smart cities;COPD patients;Smart City services;innovative system;Big Data architecture;data enrichment function;IoT Data;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;normal respiratory function;data analysis;risk factors;patient monitoring;cloud computing;Monitoring;Smart cities;Big Data;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Sensors;Diseases;component;Internet of Things;Big Data;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;Smart City},   doi={10.1109/IC2E.2018.00060},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1716-1719},   abstract={Modern medical devices are equipped with radio communication chips enabling medical practitioners to remotely and continuously monitor patient's health. The conjunction of these medical devices with the radio communication chips and their internet connectivity exposes them to security and privacy risks. The insulin pump system is an autonomous, wearable external device, commonly used by diabetic patients to take insulin efficiently, as compared to manual injection through a syringe. Security attacks may disrupt the working of insulin pump system by delivering the lethal dose to patients and endanger their lives. In this paper, we ensure the correct dosing process of insulin pump system based on the combination of deep learning model and gestures performed by the patient. Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the thresh hold value of insulin based on last three months log of insulin pump system. If the amount of insulin to be injected by the insulin pump system is greater than our predicted thresh hold amount, then our system asks the patient to perform the gesture. After successful recognition of the patient's gesture, our solution compares the suspicious value of insulin with patient's gesture and identifies an attack.},   keywords={biomedical communication;biomedical equipment;biomedical telemetry;data privacy;diseases;gesture recognition;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient monitoring;patient treatment;recurrent neural nets;recurrent neural network;LSTM;long short-term memory;wearable external device;security attacks;medical devices;gesture recognition;deep learning;patient health monitoring;radio communication chips;insulin pump system;Insulin pumps;Insulin;Security;Recurrent neural networks;Machine learning;Sugar;Gesture recognition;Security;Deep Learning;Healthcare;Internet of Things;Network Attacks},   doi={10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00258},   ISSN={2324-9013},   month={Aug},}

IoT generates an unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud computing. But for realtime remote health monitoring applications, the delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient's real-time data at fog layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT-based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed Bayesian belief network classifier-based model has high accuracy and response time in determining the state of an event when compared with other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},   keywords={belief networks;data mining;decision making;health care;home computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;temporal health index;health data;smart home environment;real-time healthcare data;fog assisted-IoT enabled patient health monitoring;smart homes;mobile health;remote patient monitoring;cloud computing;realtime remote health monitoring applications;remote patient health monitoring;fog computing;smart gateway;embedded data mining;notification services;data transmission methodology;fog layer;temporal mining concept;Internet of Things technology;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Smart homes;Sensors;Medical services;Bayesian belief network (BBN);fog computing;Internet of Things (IoT);temporal health index (THI);temporal mining},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2803201},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources.

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;Parkinson's disease management;wearable technologies;Internet-of-Things;IoT;diagnostics;self-assessment;objective device-assessment;patient experience;disease progression;physical deficits;intelligent algorithms;tablets;cell phones;medical database;lightweight wearable sensors;real-time motion metrics;laterally distributed platform;chronic neurological disorders;life expectancy;global healthcare system;Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors;Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies;Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

IoT and smart cities are implemented in every field of life including home, offices, healthcare centers, agriculture, waste management, transport management and environmental monitoring to make them smart. There are many benefits of implementing IoT in real environment but it raises various issues and challenges including security, privacy and heterogeneous nature of objects. Further, there is not any common communication standard for this purpose. Many traditional approaches are proposed by researchers which do not address these issues completely in a real sense.

These, can be used to help address the individual fitness needs of the users and could be exploited within personalized healthcare plans. In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity. State of the art solutions are also compared with our approach.},   keywords={data compression;electrocardiography;encoding;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;signal denoising;lightweight lossy compression;biometric patterns;autoencoder denoising;wearable Internet of Things device;biosignal collection;energy constraint;internal memory space optimization;IoT devices;biometric signals;ECG traces;Training;Neurons;Principal component analysis;Artificial neural networks;Signal processing algorithms;Data models;Noise reduction;Autoencoders;biometric patterns;lossy compression;wearable devices},   doi={10.1109/LSP.2015.2476667},   ISSN={1070-9908},   month={Dec},}

Patients are facing a problematic situation of unforeseen demise due to the specific reason of heart problems and attack which is because of nonexistence of good medical maintenance to patients at the needed time. This is for specially monitoring the old age patients and informing doctors and loved ones. So we are proposing a innovative project to dodge such sudden death rates by using Patient Health Monitoring that uses sensor technology and uses internet to communicate to the loved ones in case of problems. This system uses Temperature and heartbeat sensor for tracking patients health. Both the sensors are connected to the Arduino-uno. To track the patient health micro-controller is in turn interfaced to a LcD display and wi-fi connection to send the data to the web-server(wireless sensing node). In case of any abrupt changes in patient heart-rate or body temperature alert is sent about the patient using IoT. This system also shows patients temperature and heartbeat tracked live data with timestamps over the Internetwork. Thus Patient health monitoring system based on IoT uses internet to effectively monitor patient health and helps the user monitoring their loved ones drom work and saves lives.},   keywords={Monitoring;Medical services;Temperature sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Temperature measurement;Insurance;Internet of Things;Healthcare;Services;Applications;Technologies;Architectures;Atmega},   doi={10.1109/ICACCE.2018.8441708},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Many organizations in the globe have surveys and announces emerging or disruptive technologies every year. Of course, they have developed their own processes to achieve the goal, but the insights of experts from related domains are usually absolute. In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results. We named this approach as Chi(Computer Human Interacting)-Delphi method for technology foresight. As Web goes to connect machine intelligences in the era of Internet of Things, the collaboration between human intelligence and machine intelligence will be eventually the next great wave for predicting the future.},   keywords={artificial intelligence;data mining;forecasting theory;groupware;health care;human computer interaction;inference mechanisms;Internet;security of data;collaboration;human expert;machine intelligence;science and technology;disruptive technologies;KISTI;data-intensive analysis;InSciTe;data gathering;text mining;identity resolution;reasoning;complex event processing;prescriptive analytics modules;intelligent service platform;Internet security;healthcare;NIPA;KISA;KRIBB;Chi-Delphi method;computer human interacting;Machine intelligence;Collaboration;Organizations;Floods;Text mining;Cognition;Internet},   doi={10.1109/KST.2016.7440470},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

Health is something in which its focus is more concentrated due to its hypnotic features. But it's still not implemented for the broad scope of Hospitals, and especially in Pakistan it's not being used for any purpose in health sector. So we need to define and provide IoT based hospital management information system (HMIS).

Especially the network security aspect of the IoT is of major importance due to huge amounts of data that the IoT is expected to generate and handle, and considering the limited resources of typical IoT devices. One of the serious security threats are the physical attacks on the IoT devices that operate in remote locations. These are known in the literature as the node capture attacks. Motivated by the aforementioned issues, this paper first introduces the background of IoT security and discusses the related challenges. Next, a secure group communication scheme that enables IoT using low energy wireless IP network is described. The proposed approach is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing scheme, which has been enhanced to enable secure group-to-group communication of resource-constrained IoT devices.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={6530-6539},   abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. Its process control is often referred to as embedded systems. Generally, CPS and Internet of Things have the same basic architecture, whereas the former shows a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements, i.e., wireless sensor networks can be a vital part of CPS applications. With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},   keywords={alarm systems;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;health care;medical computing;wireless sensor networks;medical cyber physical systems;process control;embedded systems;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;CPS applications;medical sensors;healthcare organization;Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter;healthcare environments;fuzzy logic;MFAFilter;fuzzy if-then rules;cyber-physical systems;false alarm reduction;Sensors;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks;Fuzzy logic;Industries;Computer science;Intrusion detection;False alarm reduction;fuzzy if-then rules;alarm filter;medical cyber-physical systems;wireless sensor networks;machine learning technique},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794685},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data.

We undertake test simulations (technology trial without patient subjects) to demonstrate potential of long-range analysis, using a disposable test `key' and companion Android app to form a diagnostic platform suitable for remote point-of-care screening for urinary tract infection (UTI). The 868 MHz LoRaWAN-enabled personalized monitor demonstrated sound potential with UTI test results being correctly diagnosed and transmitted to a remote secure cloud server in every case. Tests ranged over distances of 1.1-6.0 Km with radio path losses from 119-141 dB. All tests conducted were correctly and robustly received at the base station and relayed to the secure server for inspection. The UTI test strips were visually inspected for correct diagnosis based on color change and verified as 100% accurate. Results from testing across a number of regions indicate that such an Internet of Things medical solution is a robust and simple way to deliver next generation community-based smart diagnostics and disease management to best benefit patients and clinical staff alike. This significant step can be applied to any type of home or region, particularly those lacking suitable mobile signals, broadband connections, or even landlines. It brings subscription-free long-range biotelemetry to healthcare providers and offers savings on regular clinician home visits or frequent clinic visits by the chronically ill.

In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases. Overall, this study can usefully promote the development of healthcare-strategy design and implementation.},   keywords={diseases;electronic health records;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;patient care;pattern clustering;high-cost cluster;healthcare-strategy design;cluster analysis;flattened electronic medical records;health systems;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;patient clusters;health care;LOS difference;facility utilization;Diseases;Hypertension;Diabetes;Heart;Clustering algorithms;Electronic medical records},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.49},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The purpose of our protocol is to gain not only energy-efficiency but also provide low delivery latency when both periodic data and event-driven data are present. In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose standby slots that are deployed during each beacon interval. The standby slots are able to identify unscheduled data with low delivery latency. An adaptive beacon is then provided that quickly reschedules the time slots. Furthermore, the AB-MAC asymmetrically assigns energy consumption to a hub instead of the sensor nodes when possible in order to reduce node's energy waste. In this paper, we evaluate IEEE 802.15.4 and AB-MAC in energy consumption and delivery latency.

Market research company Gartner estimates that around 4.9 billion connected things will be in use in 2015, and around 25 billion by 2020. While there are substantial opportunities accompanying IoT, spanning from Healthcare to Energy, there are an equal number of concerns regarding the security and privacy of this plethora of ubiquitous devices. In this position paper we approach security and privacy in IoT from a different perspective to existing research, by considering the impact that IoT may have on the growing problem of insider threat within enterprises. Our specific aim is to explore the extent to which IoT may exacerbate the insider-threat challenge for organisations and overview the range of new and adapted attack vectors. Here, we focus especially on (personal) devices which insiders bring and use within their employer's enterprise. As a start to addressing these issues, we outline a broad research agenda to encourage further research in this area.},   keywords={data privacy;Internet of Things;mobile computing;security of data;insider threat;Internet-of-Things;IoT;data security;data privacy;ubiquitous device;attack vector;Security;Privacy;Sensors;Hardware;Data privacy;Feature extraction;Internet;Internet-of-things security; smart devices; wearables; insider threat; enterprise attack vectors; research agenda},   doi={10.1109/SIOT.2015.10},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

IoT embraces a wide set of heterogeneous services in highly impacting societal sectors, such as Healthcare, Smart Transportation or Media delivery, all of them posing a diverse set of requirements, including real time response, low latency, or high capacity. In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics. To that end, in this paper, we introduce and formulate the QoS-aware service allocation problem for CFC architectures as an integer optimization problem, whose solution minimizes the latency experienced by the services while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the capacity requirements.},   keywords={cloud computing;integer programming;Internet of Things;minimisation;quality of service;latency minimization;integer optimization problem;QoS-aware service allocation problem;CFC architecture;heterogeneous services;IoT;Internet of Things;end-user device;combined fog-cloud scenario;handling service allocation;Resource management;Cloud computing;Delays;Internet of things;Mathematical model;Computer architecture;Topology;Internet of Things;Combined Fog-Cloud;IoT Service Allocation},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2016.7511465},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community.

Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system.

Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.},   keywords={health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;healthcare;patient confidence;HealthSense;peer to peer database;blockchain-Internet of Things model;bio-sensor;patient medical status;smart contract;inter planetary file system;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Contracts;Internet of Things;Biological system modeling;Conferences;BlockchInternet of Things;InterPlanetary File System;MQTT;Representational State Transfer},   doi={10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389459},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={216-220},   abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},   keywords={assisted living;body sensor networks;cloud computing;gait analysis;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sensor fusion;multisensor IoT;assistive device;discrete gait monitoring;deployable gait monitoring;global healthcare system;chronic disease;wearable devices;particular impairments;mobility impairments;walkers;assistive technologies;unobtrusive activity monitoring;mobile device;multisensor fusion algorithm;health monitoring;gait cycles;hybrid sensorized canes;cloud storage;Monitoring;Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Instruments;Stability analysis;Aging;Sociology},   doi={10.1109/HIC.2017.8227623},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

In the modern world where the quality of living has been degraded significantly IoT can certainly play a constructive role in providing better services. In healthcare, there are several occasions such as patient health monitoring, remote observation and emergency proceedings outside the hospital where sensors can play essential roles. The coordinated sensor networks can provide even better services. IoT has the ability to provide all these coordinated services. Narrowband IoT (NBIoT) is an economical and simpler version of IoT which can handle these tasks effectively.

In this study, such an intelligent, unobtrusive conformable, user friendly physiological monitoring device is presented. In particular, the inkjet printing of silver nano-particle ink, NPS-JL from Harima Chemicals, is used to fabricate interconnections and a 2.4 GHz antenna on low-cost stretchable plastics. Interconnections between RF SoC and passive components are made with isotropic conductive adhesive.

Systems that offer AAL technologies make extensive use of personal data in order to provide services that are context-aware and personalized. This makes privacy preservation a very important issue especially since the users are not always aware of the privacy risks they could face. A lot of progress has been made in the deep learning field, however, there has been lack of research on privacy preservation of sensitive personal data with the use of deep learning. In this paper we focus on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder, which is a principal component of deep learning, and propose a new encoding technique that allows the creation of different AAL data views, depending on the access level of the end user and the information they require access to. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated with experiments on a simulated AAL dataset. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns privacy operations such as disclosure, deletion and generalization and can perform encoding and decoding of the data with almost perfect recovery.},   keywords={Privacy;Machine learning;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Decoding;Assisted living},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480247},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

This paper describes an IoT-based approach to the management intervention of type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is a major chronic disease with significant economic and social impact worldwide. Specifically, we focus on the structure, functionality, and development process of MyDay, which is an IoT-based, multi-faceted self-management problem solving tool for pediatric T1D patients. By leveraging IoT technologies, MyDay can connect with various devices to integrate traditionally paper-documented physiological data (e.g., blood glucose values) in real-time with psychosocial and contextual data, such as mood, stress, and social activities. By integrating relevant-but heterogeneous-data sources, MyDay can create personalized feedback for self-awareness of factors associated with diabetes self-management patterns and promote data sharing and problem solving. Iterative user-centered design cycles were used throughout the development of MyDay to document and/or troubleshoot feasibility and technical stability, optimize feedback for effective health communication through data visualization, identify barriers to app use, optimize assessment, and evaluate capability of the app as a problem solving tool. Each iterative design round identified technical and design issues that were addressed in subsequent rounds by incorporating user input and expertise. An in-vivo case study and one-month pilot study of the system indicated high feasibility and use of our IoT-based MyDay tool.},   keywords={blood;data visualisation;diseases;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical information systems;patient monitoring;patient treatment;user centred design;smart health opportunities;remote monitoring;health statistics;chronic conditions;IoT-based approach;management intervention;type 1 diabetes;chronic disease;social impact;functionality;development process;multifaceted self-management problem;pediatric T1D patients;IoT technologies;traditionally paper-documented physiological data;blood glucose values;psychosocial data;contextual data;social activities;diabetes self-management patterns;iterative user-centered design cycles;data visualization;problem solving tool;iterative design;identified technical design issues;IoT-based MyDay tool;self-management tool;precision behavioral medicine;heterogeneous-data sources;Internet of Things technologies;health communication;economic impact;Diabetes;Sugar;Problem-solving;Monitoring;Diseases;Blood;Type 1 diabetes, ecological momentary assessment, user-centered, iterative design, feedback, data visualization, mHealth, IoT in healthcare},   doi={10.1109/ICHI.2018.00015},   ISSN={2575-2634},   month={June},}

Nanotechnology is providing a new set of tools to design and manufacture miniaturized devices such as sensors or on/off chips networks. Such devices require wireless communications for information sharing and coordination. Unfortunately, reducing the size of a classical metallic antenna down to a few micrometres would impose the use of very high resonant frequencies, from the near infrared to the optical ranges (tens of hundreds of THz). This would drastically limit their communication range and require the implementation of transceivers able to operate at this extremely high frequency. Graphene offers a new approach to radically downscale antennas thanks to its ability to support the propagation of Surface-Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in the terahertz frequency band. Graphene micro-antennas provide a better integrability for future miniaturized wireless systems and represents an enabling technology for applications such as Wireless NanoSensor Networks, Internet of Things and On/Off-Chip Wireless Networks.

At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality.

 title={PRE-Fog: IoT trace based probabilistic resource estimation at Fog}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={12-17},   abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time responses. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data has to be uploaded to the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, the cloud on the edge of the network, known as Fog or Micro Datacenter (MDC), plays an important role. Fog resides between the underlying Internet of Things (IoTs) and the mega datacenter cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. To achieve this, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we propose in this paper. Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can stop using resources at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management through Fog computing, we take into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. With the intent of showing practical implications of our method, we implemented it on Crawdad real trace and Amazon EC2 pricing. Based on various services, differentiated through Amazon's price plans and historical record of Cloud Service Customers (CSCs), the model determines the amount of resources to be allocated. More loyal CSCs get better services, while for the contrary case, the provider reserves resources cautiously.},   keywords={cloud computing;probability;ubiquitous computing;pre-fog;IoT trace based probabilistic resource estimation;ubiquitous computing services;pervasive computing services;micro datacenter;Internet of Things;mega datacenter cloud;resource estimation;fog computing;resource management;relinquish probability;cloud service customers;CSC;Cloud computing;Resource management;Sensors;Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Computational modeling;Conferences;IoT;Cloud of Things;Fog computing;Edge computing;Micro Datacenter (MDC);resource management},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444724},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

Many systems have their own company-or industry-specific standards and protocols. So, a growing need for remote monitoring of such technology systems to provide users fault detections, anomaly warnings and classification of load for predictive maintenance does exist. To this aim, a low-cost supervising system based on single board computers Raspberry pi 3 has been implemented and reported in the paper. These connect the main components of the various technology systems to a server PC, thus implementing a distributed supervising system. The system has the main aim of an early collection of faults or alarm signals from the control panel of the various technology systems for both medical and building technology. The distributed Raspberry pi 3 computers communicate over the internet through a customized app installed on Android mobile.},   keywords={Hospitals;Monitoring;Uninterruptible power systems;Buildings;Relays;Fires;Temperature sensors;Healthcare technical systems;Supervising system;Rapsberry pi 3;IoT},   doi={10.1109/EEEIC.2018.8494473},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={United nation population report predicts that the world population will hit 8 billion by 2026 with hopping 1.5 billion in India. This increased population demands improved medical facilities only to realize there are not adequate doctors on role leading to deaths of nearly 1M Indians every year &amp; approximately 700M deprived of even preliminary health treatment thereby carrying 21% of the global disease burden. In general, doctors are either not willing to serve the rural areas or they are not available 24×7 that is causing rural population to travel to cities even for casual ailments. According to WHO (World Health Organization) reports, India have less than 0.7 doctor /1000 population which is lower as compared to ratio of 4.3 in Russian federation, 3.8 in Argentina, 2.4 in USA &amp; WHO Benchmark. Indian government spends just around 30% of the total budget in healthcare which is a penny in comparison to the USA &amp; the UK. This increased population demands lower operational cost with high accuracy, early detection followed by prevention. In this paper, a futuristic approach is proposed to support the existing healthcare system by designing a preliminary multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair with E-diagnostic feature within a medical booth, analogous to an ATM booth. The attractive part of our system is low priced diagnosis, non-invasiveness, indigenously built medical apparatus, misdiagnosis prevention with fast systematic approach.},   keywords={diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;telemedicine;multipurpose-health parameter monitoring chair;medical booth;healthcare support;E-diagnostic system;India;medical facilities;rural areas;rural population;casual ailments;World Health Organization;healthcare system;medical apparatus;global disease;IOT based approach;misdiagnosis prevention;Medical services;Sociology;Statistics;Monitoring;Magnetic sensors;Electrocardiography;Population report;ECG;Healthcare;NHP;BP;Heart rate;Doctor;Business model},   doi={10.1109/ICECCT.2017.8117810},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={826-834},   abstract={There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented.

One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={30-35},   abstract={In an environment that is only now addressing the security issues of medical devices as a constituent part of IT networks, a new wave of technological development is threatening to swamp healthcare. The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery. Making security the enabler of safe and protected data transfer, exchange, and use, is fundamental to using this technology.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;open systems;security of data;healthcare Internet of Things;security issues;medical devices;IT networks;HIoT;embedded sensing capabilities;security threats;data transfer frameworks;interoperability;healthcare setting;storage capabilities;healthcare providers;healthcare delivery;protected data transfer;Medical informatics;medical devices;data security;computer security;information science;privacy},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845455},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Communication Protocol for Enabling Continuous Monitoring of Elderly People through Near Field Communications}, 
  year={2014},   volume={26},   number={2},   pages={145-168},   abstract={Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the users and the system, are demonstrated.},   keywords={systems and tools for interaction design;usability testing;novel interaction paradigms;ubiquitous and mobile devices;ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools;assistive technologies},   doi={10.1093/iwc/iwt030},   ISSN={0953-5438},   month={March},}

Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements. We conclude the paper with a list of insights into what capabilities constrained WIoT platforms should provide developers so as to make the inclusion of data-driven security primitives in such systems.},   keywords={Internet of Things;security of data;data-driven security solutions;resource-constrained wearable IoT systems;wearable Internet-of-Things;WIoT environments;sensor-hijacking attacks;Amulet platform;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Biomedical monitoring;Base stations;Security;Training;Batteries;Wearable IoT;Data-driven security solution;Resource constrained},   doi={10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.15},   ISSN={2332-5666},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) represents the low-power, low-cost extension of the Bluetooth communication technology envisioned for the Internet of Things. Mesh protocols on top of BLE are currently emerging and the standard is currently being released. This paper first proposes a detailed measurement based comparison of two mesh approaches that fit within BLE operation: flooding and connection oriented networking. Using metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and power consumption we conclude that the optimal mesh approach depends on the application. It is shown that for a comparable performance in terms of PDR and overhead, flooding can trade a lower end-to-end delay for a higher power consumption when compared to the connected mesh. We then propose an architecture, called Bluetooth Now, that is able to automatically switch the network between the two based on message priority. Our measurement results confirm the reliable delivery of important and urgent data sent using the Bluetooth Now paradigm, while saving battery life when transmitting non-time critical messages.},   keywords={Bluetooth;routing protocols;connection oriented network;Bluetooth Low Energy;Bluetooth communication technology;Internet of Things;mesh protocols;BLE operation;connection oriented networking;packet delivery ratio;PDR;optimal mesh approach;Protocols;Bluetooth;Routing;Delays;Power demand;Switches},   doi={10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292705},   ISSN={2166-9589},   month={Oct},}

Various healthcare companies now provide remote healthcare services. Healthcare professionals are also adapting remote healthcare monitoring practices so as to monitor patients who are either hospitalized or executing their normal lifestyle activities at remote locations. Wearable devices available in the market calculate different health parameters and corresponding applications pass the information to server through their proprietary platforms. However, these devices or applications cannot directly communicate or share the data.

Starting from the overall scenario of this service, the paper proposes an HM oriented Sensing Service scenario (HM-SS) with the aim to improve the service quality and accessibility, considering the increasing interest for this service which comes not only from large medical facilities but also from small ones (clinics, general practitioners) where the outpatient setting is specific.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={105-110},   abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer centres;Internet of Things;mobile computing;probability;resource allocation;dynamic resource provisioning;Fog microdatacenter;ubiquitous computing services;pervasive computing services;research community;real-time response;cloud computing;Fog computing;IoT;data filtration;data preprocessing;security measures;resource management framework;mobile nodes;resource utilization;service type;service price;Java;CloudSim toolkit;service provider;Resource management;Cloud computing;Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Conferences;Logic gates;IoT;Cloud of Things;Fog computing;Edge Computing;Micro Data Center (MDC);resource management;Fog-Smart Gateway (FSG)},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134002},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={96-101},   abstract={In-home IoT devices play a major role in healthcare systems as smart personal assistants. They usually come with a voice-enabled feature to add an extra level of usability and convenience to elderly, disabled people, and patients. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},   keywords={cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition;privacy-preserving voice-based search;mHealth data;in-home IoT devices;healthcare systems;smart personal assistants;voice-enabled feature;elderly;disabled people;patients;in-home healthcare applications;voice recording;voice upload;voice content;mood;tone;background sound;voice data privacy;speech recognition;homomorphic encryption;encrypted voice data;caregiver queries;voice feature similarity;Servers;Databases;Encryption;Data privacy;Medical services;Speech recognition},   doi={10.1109/CHASE.2017.66},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

 title={A Fog Based Middleware for Automated Compliance With OECD Privacy Principles in Internet of Healthcare Things}, 
  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={8418-8441},   abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;middleware;distributed data collection protocol;IoHT devices;intensive privacy preserving processes;privacy regulation frameworks;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;concealment process;holistic privacy middleware;personal gateways;sensitive health information;cloud-based healthcare services;accountability act;health insurance portability;personal health information;privacy laws;healthcare data;healthcare provider;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;living organism;healthcare Web services;hospital setting;personalized health insights;health data;healthcare delivery;Internet of Healthcare Things;healthcare things;OECD privacy principles;automated compliance;fog based middleware;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data privacy;Data models;Logic gates;Privacy;Internet of things;Patient monitoring;Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, it still faces many severe challenges on the privacy of users&amp;#x2019; health information and the accuracy of diagnosis result, which deter the wide adoption of online medical primary diagnosis system. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online medical primary diagnosis framework (CINEMA). Within CINEMA framework, users can access online medical primary diagnosing service accurately without divulging their medical data. Specifically, based on fast secure permutation and comparison technique, the encrypted user&amp;#x2019;s query is directly operated at the service provider without decryption, and the diagnosis result can only be decrypted by the user, meanwhile, the diagnosis model in service provider can also be protected. Through extensive analysis, we show that CINEMA can ensure that user&amp;#x2019;s health information and healthcare service provider&amp;#x2019;s diagnosis model are kept confidential, and has significantly reduce computation and communication overhead.

For the specific case of hospital environments, NEMO provides continued connectivity with the Internet for patients attached with 6LoWPAN mobile nodes (MNs) regardless of patients' locations. NEMO comprises a set of mobile network nodes (MNNs) that could move together as a single unit, and each of these mobile networks has a mobile router (MR) that can change its attachment point to the Internet as the network moves together. Even though NEMO has a low signaling cost, but there is a need to understand their challenges for a 6LoWPAN mobile network in smart buildings. If the MR loses its energy, the connectivity with the network will be lost.

Internet of Things (IoT) play a major role in the infrastructure of a smart city by gathering and processing data from distributed sensors to implement smart services, such as traffic control, environment monitoring, and waste management. However, the most challenging part is securing data from various attacks while maintaining low-complexity techniques and algorithms. Considering security concerns to the deployment of IoT as the main source of data collection and transmission, attacks are classified to identify a suitable scheme of defending against them. This paper provides a two-fold contribution to analyze security and privacy in the context of smart cities for healthcare applications. Thus, on one hand an overview of different IoT applications and their cyber vulnerabilities are presented. On the other hand, a comprehensive evaluation of possible approaches to mitigate the problem of cyber attacks is described.},   keywords={Sensors;Medical services;Security;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Smart cities;Real-time systems;healthcare monitoring;Internet of things;smart cities},   doi={10.1109/W-FiCloud.2018.00028},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={61-66},   abstract={We present an approach that combines semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool to enable the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users. In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning. Possible applications of the presented system include the configuration of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},   keywords={application program interfaces;fault tolerance;home computing;inference mechanisms;meta data;visual programming;smart environment;visual modeling;semantic metadata;reasoning;goal-driven configuration;process-driven systems;service mashups;embedded semantic API descriptions;dynamic environments;fault-tolerant;visual programming tool;smart homes;Semantics;Cognition;Mashups;Thermostats;Internet of things;Context;Visualization},   doi={10.1109/IOT.2014.7030116},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={A Forensic Investigation of the Robot Operating System}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={851-857},   abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a framework that is mostly used in industrial applications such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing and it is not immune from potential future hacking. By carrying out various types of cyber-attacks, hackers can disrupt the normal operation of a robot. It is easy to get control of communication between a robot and a human due to the open communication network after carrying out malicious attacks to jam the network. As a result, hackers can change commands which are sent by an operator to the robot, making usual activities impossible. For instance, in a case of ROS hacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojans, backdoor attacks, and so on, can change the behaviour of robots to something completely different than expected.Therefore, forensic analysts require a specific method to forensically investigate ROS. This is a new area in the computer forensics field. Therefore, it is proposed to create an analytical framework to facilitate the forensic investigation of the Robot Operating System and methodologies and standards for acquiring related digital evidence using forensic tools. This study addresses a formalized and structured methodology that would assist the forensic investigation approach.This research will help to enhance the gathering, identification and preservation of evidence related to forensics investigations of the Robot Operating System.

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={4621-4635},   abstract={Recently, big data analytics has received important attention in a variety of application domains including business, finance, space science, healthcare, telecommunication and Internet of Things (IoT). Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.},   keywords={cloud computing;data analysis;Internet of Things;collaborative edge;cloud processing;wireless IoT networks;big data analytics;Internet of Things;IoT;data-aware intelligence;cloud computing;edge computing;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;Data analysis;Big Data;Wireless sensor networks;Edge computing;Distributed databases;Big data;data analytics;internet of things (IoT);cloud computing;edge computing;fog computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2682640},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Because IoT devices are closely related to the human life, they generally handle critical data which must be protected from a malicious adversary. However, a majority of IoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of memory and computational ability, so that they cannot provide heavy security protocols and authentication. To protect connections over constrained networks, we introduce a back-end offload architecture which offloads the processing of a security protocol to a specified back-end offloader. The offloader assists constrained devices back-end by handling the packets of handshake procedure and encrypted application data. The load balancing of offloaders and the protection of offload messages are also provided in the design. The proposed architecture allows an extremely constrained device to establish a secure session by utilizing high-level authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate, without the burden of deploying heavy security modules. This research would be advantageous for incompetent nodes to support security and reduce cost at the same time.},   keywords={cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;IP networks;personal area networks;public key cryptography;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;security modules;public key infrastructure;high-level authentications;offload messages;load balancing;encrypted application data;handshake procedure;security protocols;IoT devices;message exchange;IP-enabled 6LoWPAN;low-power wireless personal area networks;IPv6;IoT technologies;Internet of Things;resource-constrained networks;back-end offload architecture},   doi={10.1109/NCA.2016.7778645},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

A wide variety of industry sectors, including manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, transportation, and healthcare are actively seeking to incorporate IoT technologies in their operations. The increased connectivity and data sharing that give IoT systems their advantages also increase their vulnerability to attack. In this study, the authors explore the automated generation of attacks using genetic programming (GP), so that defences can be tested objectively in advance of deployment. In the authors' system, the GP-generated attackers targeted publish-subscribe communications within a wireless sensor networks that was protected by an artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS) taken from the literature. The GP attackers successfully suppressed more legitimate messages than the hand-coded attack used originally to test the IDS, whilst reducing the likelihood of detection. Based on the results, it was possible to reconfigure the IDS to improve its performance. Whilst the experiments were focussed on establishing a proof-of-principle rather than a turnkey solution, they indicate that GP-generated attackers have the potential to improve the protection of systems with large attack surfaces, in a way that is complementary to traditional testing and certification.},   keywords={genetic algorithms;Internet of Things;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor network;genetic programming;Internet of Things;IoT technology;artificial immune intrusion detection system;artificial immune IDS},   doi={10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090},   ISSN={2043-6386},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={124-130},   abstract={With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated &amp; intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting.

  year={2016},   volume={3},   number={6},   pages={1319-1333},   abstract={Routing plays an important role in the overall architecture of the Internet of Things. IETF has standardized the RPL routing protocol to provide the interoperability for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). LLNs cover a wide scope of applications, such as building automation, industrial control, healthcare, and so on. LLNs applications require reliable and energy-efficient routing support. Point-to-point (P2P) communication is a fundamental requirement of many LLNs applications. However, traditional routing protocols usually propagate throughout the whole network to discover a reliable P2P route, which requires large amount energy consumption. Again, it is challenging to achieve both reliability and energy-efficiency simultaneously, especially for LLNs. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient region-based routing protocol (ER-RPL), which achieves energy-efficient data delivery without compromising reliability. In contrast of traditional routing protocols where all nodes are required for route discovery, the proposed scheme only requires a subset of nodes to do the job, which is the key of energy saving. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies demonstrate that ER-RPL has a great performance superiority over two conventional benchmark protocols, i.e., RPL and P2P-RPL.},   keywords={computer network reliability;energy conservation;energy consumption;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;open systems;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;energy-efficient region-based RPL routing protocol;low-power and lossy network;Internet of Things;IETF;interoperability;LLN;point-to-point communication;P2P communication;energy consumption;energy-efficient data delivery;route discovery;energy saving;ER-RPL;machine-to-machine communication;Routing protocols;Reliability;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Internet of things;Energy-efficiency;low-power and lossy networks (LLNs);point-to-point (P2P) communication;region-based;reliability;routing protocol (RPL)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2016.2593438},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

These applications boost the opportunity for ubiquitous real-time monitoring using different data types such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG), etc. However, many remote monitoring applications require continuous sensing for different signals and vital signs, which result in generating large volumes of real time data that requires to be processed, recorded, and transmitted. Thus, designing efficient transceivers is crucial to reduce transmission delay and energy through leveraging data reduction techniques. In this context, we propose an efficient data-specific transceiver design that leverages the inherent characteristics of the generated data at the physical layer to reduce transmitted data size without significant overheads. The goal is to adaptively reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted in order to efficiently communicate and possibly store information, while maintaining the required application Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Our results show the excellent performance of the proposed design in terms of data reduction gain, signal distortion, low complexity, and the advantages that it exhibits with respect to state-of-the-art techniques since we could obtain about 50% compression ratio at 0% distortion and sample error rate.},   keywords={Transceivers;Electroencephalography;Electrocardiography;Medical services;Physical layer;Internet of Things;Wireless communication;EEG signal;mobile-Health system;data compression;OFDM transceiver;signal decomposition.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2832463},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},   keywords={3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;3G-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;WiFi-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;ubiquitous real-time monitoring;data logging;sensor nodes;temperature data;ECG signals;Internet-of-Things functionality;serial-line-Internet-protocol;UbuntuOne;remote U-healthcare monitoring;3G connectivity;4G connectivity;Electrocardiography;Temperature sensors;Medical services;Servers;Clouds;Real-time systems;Internet},   doi={10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783258},   ISSN={1558-2531},   month={Feb},}

Furthermore, both trust and doctor-patient relationship have also a positive effect on cues to action to use behavior.

The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth.

E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients, and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure three-factor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card; 2) password; and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient.

These smart devices are gradually transforming the IoT scenario into a new paradigm called cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT). We believe that CIoT will revolutionize many service sectors including smart cities, transportation, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. The current development in CIoT is still elusive as it has to achieve effective interoperability and autonomous decision making. Most importantly, the decision theoretic models are seen as an enabler to achieve effective interoperability among heterogeneous CIoT objects.

In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.},   keywords={application program interfaces;content-based retrieval;Internet of Things;middleware;optimisation;Web services;COSS;IoT service;Internet-Of-Things;environment monitoring;supply chain tracing;healthcare;vehicle networks;content-based subscription system;traffic monitoring;content-based subscription service;REST API;balanced rule engine partitioning;tenant-message-rule model;TMR model;NP-hard problem;message distribution;middleware;Web service;Engines;Servers;Throughput;Tunneling magnetoresistance;Filtering;Temperature sensors;Web service;IoT data management;content-based subscription;scalability},   doi={10.1109/ICWS.2015.56},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Wearable sensor devices attached to the patient can offer valuable supplemental information to healthcare professionals during treatment or therapy. In physical rehabilitation, wearable inertial sensor devices help therapists to monitor and evaluate parameters and key performance indicators of the rehabilitation activities. Therapy efficiency can be increased by using real-time feedback systems. Three different feedback system architectures are defined and studied: therapist, user, and cloud system. A case study involving rehabilitation therapy based on swimming exercises was performed. Field test results show that the developed sensor device and real-time therapist feedback application provide sufficiently accurate and precise data for the efficient evaluation of swimming parameters, such as stroke time and stroke rotation angle symmetry.

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={581-588},   abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;end-to-end security;healthcare Internet-of-Things;IoT;smart gateways;DTLS session resumption technique;remote end-users;security context;session resumption technique;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;energy performance evaluations;remote patient monitoring prototype;Conferences;Computers;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing},   doi={10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={863-870},   abstract={The advances in sensor technology over recent years has provided new ways for researchers to monitor the elderly in uncontrolled environments. Sensors have become smaller, cheaper and can be worn on the body, potentially creating a network of sensors. Smart phones are also more common in the average household and can also provide some behavioural analysis due to the built in sensors. As a result of this, researchers are able to monitor behaviours in a more natural setting, which can lead to more useful data. This is important for those that may be suffering from mental illness as it allows for continuous, non-invasive monitoring in order to diagnose symptoms from different behaviours. However there are various challenges that need to be addressed ranging from issues with sensors to the involvement of human factors. It is vital that these challenges are taken into consideration along with the major behavioural symptoms that can appear in an Elderly Person. For a person suffering with Dementia, the application of sensor technologies can improve the quality of life of the person and also monitor the progress of the disease through behavioural analysis. This paper will consider the behaviours that can be associated with dementia and how these behaviours can be monitored through sensor technology. We will also provide an insight into some sensors and algorithms gathered through survey in order to provide advantages and disadvantages of these technologies as well as to present any challenges that may face future research.},   keywords={assisted living;behavioural sciences computing;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;human factors;patient monitoring;smart phones;Internet of Things;behavioural symptoms;noninvasive monitoring;elderly person care;behaviour analytics;behavioural analysis;sensor technology;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Dementia;Senior citizens;Smart phones;Heart rate;Internet of Things;healthcare;behaviour analytics},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.133},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;patient centric agent;privacy;PCA based architecture;continuous time patient monitoring architecture;real time patient monitoring architecture;continuous patient monitoring;block architecture;continuous remote patient monitoring;RPM architectures;RPM challenging;tier-based End to End architecture;healthcare;Internet of Things;IoT;Computer architecture;Medical services;Principal component analysis;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Blockchain;body area sensor network;healthcare;remote patient monitoring;patient centric agent;proof of work;streamed data;Internet of Things;dynamically generated session key;patient record encryption key},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846779},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={32258-32285},   abstract={Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;parallel processing;protocols;quality of service;smart cities;smart cities;mobile cloud computing;future healthcare demands;network latency;next-generation healthcare;ubiquitous healthcare framework;edge computing;deep learning;high-performance computing;HPC;network traffic;network layers;data rates;data caching;application protocols;anomalous data;Big Data;UbeHealth system;personalized ubiquitous cloud computing;edge-enabled networked healthcare system;personalized healthcare;patient data analysis;reliability;Internet of Things;IoT;enhanced network quality of service;routing decisions;traffic flows;malicious traffic detection;Medical services;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Quality of service;Machine learning;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Cloudlets;deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile edge computing;mobile healthcare;preventive healthcare;traffic classification;traffic prediction;survey;fog computing;cloud computing;multimedia applications;smart cities},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846609},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={325-331},   abstract={The current emphasis on sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems, more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems”, has the potential to give rise to a new generation of systems and services encompassing several domains such as e-Governance, healthcare, transportation, waste management, energy &amp; utilities, insurance, etc., resulting in the metamorphosis of the Internet as we see it, into the Internet of Things (IoT). One probable commonality in each of these services will be the abundance of different types of data from different sources with the success of the systems depending on real-time or near real-time analysis of data. Such analyses are normally performed via well-known algorithms with a time-constraint on the execution, thus creating a requirement for parallel execution techniques. Some of these analyses may have a higher frequency of execution on a relatively small set of data, in which case the current big-data frameworks may actually add an overhead. Further, the frameworks like Hadoop demand the algorithms to be mapped onto a particular paradigm, which may not always be a suitable option. This paper, which is a work-in-progress, provides an experience report on the use of Condor, a well known Grid framework, for data-parallel “black-box” style execution of analysis algorithms in the context of Internet of Things. We concentrate on algorithms which are already in use, and can be partitioned into data-parallel subtasks without any modification and use Condor, which has traditionally been used for high-performance or high-throughput computing, as the execution framework.},   keywords={data analysis;data mining;grid computing;Internet of Things;mobile computing;parallel processing;data parallel analytics;IoT context;sensor-based intelligent systems;ubiquitous systems;cyber-physical systems;real-time data analysis;near real-time data analysis;parallel execution techniques;big-data frameworks;data-parallel black-box style execution;high-performance computing;high-throughput computing;execution framework;mobile data mining;grid framework;data-parallel subtasks;Internet of Things;Condor;Computer architecture;Context;Intelligent sensors;Algorithm design and analysis;Wind turbines;Internet;cyber-physical;ubiquitous systems;analytics;parallel execution;black-box;mobile data mining;mobile grid},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673380},   ISSN={2160-4886},   month={Oct},}

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},   keywords={body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;healthcare;power consumption;statistical techniques;bandwidth consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;wireless human gait monitoring system;Decision support systems;Internet;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Body Area Networks},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2018},   volume={22},   number={6},   pages={1711-1719},   abstract={Facial expressions are among behavioral signs of pain that can be employed as an entry point to develop an automatic human pain assessment tool. Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the intensive care unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a biosensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things (IoT) system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system acts as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application. In summary, this study proposes a scalable IoT system for real-time biopotential monitoring and a wearable solution for automatic pain assessment via facial expressions.},   keywords={Pain;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Cloud computing;Servers;Mobile communication;Tools;Biopotential sensor node;cloud computing;healthcare internet-of-things (IoT);pain assessment;wearable sensors;web-based UI for IoT applications},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2017.2776351},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={42-49},   abstract={In recent years, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has already been implemented in numerous application domains, such as smart city, intelligent healthcare assistant, and smart transportation management. Researchers or developers associated with these domains frequently require diverse types of IoT devices to implement or test their IoT related innovations. However, building an IoT-testbed by purchasing these IoT devices in every few months is infeasible considering that most of them will be used only for a small amount of time and will become obsolete with the arrival of an upgraded version of those devices. Instead, a better approach would be rented out the IoT devices in on-demand, just-in-time, and pay for only the time the devices are used basis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose IoTbed - an architecture to deliver a large scale Testbed as a service using the IoT devices located in the users' proximal networks. IoTbed enables testbed providers to build their testbeds in the edge of the network and allows easy and secure access for IoT service providers to run experiments on those testbeds. IoTbed presents an economic model that offers monetary incentives to the device owners for using their devices in the testbed experiments. We posit that such an incentive model will encourage more testbed providers to rent out their smart devices through IoTbed. To demonstrate the feasibility of IoTbed, we implemented a prototype of IoTbed to run on Contiki powered IoT devices and evaluated the performance.},   keywords={Internet of Things;IoT devices;IoT related innovations;testbed providers;IoT service providers;smart devices;IoTbed;Internet of Things-based systems;users proximal networks;Monitoring;Logic gates;ZigBee;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Big Data;Internet of Things;Testbed;Incentive;Architecture;Contiki;Cooja},   doi={10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.14},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={206-211},   abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},   keywords={cardiology;cardiovascular system;diseases;electroencephalography;Haar transforms;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;time series;individual physiological time series;biosignal processing system;Haar Transform;IoT application;Internet of Things;blood pressure;heart rate;EEG;chronic diseases;urgent diseases;cardiovascular disease;Time series analysis;Transforms;Correlation;Physiology;Medical services;Market research;Euclidean distance;time series;correlation;Haar wavelet;Haar transform;distance measure;clustering;healthcare;IoT},   doi={10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54},   ISSN={2471-7819},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={There are many recent revolutionary advances in information technology that include: wireless communication, the spread of mobile devices, and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). IoT will have an important role in connecting almost everything (mobile devices, cameras, home appliances, healthcare devices, military equipments, ..., etc) to the Internet via different communication technologies such as Wi-Fi. This connection will have impact on many sectors of our life such as industry, economy, social life, and ICT sector. Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT. Then, we present the recent timing and fault Side Channel Attacks on cryptosystem implementations for the most secure encryption algorithms (AES, ECC, and RSA). Also, the countermeasures to protect these cryptosystems from such attacks are also presented.},   keywords={Internet of Things;public key cryptography;standards;Internet of Things;side channel attacks;IoT;AES;elliptic curve cryptography;RSA;ECC;advanced encryption standard;Elliptic curve cryptography;Timing;Encryption;Internet;Side-channel attacks;Cryptography;Side Channel Attacks;Privacy;IoT},   doi={10.1109/AICCSA.2016.7945813},   ISSN={2161-5330},   month={Nov},}

It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT. There is a great need to design and develop a lightweight secure authentication model, which offers significant security level against multiple attacks such as mainly: Impersonation attacks, man in the middle attack and unknown key sharing attacks for IoT base E-health domain.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={903-907},   abstract={Connected data has always been considered as a primary source to knowledge. Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable. Rather it adds to the foundation notion of ubiquitous services by making available to everyone and everywhere.

This IoT/M2M connectivity technology is deployed at the sub-1 GHz ISM bands, that are subject to various coexistence regulations set by the authorities. In Europe, devices in the Sub-1 GHz ISM bands must comply with the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%, provided that they also support Listen Before Talk (LBT) and Adaptive Frequency Agility (AFA) features. In this article we investigate the challenges of such duty cycle limitation and its effect on the IEEE 802.11ah network performance from the uplink transmission perspective, considering typical use cases characterized by different traffic models. We first derive the theoretical maximum duty cycles of both an individual station and an individual AP assuming full-buffer or saturated traffic. Then, with emphasis on more practical uses cases, such as home/building automation and healthcare, where the traffic of an individual station or node is strongly unsaturated, we analyze the IEEE 802.11ah network performance without and with the 2.8% maximum duty cycle limitation. The obtained results show IEEE 802.11ah networks can provide efficient support for the most important use cases such as sensor networking, home automation and healthcare, despite the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%. This shows that IEEE 802.11ah is one of the most prominent and scalable IoT/M2M connectivity technology, that can enable different types of IoT applications, even in the presence of the tight coexistence requirements at the ISM band.},   keywords={},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Most embedded systems utilize software-based security mechanisms such as right management or cryptography, nevertheless they can be easily defeated by hardware attacks if no specific care is given during the development of the software. Consequently, it is necessary to provide software developers with efficient tools to assist in designing robust embedded systems against hardware security threats. In this work, we focus on medical embedded systems including a microcontroller unit (MCU) running the main application. We firstly show that the software running on the MCU is vulnerable against hardware attacks; then, we present an evaluation platform dedicated to MCU-based design to evaluate and secure software early in the design phase. We finally present preliminary results obtained with this platform, considering the side channel resilience of modern MCUs.},   keywords={Hardware;Software;Cryptography;Tools;Medical services;Safety;Hardware security;Internet of Things (IoT);embedded security;Hardware attacks;power supply glitch attack},   doi={10.1109/IVSW.2018.8494843},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules. Experimental results have shown that the RealAlert scheme can accurately assess the trust of the sensor nodes as well as data in IoT.},   keywords={Internet of Things;security of data;smart cities;wireless channels;IoT devices;trustworthy sensing scheme;critical smart city applications;smart grid;smart building;IoT data;wireless network;policy-based secure sensing;Internet of Things;smart object network;intelligent transportation;mobile healthcare;fake data generation;RealAlert scheme;Security;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Sensors;Smart grids;Data collection;Context;Internet of Things (IoT);policy;security;smart city;trust},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2720635},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={35801-35808},   abstract={In this paper, a wireless implantable sensor prototype with subcutaneous solar energy harvesting is proposed. To evaluate the performance of a flexible solar panel under skin, ex-vivo experiments are conducted under natural sunlight and artificial light sources. The results show that the solar panel covered by a 3 mm thick porcine flap can output tens of microWatts to a few milliWatts depending on the light conditions. The subcutaneous solar energy harvester is tested on different body parts, which suggests the optimal position for the harvester to implant is between neck and shoulder. A wireless implantable system powered by the subcutaneous energy harvester is presented, which consists of a power management circuit, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth low energy module. An application is developed for data visualization on mobile devices, which can be a gateway for future IoT-based healthcare applications. The entire device is embedded in a transparent silicone housing (38 mm × 32 mm × 4 mm), including a 7 mAh rechargeable battery for energy storage. The average power consumption of the implants is about 30 μW in a 10 min operation cycle. With the subcutaneous solar energy harvester, the self-powered operation of the implantable sensor prototype is demonstrated by long-term experimental results.

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual.

Moreover, with the help of software defined networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any trusted third party. Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching.

Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules.

For localizing a moving object in WSNs, generally, a set of location-aware static WSN nodes are used to localize the mobile nodes or moving target using a specific localization algorithm. RSSI and Trilateration based location identification is a well-known traditional method which needs distance calculation prior to localization. Many researchers have modified the traditional trilateration method to better suit their application or in general.

We propose a new authentication mechanism based on the state of the art protocol μTESLA, that aims to reduce the delay of forged packets in the receivers buffer, by efficiently computing the key disclosure delay. Then, we integrate this mechanism to two protocols of state of the art LEAP and LEAP++. Furthermore, we assess the feasibility of our solution with a thorough simulation study, taking into account the energy consumption, the delay of forged packets, and the authentication delay.},   keywords={cryptographic protocols;energy consumption;Internet of Things;authentication delay;energy consumption;LEAP++;receivers buffer;forged packet delay;μTESLA;resource constrained devices;broadcast authentication;secure protocol;smart cities;healthcare;home monitoring;smart object;IoT;Internet of Things;resource constrained device;secure authentication mechanism;Authentication;Delays;Protocols;Sensors;Receivers;Wireless sensor networks;Broadcast authentication;Authentication Protocols;Key Disclosure Delay;μTESLA;WSN},   doi={10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507270},   ISSN={2161-5330},   month={Nov},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={466-469},   abstract={Diabetic ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},   keywords={cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones;flexible wound assessment system;diabetic patient;Android smartphone;diabetic ulcers;wound assessment;visual examination;wound size;healing status;caregivers;high-resolution digital camera;chronic ulcer image analysis;wound image analysis system;Android App;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;skin color;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;Wounds;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Diabetes;Algorithm design and analysis;Smart phones;Patients with diabetes;Android Smartphones;Android App;RGB color evaluation;Mean Shift Algorithm},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Global health which denotes equitable access to healthcare, particularly in remote-rural-developing regions, is characterized by unique challenges of affordability, accessibility, and availability for which one of the most promising technological interventions that is emerging is the Internet of Things (IoT) based remote health monitoring. We present an IoT based smart edge system for remote health monitoring, in which wearable vital sensors transmit data into two novel software engines, namely Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis (RASPRO) and Criticality Measure Index (CMI) alerts, both of which we have implemented in the IoT smart edge. RASPRO transforms voluminous sensor data into clinically meaningful summaries called Personalized Health Motifs (PHMs). The CMI alerts engine computes an aggregate criticality score. Our IoT smart edge employs a risk-stratified protocol consisting of rapid guaranteed push of alerts &amp; PHMs directly to the physicians, and best effort pull of detailed data-on-demand (DD-on-D) through the cloud. We have carried out both clinical validation and performance evaluation of our smart edge system. The clinical validation on 183 patients demonstrated that the IoT smart edge is highly effective in remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of cardiac conditions, as quantified by three measures, precision (0.87), recall (0.83), and F1-score (0.85). Furthermore, performance evaluation showed significant reductions in the bandwidth (98%) and energy (90%), thereby making it suitable for emerging narrow-band IoT networks. In the deployment of our system in the cardiology institute of our University hospital, we observed that our IoT smart edge helped to increase the availability of physicians by 59%. Hence, our IoT smart edge system is a significant step towards addressing the requirements for global health.},   keywords={Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Electrocardiography;Internet of Things;Logic gates;Biomedical monitoring},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2870068},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

However, these scenarios will critically rely on the large-scale deployed sensors that constantly transmit streaming data to cloud platform for real-time estimation, which brings the issue of privacy disclosure since smart devices will gather kinds of data including personal sensitive information. Meanwhile, there is not some universal method to solve privacy problem in 5G because of diversified security needs for different applications. In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter based differentially private steaming data share scheme is proposed to protect user privacy for cloud platform in IoT. The proposed method can ensure that released data will not compromise individual privacy, and improve the utility of released data simultaneously. The proposed scheme is evaluated by four real-world datasets and compared with the results of utility optimization scheme based on Kalman filter.

There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario. Finally, we conducted a scalability analysis to determine the feasibility of deploying IReHMo in large numbers in regions of north Sweden.},   keywords={biomedical communication;data communication;geriatrics;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;IReHMo;IoT-based remote health monitoring system;smart regions;ageing population;home stay;healthcare data;network requirements;bandwidth requirements;data generation;network communication protocols;CoAP;MQTT;HTTP;single sensor event;scalability analysis;north Sweden;Monitoring;Protocols;Senior citizens;Logic gates;Bandwidth;Encryption;remote health monitoring;Internet of Things;sensor communication;eHealth;smart city;smart region},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454565},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-11},   abstract={An ultra-low power electrocardiogram (ECG) processing architecture with an adequate level of accuracy is a necessity for Internet of Things (IoT) medical wearable devices. This paper presents a novel real-time QRS detector and an ECG compression architecture for IoT healthcare devices. An absolute-value curve length transform (A-CLT) is proposed that effectively enhances the QRS complex detection with minimized hardware resources. The proposed architecture requires adders, shifters, and comparators only, and removes the need for any multipliers. QRS detection was accomplished by using adaptive thresholds in the A-CLT transformed ECG signal, and achieved a sensitivity of 99.37% and the predictivity of 99.38% when validated using Physionet ECG database. Furthermore, a lossless compression technique was incorporated into the proposed architecture that uses the ECG signal first derivative and entropy encoding. An average compression ratio of 2.05 was achieved when evaluated using MIT-BIH database. The proposed QRS detection architecture deals with almost all the ECG signal artifacts, such as low-frequency noise, baseline drift, and high-frequency interference with minimum hardware resources. The proposed QRS architecture was synthesized using 65-nm low-power process using standard-cell-based flow. The power consumption of the design was 6.5 nW while operating at a supply of 1 V and a frequency of 250 Hz. Moreover, the system could benefit from duty-cycling.},   keywords={Electrocardiography;Computer architecture;Transmitters;Medical services;Transforms;Low-power electronics;Power demand;Elecrocardiogram;QRS complex;computational complexity;absolute value curve length transform;compression.},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2018.2867746},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={},}

When the body is deprived of essential nutrients, it can lead to serious disease and organ deterioration which can cause serious health issues in adulthood. Automated monitoring of the nutritional content of food provided to infants, not only at home but also in daycare facilities, is essential for their healthy development.

In m-Healthcare, users' smartphones serve as bridges connecting their WBSNs and the healthcare center (HCC), i.e., send users' personal health information (PHI) collected by WBSNs to the HCC and receive the feedback. However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={96-101},   abstract={In the past decade, the revolution in miniaturization (microprocessors, batteries, cameras etc.) and manufacturing of new type of sensors resulted in a new regime of applications based on smart objects called IoT. Majority of such applications or services are to ease human life and/or to setup efficient processes in automated environments. However, this convenience is coming up with new challenges related to data security and human privacy. The objects in IoT are resource constrained devices and cannot implement a fool-proof security framework. These end devices work like eyes and ears to interact with the physical world and collect data for analytics to make expedient decisions. The storage and analysis of the collected data is done remotely using cloud computing. The transfer of data from IoT to the computing clouds can introduce privacy issues and network delays. Some applications need a real-time decision and cannot tolerate the delays and jitters in the network. Here, edge computing or fog computing plays its role to settle down the mentioned issues by providing cloud-like facilities near the end devices. In this paper, we discuss IoT, fog computing, the relationship between IoT and fog computing, their security issues and solutions by different researchers. We summarize attack surface related to each layer of this paradigm which will help to propose new security solutions to escalate it acceptability among end users. We also propose a risk-based trust management model for smart healthcare environment to cope with security and privacy-related issues in this highly un-predictable heterogeneous ecosystem.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer network security;data privacy;distributed processing;Internet of Things;computing clouds;edge computing;IoT;fog computing paradigm;cameras etc;smart objects;data security;human privacy;cloud computing;risk-based trust management model;heterogeneous ecosystem;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Privacy;Protocols;Computational modeling;Authentication;IoT;fog computing;security challenges;privacy issues;trust management},   doi={10.1109/LT.2018.8368491},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence. This paper presents the results of applying models to real clinical data. Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14).

Indicatively, real-time diagnosis of medical issues, telemedicine, remote monitoring of patients, as well as computer-assisted smart transportation in case of emergencies, are anticipated as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) that can execute several applications of different criticality, thus necessitating mission-critical and non-critical peripheral components. Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system.

The emergence of the Internet of Things and pervasive healthcare paradigms requires seamless and efficient information flow from patients' body area networks (BANs) to the wider Internet. This brings forward the challenges of integration of various isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with Internet. This paper addresses the use of the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol for integrating small scale BANs for vital signs monitoring to the wider Internet.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed rapidly to make our life easier. In many IoT applications (e.g., smart homes, healthcare, etc.), all the IoT devices should be synchronized in time. However, some malicious nodes located in the IoT network can influence the time synchronization, which may interrupt the IoT system and lead to serious accidents. Therefore, it is critical and challenging to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of time during the time synchronization among all the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme to assure the security during time synchronization in IoT. Specifically, a publicly verifiable ledger is utilized to record and broadcast time, which can minimize many attacks from external environments. The use of multiple time sources can avoid the vulnerabilities caused by the centralized generation of accurate time. Moreover, the decentralized structure of this scheme has the advantage of adapting the changes of network topology. By employing an improved Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, time synchronization can be implemented efficiently. At last, the analysis results show that our proposed scheme can achieve the desired security with high efficiency.},   keywords={Synchronization;Protocols;Internet of Things;Robustness;Internet of Things;Time Synchronization;Blockchain;Security.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2874222},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In this paper, the benefits of healthcare IoT system and the possible vulnerabilities that may result are presented. Also, we propose to develop solutions against these vulnerabilities by protecting mobile applications using obfuscation and return oriented programming techniques. These techniques convert an application into a form which makes difficult for an adversary to interpret or alter the code for illegitimate purpose.

The reference nodes or beacons forward the information gathered from target node to a central receiver attached to a computer. A program is developed to read the incoming signals to the receiver module for processing. This program calculate the distance between target node (unknown location) and each reference node (known location), and then it determines the position of the call button which held by the patient. In parallel, nurses hold smart phones, and the position is determined via WiFi-Based Positioning System (WPS). Both systems are combined and linked to the nurse calling system.

However, the hierarchy structure of shared files has not been explored in CP-ABE. In this paper, an efficient file hierarchy attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed in cloud computing. The layered access structures are integrated into a single access structure, and then, the hierarchical files are encrypted with the integrated access structure. The ciphertext components related to attributes could be shared by the files. Therefore, both ciphertext storage and time cost of encryption are saved.

Our prototype consists of a complete vertical solution with a series of advantages with respect to the state of the art, considering both the prototypes with integrated front end and prototypes realized with off-the-shelf components: 1) ECG prototype sensors with record-low energy per effective number of quantized levels; 2) an architecture providing low marginal cost per added sensor/user; and 3) the possibility of seamless integration with other smart home systems through a single IoT infrastructure.},   keywords={biomedical electronics;biomedical telemetry;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;low-power wearable ECG monitoring system;multiple-patient remote monitoring;remote electrocardiogram monitoring;smart home solutions;nontechnical users;long-term health monitoring;residential environments;broader Internet-of-Things infrastructure;complete vertical solution;integrated front end;off-the-shelf components;record-low energy;ECG prototype sensors;single IoT infrastructure;Sensors;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Protocols;Servers;Data visualization;multiple-patient monitoring;ECG;ZigBee;IoT;healthcare;Multiple-patient monitoring;ECG;ZigBee;IoT;healthcare},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2016.2564995},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={July},}

 title={Analog Signal Compression and Multiplexing Techniques for Healthcare Internet of Things}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={398-406},   abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},   keywords={biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;Internet of Things;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;Analog Signal compression;multiplexing technique;traffic data;IoT applications;power consumption;IoT devices;encoding method;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;analog domain;AJSCC device;analog encoding;FPMM receiver;joint modulation;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;multisignal compression method;FPMM technique;healthcare Internet of Things;IoT scalability;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;power saving;SNR operating region;miss detection rate;mean square error;Medical services;Sensors;Power demand;Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Shannon Mapping;Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.62},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems.

IIoT is used in a wide range of applications such as transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy management in smart grids. Most of the solutions reported in the literature for secure communications are not suitable for the aforementioned applications due to the usage of traditional TCP/IP-based network infrastructure. So, to handle this challenge, in this paper, a software-defined network (SDN) enabled multi-attribute secure communication model for an IIoT environment is designed. The proposed scheme works in three phases: 1) an SDN-IIoT communication model is designed using a cuckoo-filter-based fast-forwarding scheme, 2) an attribute-based encryption scheme is presented for secure data communication, and 3) a peer entity authentication scheme using a third party authenticator, Kerberos , is also presented. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using different parameters where the results obtained prove its effectiveness in comparison to the existing solutions.},   keywords={computer network security;cryptography;data communication;Internet of Things;smart power grids;software defined networking;smart grid;network infrastructure;multiattribute secure communication model;IIoT environment;SDN-IIoT communication model;fast-forwarding scheme;secure data communication;peer entity authentication scheme;smart connected devices;attribute-based encryption scheme;industrial Internet of Things;TCP-IP-based network infrastructure;SDN-Enabled multiattribute-based secure communication;software-defined network;third party authenticator;Kerberos;cuckoo-filter-based fast-forwarding scheme;Smart devices;Authentication;Real-time systems;Informatics;Data models;Encryption;Attribute-based encryption;cuckoo filter;industrial Internet of things (IIoT);kerberos;software-defined networks (SDN)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2789442},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={June},}

These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City.

IoT networks are expected to integrate billions of small devices to the Internet enabling countless applications ranging from automation of cities to home based healthcare solutions for elderly and vulnerable population. Such wide range of application pose unique challenges such as the need for high reliability, ultra low power and low delay communications. In addition to these challenges, such Internet enabled small devices will have to be equipped with the necessary security suits to cope with security challenges posed by the Internet. Furthermore, these solutions have to address such unique challenges via a micro controller generally with a limited processing power and memory consuming as little energy as possible.

Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen.

Nevertheless, one can be data-rich and knowledge-poor, and this is where the data analytics and the development and application of machine learning models become necessity for gaining insight of complex processes to prove scientific theories and discoveries, support decision making and enhance strategic planning in different areas of the economy, finance, industry, healthcare, etc. Recently, there is an influx of polymorphic, unstructured and multimodal data - social media, images, audio, video, etc., which is complicating further the data processing and knowledge extraction process. But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that. Then will briefly talk about supervised and unsupervised learning and the use of three supervised approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Random Forests (RF); and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving radar signal classification and source identification problem. Results from applying the NN, RF and SVM (using R and Matlab) on complete data subset (without missing data) and the full dataset with substituted (up to 60%) missing data with MI, KNN-I and BTl will be critically analysed and discussed.

For this promising class of m-Health services, we introduce reference scenarios of personalized assistance for a mobile patient with focus on emergency cases.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={335-342},   abstract={With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart sensor technologies, the data-driven paradigm has been found promising to support human behavioral analysis in a smart home for better healthcare and well-being of senior adults. This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.},   keywords={Bayes methods;behavioural sciences;data mining;health care;home automation;intelligent sensors;intelligent structures;Internet of Things;matrix decomposition;mobile computing;pattern clustering;vectors;Bayesian nominal matrix factorization;activity pattern mining;Internet of Things;IoT;smart sensor technologies;data-driven paradigm;human behavioral analysis;smart home;health care;senior adult well-being;sensor data collection;nominal data matrix decomposition;basis vectors;hierarchical probabilistic model;ordinal matrix factorization;Bayesian lasso;human interpretation;basis vector reconstruction accuracy;daily activity routine analysis;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Manganese;Smart homes;Robustness;Nominal matrix factorization;probabilistic hierarchical model;Bayesian inference;routine pattern discovery},   doi={10.1109/WI.2016.0054},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={33-38},   abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={149-153},   abstract={Many application scenarios for IoT (Internet of Things) require the interconnection of high speed sensing nodes with data rates of Gbps. As an example surveillance or smart mobility applications adopt multiple photo and video cameras working at different spectral range (visible, near infrared, far infrared) and covering different fields of view, or they exploit arrays of radio/light detection and ranging (Radar/Lidar) sensors to detect the presence of targets, of their speeds, distance and direction. Even the access of distributed nodes in IoT towards a centralized cloud storage/processing center requires high data rate connections. Since low size and low weight of the nodes are needed, IoT can benefit from the high communication data rate, several Gbps, that can be provided by fully integrated mm-wave wireless transceivers. The wavelength at such frequency is few mm and hence the whole transceiver including the antenna can be integrated in a single chip. To this aim, this paper presents the design of 60 GHz transceiver key blocks (Low Noise Amplifier, Power Amplifier, Antenna) to ensure connection distances up to 10 m and data rate of several Gbps. Around 60 GHz worldwide there are freely-available (unlicensed) several GHz of bandwidth. By using a CMOS SOI technology RF, analog and digital baseband circuitry can be integrated in the same chip minimizing noise coupling. Even the antenna is integrated on chip reducing cost and size vs. classic off-chip antenna solutions. The proposed transceiver allows for the implementation of low cost nodes for IoT systems with data rates of several Gbps and with a 10 m link distance. These specifications are suitable for home/office scenarios, or for body area networks (healthcare, wellness) or for applications on board vehicles (cars, trains, ships, airplanes).},   keywords={body area networks;body sensor networks;CMOS integrated circuits;Internet of Things;millimetre wave amplifiers;millimetre wave antennas;mobility management (mobile radio);optical radar;radio transceivers;sensor arrays;silicon-on-insulator;millimetre-wave integrated wireless transceivers;high bandwidth connections;IoT systems;Internet-of-things;high speed sensing nodes;high communication data rate;smart mobility applications;radio detection-and-ranging sensor array;light detection-and-ranging sensor array;centralized cloud storage center;centralized cloud processing center;CMOS SOI technology RF;analog baseband circuitry;digital baseband circuitry;noise coupling minimization;wireless sensor networks;frequency 60 GHz;Gain;Transceivers;CMOS integrated circuits;Wireless sensor networks;CMOS technology;Noise figure;Antennas;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);IoT (Internet of Things);High-speed network;mm-wave integrated transceiver},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389043},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M&amp;lt;;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},   keywords={cognitive radio;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;multi armed bandit channel access scheme;cognitive radio technology;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;spectrum scarcity problem;fair channel-grouping scheme;water-filling principle;distributed learning algorithm;Internet of things;Wireless sensor networks;Cognitive radio;Medical services;Agriculture;I.I.D. multi-armed bandit;fairness access scheme;channel-grouping;modified UCB-tuned},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2600633},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},   keywords={authorisation;electronic health records;granular computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic matching;semantic rule reasoning;personal health record;role-based access control;attribute-based access control;granular security concepts;ontology;social care providers;health care providers;granularity levels;patient-specified authorization policies;RABAC;local security policies;data access;patient-centered model;healthcare information systems;information storage;healthcare professional component;health information transmission;medical device component;nonhealthcare providers;social information collection;health information collection;nonhealthcare component;patient data;IOT;Internet of things;cloud computing;virtual PHR authorization system;Authorization;Ontologies;Medical services;Cloud computing;Semantics;Filtering},   doi={10.1109/BHI.2014.6864307},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={June},}

Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments.

This algorithm is our proposal for a wearable ECG diagnosis device, suitable for 24-hour continuous monitoring of the patient. We use Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for the ECG analysis, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The best classification accuracy achieved is 98.9%, for a feature vector of size 18, and 2493 support vectors. Different implementations of the algorithm on the Galileo board, help demonstrate that the computational cost is such, that the ECG analysis and classification can be performed in real-time.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;body sensor networks;cardiovascular system;discrete wavelet transforms;diseases;electrocardiography;embedded systems;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal classification;support vector machines;ECG signal analysis;arrhythmia detection;IoT wearable medical devices;healthcare;Internet of Things technology;remote health monitoring;chronic diseases;cardiovascular diseases;CVD;ECG classification;heartbeat diagnosis;IoT-based embedded platform;wearable ECG diagnosis device;continuous monitoring;Discrete Wavelet Transform;DWT;Support Vector Machine classifier;SVM;classification accuracy;Galileo board;Electrocardiography;Heart beat;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Discrete wavelet transforms;Internet of things;Algorithm design and analysis;ECG analysis;ECG heartbeat classification;Support-Vector-Machine (SVM);Discrete-Wavelet-Transform (DWT);Internet-of-Things (IoT);Embedded Systems},   doi={10.1109/MOCAST.2016.7495143},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Their true impact on patient care is highly dependent on the quality and relevancy of the data acquired. The design of circuits and systems to answer the growing demand and the necessity to have portable and connected devices lead to a focus on designing ultra-low power apparatus, mixed-signal devices, using nanoscale electronics. Microelectronic issues are therefore at the heart of the demand. All this requires inter-disciplinary collaborations between scientists, engineers, medical researchers, and practitioners. The interconnection of these embedded devices, known as Internet of Things, is expected to usher in the medical field, among others to study the cardiovascular system of patients.

Examples of such systems include automotive and transportation systems, mobile equipment transported by people or animals (including wearable or implantable systems), mobile robots, etc. For the CPS and IoT chip market as high as 30% annual growth rate is predicted for the period 2013-2020 (Gartner, Oct. 2014) that will be mainly driven by the need for low-power embedded processing, communications and sensing for mobile CPS sectors like smart automotive, wireless communication and wearables, with smart healthcare wearables growing at 65% a year to $41 billion in 2020 (Soreon Research, Oct. 2014).},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile computing;wearable systems;mobile systems;sensor technologies;big stimulus;smart communicating cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;Internet-connected devices;smart automotive systems;transportation systems;mobile equipment;mobile robots;IoT chip market;embedded processing;mobile CPS sectors;wireless communication;smart healthcare wearables;Mobile communication;Embedded computing;Bars;Robot sensing systems;Automotive engineering;Systems architecture;Transportation},   doi={10.1109/MECO.2016.7525680},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},   keywords={cognition;health care;home computing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;cognitive health assessment;IoT;signal processing;machine learning techniques;technology-guided algorithmic methodology;smart home health service systems;Alzheimers patients;retirement community centers;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917641},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

The growth of the Internet shows no signs of slowing down and it steadily becomes the cause of a new pervasive paradigm in computing and communications. This new paradigm enhances the traditional Internet into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) created around intelligent interconnections of diverse objects in the physical world, such as vehicles, cell phones, habitats, and habitat occupants. It utilizes low-cost information gathering and dissemination devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, that facilitate fast-paced interactions among the objects themselves as well as the objects and persons in any place and at any time. IoT will usher in a wide range of smart applications and services to cope with many of the challenges individuals and organizations face in their everyday lives. For example, remote healthcare monitoring systems could aid in managing costs and alleviating the shortage of healthcare personnel; intelligent transportation systems could aid in reducing traffic congestion and inevitably the ills caused by it such as air pollution; smart distribution systems from utility grids to supply chains could aid in improving the quality and reducing the cost of their respective goods and services; tagged objects could result in more systematic recycling and effective waste disposal, and so on.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Internet;Mobile communication;Computer applications},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069706},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={November},}

 title={Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={xi-xiv},   abstract={In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of D<sup>n</sup>y for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.},   keywords={},   doi={10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

 title={Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities}, 
  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2-3},   abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain and the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},   keywords={Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;smart data;Big Data;personalized digital health;metadata;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;semantic perception;ontologies;domain models;vocabularies;semantic interoperability;continuous semantics;Big Data volume;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity},   doi={10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={389-394},   abstract={The market sizes of each IoT application are relatively smaller than the PC and smartphone, although the development and production cost of the LSIs are becoming high. The LSI designers should find the ways to get funding of their development. One way is to get funding from providing system solution or service applications with expanding business models from supplying devices, as well as reducing the LSI costs and making the production volume larger. The pressure to expand the device supplying model depends on each application market, so such status of each application is to be discussed and also whether the expansion of the model is really necessary and practical or not.},   keywords={elemental semiconductors;Internet of Things;large scale integration;silicon;silicon value;Internet of Things;IoT;PC;smartphone;LSI designers;Si;Educational institutions;Electrical engineering;Awards activities;Patents;Medical services;Mobile communication;Committees},   doi={10.1109/ASSCC.2014.7008941},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

 title={A changing landscape: Securing the Internet of Things (IoT): Keynote talk}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;Internet of Things;radio links;security of data;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things security;IoT security;wireless sensor networking;machine-2-machine communication;M2M communication;wireless bodyworn sensing device security;health infrastructure;medical applications;symmetric spatiotemporal characteristics;wireless link;link fingerprint matching;data session},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457124},   ISSN={},   month={March},}
