 title={Automatic Ocular Disease Screening and Monitoring Using a Hybrid Cloud System}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={263-268},   abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;image classification;Internet of Things;medical image processing;hybrid cloud system;healthcare IT systems;advanced image and data analysis techniques;medical devices;cloud-based system;advanced pattern classification algorithms;ophthalmologists;disease detection;ocular disease screening;Diseases;Cloud computing;Retina;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Internet of Things;healthcare;ocular diseases;disease screening;computer aided diagnosis;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.68},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Today, a common method for delivery of such applications is via component-based software engineering disciplines based on cloud computing technologies such as containers. However, there are still numerous technological challenges to be solved particularly related to the time-critical Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of such applications. Runtime variations in the workload intensity as the amount of service tasks to be processed may radically affect the application performance perceived by the end-users or lead to the underutilization of resources. In order to assure the QoS of these containerized applications, monitoring is required at both container and application levels. Currently, there is a great lack of such multi-level monitoring systems.

 title={Energy efficient IoT thermometer based on fuzzy logic for fever monitoring}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;fuzzy logic;health care;Internet of Things;pacemakers;patient monitoring;telemetry;thermometers;Remote Digital Blood Pressure;energy issues;energy consumption;data transmission;monitoring fever body temperature;HI-Thermo;adaptive system;fuzzy logic;Hi-Thermo;fever body temperature monitoring;existing traditional monitoring;energy efficient IoT;fever monitoring;Information Communication Technology;health services;digital systems;WIFI digital thermometer;Telemetry Digital Pacemaker;HI;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Testing;Healthcare;Monitoring;Digital;Logic fuzzy;Thermometer;IoT},   doi={10.1109/ICoICT.2017.8074640},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Networked body sensing devices coupled with sensors in our living environment enable the real-time and continuous collection of information related to an individual's physical and mental health and related behaviors. Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques. A set of representative health applications that take advantage of such tools is also described.

This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility.},   keywords={decision making;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;security of data;trusted computing;health IoT system;environmental health community;collective knowledge base;trust-based decision making;trust-based information sharing;trust-based health IoT protocol;Decision making;Protocols;Security;Internet of Things;Sensors;Reliability;Medical services;Decision trust;health Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);trust management;trust-based decision making},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2736446},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

To validate the usability of the interconnected PHR system, a clinical trial is underway to develop an obesity management model from individuals' hospital-provided genomic data, on the one hand, and diet and exercise logs gathered by the mobile application, on the other. We demonstrate how the proposed IoT Cloud based PHR ecosystem is interoperable and practical for promoting healthcare big data analysis services.},   keywords={Big Data;biomedical communication;cloud computing;cryptography;data analysis;electronic health records;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical computing;mobile computing;interconnected personal health record ecosystem;IoT Cloud platform;HL7 FHIR;personal health record systems;interconnected PHR system;healthcare data communication standards;interoperable hospital information system;electronic medical records;public cloud;PHR gateway repository;IoT module;mobile application;healthcare communication standard;PHR ecosystem;healthcare big data analysis services;obesity management model;hospital-provided genomic data;diet logs;exercise logs;IoT Cloud based PHR ecosystem;encrypted data sharing;big data analysis services;life log data;Cloud computing;Hospitals;Mobile applications;Biomedical imaging;Ecosystems;Information systems;PHR;healthcare;IoT;cloud;ARTIK;HL7;FHIR},   doi={10.1109/ICHI.2017.82},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={60-67},   abstract={Internet-based solutions, enhanced by Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud computing, are constantly driving revolutionary approaches in multiple domains, including healthcare. Indicatively, telemedicine, real-time diagnosis and remote monitoring of patients, are expected to transform the healthcare domain. These systems may offer several services of different criticality, necessitating safety-/mission-critical core components and non-critical peripheral components; in other words, they are complex, mixed-criticality System-of-Systems (SoS). To understand and design such systems, engineers must be facilitated with the appropriate modeling tools. In this work, we explore the application of model-based design, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), of IoT e-Health systems, emphasizing criticality requirements. We focus on the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS) use case, combining IoT technologies with classic healthcare practices, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. Requirements comprise a basic concept of a systematic model-driven methodology that enables the successful management of the criticalities in system design, implementation and deployment. In the REMS use case, identified criticalities are modeled as SysML requirements, while SysML constraints and parametric diagrams are employed to describe and verify quantitative criticality requirements.},   keywords={cloud computing;formal specification;formal verification;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;SysML;systems analysis;mixed-criticality System-of-Systems;model-based design;Systems Modeling Language;Remote Elderly Monitoring System;IoT technologies;system design;SysML requirements;model-based approach;e-Health IoT Systems;Internet-based solutions;healthcare domain;modeling tools;model-driven methodology;healthcare practices;Internet of Things;cloud computing;criticality requirements management;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Senior citizens;Cloud computing;Unified modeling language;Databases;Internet of Things;Healthcare;Model-Driven Engineering;SysML;Remote Elderly Monitoring;Criticalities;Requirements},   doi={10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428764},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},   keywords={Medical services;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Servers;Prototypes;Senior citizens;Wireless communication;Context-aware data forwarding strategy;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);named data networking of things;NDN;NDNoT.},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723843},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Mobile edge computing helps healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) devices with energy harvesting provide satisfactory quality of experiences for computation intensive applications. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme.},   keywords={Medical services;Privacy;Sensors;Energy consumption;Energy harvesting;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Internet of Things;healthcare systems;mobile edge offloading;energy harvesting;privacy;reinforcement learning.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2875926},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

To match the complex needs of such comprehensive set of different kinds of applications, in recent times there is an emerging need for new paradigms and forms of Clouds, organised according to a federated, heterogeneous and distributed structure. To exploit heterogeneity and localisation, in order to enhance the overall performances, ensure energy efficiency, reduce costs for resource providers and in the meantime enhance the user experience, proper service placement solutions are required. However, conducting efficient deployments in such a scenario is complex due to the dynamic nature of applications, resources, users. As a consequence, there the a need for scalable, distributed, adaptive, context-aware solutions characterised by high-efficiency and reduced overhead. We propose a highly distributed, self-adaptive solution aimed at optimising the overall deployment of cloud services by means of point-to-point interactions occurring among clouds and cloudlets belonging to the same federation.

It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={955-960},   abstract={In this paper we present an efficient and accurate algorithm for epileptic seizure prediction on low-power and portable IoT devices. State-of-the-art algorithms suffer from two issues: computation intensive features and large internal memory requirement, which make them inapplicable for constrained devices. We reduce the memory requirement of our algorithm by reducing the size of data segments (i.e. the window of input stream data on which the processing is performed), and the number of required EEG channels. To respect the limitations of the processing capability, we reduce the complexity of our exploited features by only considering the simple features, which also contributes to reducing the memory requirements. Then, we provide new relevant features to compensate the information loss due to the simplifications (i.e. less number of channels, simpler features, shorter segment, etc.). We measured the energy consumption (12.41 mJ) and execution time (565 ms) for processing each segment (i.e. 5.12 seconds of EEG data) on a low-power MSP432 device. Even though the state-of-art does not fit to IoT devices, we evaluate the classification performance and show that our algorithm achieves the highest AUC score (0.79) for the held-out data and outperforms the state-of-the-art.},   keywords={electroencephalography;Internet of Things;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;low-power MSP432 device;epileptic seizure prediction;portable IoT devices;internal memory requirement;EEG channels;EEG data;Electroencephalography;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Brain modeling;Memory management;Feature extraction;Epileptic Seizure Prediction;EEG;Healthcare;IoT;Embedded Systems;Constrained Devices},   doi={10.23919/DATE.2018.8342147},   ISSN={1558-1101},   month={March},}

Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and accessed by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while preventing unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system that supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},   keywords={authorisation;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;medical file;timely access;emergency medical care;healthcare IoT network;lightweight break-glass access control system;patient care;medical devices;healthcare IoT measure patients;healthcare workers;unauthorized access;patient files;emergency situations;medical worker;access policy;emergent situations;break-glass access mechanism;healthcare Internet-of-Things;Access control;Medical services;Cryptography;Biomedical imaging;Informatics;Hip;Cloud computing;Access control;break-glass;healthcare system;lightweight;secure Internet-of-Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2017.2751640},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Aug},}

This rated knowledge of various environments would enable a user's mobile device to automatically decide whether or not the user should visit this place/environment.

The emergency context demands efficient communication and computing capacities, and the cloud vision as well as traditional TCP/IP way of communication cannot really suit these requirements. New approaches are currently used : the fog computing paradigm, which describe the IoT environment in a more relevant way than the cloud vision, provides new performances as low latency, local storage opportunities, end-to-user services. E-health fogs have attracted a lot of attentions. To realize the efficient communication, E-Health systems also introduce Content-Centric Network (CCN) approach, whose characteristics include quick response, content distribution, IoT oriented technology. Nowadays, the existing E-health fog or CCN are seen as separate and autonomous networks, but many applications could require that those E-health fog computing systems exchange data, share processing results, or subscribe to each other information flux. In this paper we propose a solution for E-health systems to communicate by combining fog computing and CCN to provide communication efficiency and local storage opportunities. Finally we use simulation to evaluate the delay performances of our proposal.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;E-health fog computing systems;delay performances;autonomous networks;content distribution;CCN;Content-Centric Network approach;E-Health systems;end-to-user services;local storage opportunities;IoT environment;fog computing paradigm;emergency context;privacy matters;safe local storage spaces;life-dependency situations;IoT solutions;content-centric fog networks;Edge computing;Delays;Sensors;Protocols;Computer architecture;Routing;FOG computing;CCN;E-health;IoT},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210830},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In certain sense, indoor air quality must be paid more attention than outdoor air quality as people spend more time indoors than outdoors. The indoor environments are confined and closed compared to external environments providing less opportunity for the pollutants to dilute. With the advancement of technology, working places have become more automated using machines to carry out the tasks that were hitherto done manually. These devices emit various solids and gases into the environment during their operation. These emissions contain many substances that are harmful to human health, when exposed to them for a prolonged period of time or more than certain levels of concentration. This paper proposes an IoT based indoor air quality monitoring system for tracking the ozone concentrations near a photocopy machine. The experimental system with a semiconductor sensor capable of monitoring ozone concentrations was installed near a high volume photocopier. The IoT device has been programmed to collect and transmit data at an interval of five minutes over blue tooth connection to a gateway node that in turn communicates with the processing node via the WiFi local area network. The sensor was calibrated using the standard calibration methods. As an additional capability, the proposed air pollution monitoring system can generate warnings when the pollution level exceeds beyond a predetermined threshold value.},   keywords={air pollution;air quality;atmospheric composition;atmospheric techniques;geophysics computing;health and safety;indoor environment;ozone;proactive indoor air quality monitoring system;sustainable health management;external air pollution;outdoor air quality;indoor environments;external environments;human health;IoT enabled proactive indoor air quality monitoring system;ozone concentrations;photocopy machine;semiconductor sensor;high volume photocopier;IoT device;blue tooth connection;gateway node;WiFi local area network;standard calibration methods;air pollution monitoring;Air pollution;Gases;Monitoring;Standards organizations;Organizations;Internet of Things;indoor air quality;photocopier;ozone;primary pollutants;secondary pollutants},   doi={10.1109/ICCCT2.2017.7972281},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

One critical IoT application pertains to m-Health services which allow monitoring the health status of patients while providing the ability for a rapid response in emergency cases. Connecting healthcare services to the IoT brings forward new security threats and vulnerabilities that can jeopardize the patients' private data. In this paper, a novel security framework for m-Health IoT security is proposed using the concept of moving target defense (MTD). MTD allows the m-Health system to dynamically change its cryptographic keys to increase uncertainty on an attacker and secure the data. In the proposed scheme, the devices update their keys locally to eliminate the risk of revealing new keys while they are being shared with a gateway. A practical implementation is proposed based on bitslicing LED, a lightweight encryption cipher, to improve the performance of decrypting multiple packets at the same time. LED bitsliced implementation was tested on an ARM Cortex-A53 and was shown to consume half of the processor's instructions compared to the conventional implementation. The effect of applying MTD on the number of processor's instructions is evaluated and shown to be bounded.},   keywords={cryptography;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Internet of Things;security threats;cybersecurity;m-Health IoT security;novel security framework;healthcare services;emergency cases;m-Health services;networked services;LED bitslice implementation;m-Health IoT systems;conventional implementation;LED bitsliced implementation;bitslicing;practical implementation;cryptographic keys;m-Health system;MTD;Encryption;Logic gates;Light emitting diodes;Performance evaluation;Internet},   doi={10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326298},   ISSN={2158-4001},   month={Jan},}

Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features.

However, it includes a huge number of communicating nodes exchanging sensitive data, which rises both security and privacy challenges. Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a promising future network architecture, dealing with such challenges. It fits perfectly with all IoT applications and specifically E-health. In addition, it supports natively several security and privacy aspects. In this paper, we propose a pioneering privacy preserving E-health solution over NDN. This solution ensures security and achieves all privacy requirements. It relies mainly on the improvement and the adaptation of an existing privacy attempt for NDN, named ANDāNA.

A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm.

Real time monitoring for analyzing vital signs to early detect or predict life threatening adverse events and frequent checks if the prescribed medicine is taken in time or not is required. In the existing system there is a need of another person for monitoring the patient condition. The proposed system eliminates the need of such manual observation of the patient. This system mainly consists of three components iMed box, iMed pack, Bio_patch which plays an important role. The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position. GSM is used to send and receive the information from the Doctor.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={826-834},   abstract={There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented.

Unfortunately, a few proposals for testing these complex, and often safety-critical, systems are present in the literature. The authors propose an approach for acceptance testing of IoT systems adopting graphical user interfaces as a principal way of interaction. Acceptance testing is a type of black box testing based on test scenarios, i.e. sequences of steps/actions performed by the user or the system. In their approach, test scenarios are derived from a state machine that expresses the behaviour of the system under test, and test cases are derived from them by specifying the actual data and assertions and made executable by implementing the corresponding test scripts. As a case study, they selected a mobile health IoT system for diabetes management composed of local sensors/actuators, smartphones, and a remote cloud-based system. The effectiveness of the approach has been evaluated by measuring the capability of two test suites implemented using different localisation strategies (visual and structure-based) in detecting mutants of the original m-health system. Results show the effectiveness of the test suites implemented by following the proposed approach since 93% of the generated mutants have been detected.},   keywords={cloud computing;graphical user interfaces;Internet of Things;program testing;original m-health system;test suites;mobile health IoT system;corresponding test scripts;test cases;test scenarios;black box testing;graphical user interfaces;IoT systems;things systems;acceptance testing approach},   doi={10.1049/iet-sen.2017.0344},   ISSN={1751-8806},   month={},}

Thus, designing efficient transceivers is crucial to reduce transmission delay and energy through leveraging data reduction techniques. In this context, we propose an efficient data-specific transceiver design that leverages the inherent characteristics of the generated data at the physical layer to reduce transmitted data size without significant overheads. The goal is to adaptively reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted in order to efficiently communicate and possibly store information, while maintaining the required application Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.

 title={Session Resumption-Based End-to-End Security for Healthcare Internet-of-Things}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={581-588},   abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;end-to-end security;healthcare Internet-of-Things;IoT;smart gateways;DTLS session resumption technique;remote end-users;security context;session resumption technique;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;energy performance evaluations;remote patient monitoring prototype;Conferences;Computers;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing},   doi={10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={206-211},   abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},   keywords={cardiology;cardiovascular system;diseases;electroencephalography;Haar transforms;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;time series;individual physiological time series;biosignal processing system;Haar Transform;IoT application;Internet of Things;blood pressure;heart rate;EEG;chronic diseases;urgent diseases;cardiovascular disease;Time series analysis;Transforms;Correlation;Physiology;Medical services;Market research;Euclidean distance;time series;correlation;Haar wavelet;Haar transform;distance measure;clustering;healthcare;IoT},   doi={10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54},   ISSN={2471-7819},   month={Oct},}

The rapid development of IoT and vast expansion of wireless technologies unfold the new chances of growth in several domains such as, Education, Transportation, Agriculture, and especially in the Healthcare sector. Introducing the IoT through healthcare applications fetch several benefits, including cost savings through lowered hospital visiting costs, health care provider costs, transportation costs, human resource costs and the insurance costs. It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT. There is a great need to design and develop a lightweight secure authentication model, which offers significant security level against multiple attacks such as mainly: Impersonation attacks, man in the middle attack and unknown key sharing attacks for IoT base E-health domain.

Most embedded systems utilize software-based security mechanisms such as right management or cryptography, nevertheless they can be easily defeated by hardware attacks if no specific care is given during the development of the software. Consequently, it is necessary to provide software developers with efficient tools to assist in designing robust embedded systems against hardware security threats.

Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system.

To combat against these vulnerabilities, there is need to create an awareness of the potential risks of these devices and effective strategies are needed to be implemented to achieve a level of security defense. In this paper, the benefits of healthcare IoT system and the possible vulnerabilities that may result are presented. Also, we propose to develop solutions against these vulnerabilities by protecting mobile applications using obfuscation and return oriented programming techniques. These techniques convert an application into a form which makes difficult for an adversary to interpret or alter the code for illegitimate purpose.

In this paper, we studied the health situation of the elderly and proposed the Smart Healthcare system. It consists of a bio-signal measuring prototype (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) and a web application for both doctors and the elderly. It also includes an alert button. Evaluation was performed in two parts, which were qualitative interviewing and quantitative survey. We interviewed three doctors for confirmation regarding their opinion of the system (i.e. usefulness, visualizing data, and suggestions). Doctors replied that the system is useful for the elderly who are unaware of their own health information; consequently, they may unable to control their own health. For visualizing data, doctors normally view the measured data in number format. For displaying result to the elderly, it should be explained in simple statements that are easy to understand or described using color. Moreover, provision of an alert button is a valuable idea for saving lives. For the quantitative survey, we used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the core model to measure the acceptance by the elderly. Thirty 60-80-year-old elderly people participated in the survey.

In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},   keywords={biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;Internet of Things;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;Analog Signal compression;multiplexing technique;traffic data;IoT applications;power consumption;IoT devices;encoding method;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;analog domain;AJSCC device;analog encoding;FPMM receiver;joint modulation;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;multisignal compression method;FPMM technique;healthcare Internet of Things;IoT scalability;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;power saving;SNR operating region;miss detection rate;mean square error;Medical services;Sensors;Power demand;Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Shannon Mapping;Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.62},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

The aim of this project is to use the IoT with an intelligent wireless sensors network in order to monitor the health of plants and to observe the population of larva in a remote crop field. In this framework, a wireless sensors network is proposed to detect larva and measure other system parameters like Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), temperature, humidity and soil moisture. The sensors' data is collected by the front end sensing node, developed with a STM32F407VG board, via a serial port. The STM32F407VG board is based on the ARM processor. The data from the node is transmitted to a base station by using a wireless ZigBee interface. The base station collects data from a group of sensor nodes. This data is transmitted to the Central Processing Unit (CPU) via the USB liaison between the base station and the CPU. On CPU this data is analyzed via the MATLAB based specifically developed application. The findings are displayed and stored on the CPU and are also logged on the cloud via Thingspeak liaison.

 title={An IoT-based smart pillow for sleep quality monitoring in AAL environments}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={175-180},   abstract={Millions of people suffer from some way of sleep disorder. As a result, their quality of sleep decreases dramatically affecting not only their sleep but also the quality of their day to day life. Waiting lists for receiving a professional diagnose can be very long leaving the patient unable to take precautions to improve their sleep quality. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based sleep quality monitoring pillow that tracks temperature, humidity, luminosity, sound, and vibration. The pillow is able to forward the gathered information to a server through a wireless router with a static NAT configuration. Subsequently, user and medical staff can obtain the information and determine their quality of sleep. Furthermore, they are able to change the actions performed by the AAL system and the respective thresholds of the cushion. Architecture and algorithm of the system list circumstances that can reduce sleep quality and the actions intelligent devices perform to improve the sleep quality of the user. The paper shows the code for data acquisition and pertinent calibration of all sensors.},   keywords={biomedical communication;data acquisition;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical disorders;patient monitoring;sleep;wireless sensor networks;IoT;smart pillow;sleep disorder;sleep quality monitoring pillow;AAL environments;wireless router;static NAT configuration;data acquisition;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks;Biomedical monitoring;sleep quality;e-health;IoT;WSN;AAL;smart pillow;sleep disorders},   doi={10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364061},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={165-170},   abstract={The fast and wide advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) boosted by the remarkable development of sensor networks, RFID, software platforms and the Internet as a global container of IoT, have opened the appetite of several vertical industries to include IoT in their strategic vision for the coming years. Academic institutions have also established projects to vigorously investigate the potential of IoT and develop new protocols in all layers to suit IoT applications and/or adapt the current IP protocols to suit it. Some organizations have already implemented IoT and others have plans to implement it according to Gartner Inc. study. Healthcare industry is no exception, have already adopted IoT, and are planning to use it extensively in the following years for the benefits of patients, elderly people and caregivers. In this research paper, we develop a system architecture to manage IoT for the smart healthcare. For IoT in healthcare to succeed, it should be reliable, effective, well performing, secure and profitable for caregivers. This will guarantee continued operation and service delivery for patients and elderly to avoid any health risks.},   keywords={geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;Internet of things network management system;smart healthcare;IoT;sensor network;RFID;elderly people;caregiver;health risk;Logic gates;Internet;Performance evaluation;Switches;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Smart healthcare;Internet of Things;Smart healthcare network management;Smart healthcare contexts;Smart healthcare remote monitoring},   doi={10.1109/DICTAP.2016.7544021},   ISSN={},   month={July},}
