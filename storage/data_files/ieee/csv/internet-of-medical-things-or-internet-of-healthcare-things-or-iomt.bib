 title={Functional Assessment of Stenotic Coronary Artery in 3D Geometric Reconstruction From Fusion of Intravascular Ultrasound and X-Ray Angiography}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={53330-53341},   abstract={We aimed to present an alternative method for calculating fractional flow reserve (FFR) from 3-D reconstruction of a coronary artery, based on coronary (X-ray) angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), to evaluate the ischemic-risk of stenosis and the relationship between FFR and geometrical features of the coronary lesion. The reconstruction of the 3-D catheter trajectory was obtained by the vertical intersection of spatial surfaces which were derived from the 2-D catheter curves in the angiography plane. Computational fluid dynamics was applied to calculate the hemodynamics in the coronary arteries and coronary flow-based FFR (fFFR) was obtained. Twenty-two stenotic coronary arteries were included in this paper for the evaluation of the proposed method. Good correlation between fFFR and the measured pressure wire-derived FFR was found (<italic>F</italic>= 0.916 and<italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.01). Based on our computer modeling, the fFFR values correlated negatively with the severity of the stenosis (<italic>r</italic>= −0.784 and<italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.01). However, fFFR had no significant correlation with coronary curvature, lesion length, and angle. Our method therefore provides a coronary vascular model-based means for computing FFR, and makes full use of the advantages of IVUS examination to diagnose the diseases.},   keywords={Arteries;Catheters;Angiography;Image reconstruction;Ultrasonic imaging;Lesions;Solid modeling;Coronary angiography;intravascular ultrasound;3-D reconstruction;fractional flow reserve (FFR);computational fluid dynamics (CFD);TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction)},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870950},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={16},   number={2},   pages={367-380},   abstract={Biomedical systems of miniaturized implantable sensors and actuators interconnected in an intra-body area network could enable revolutionary clinical applications. Given the well-understood limitations of radio frequency (RF) propagation in the human body, in our previous work we investigated the use of ultrasonic waves as an alternative physical carrier of information, and proposed Ultrasonic WideBand (UsWB), an ultrasonic multipath-resilient integrated physical and medium access control (MAC) layer protocol. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a software-defined testbed architecture for ultrasonic intra-body area networks, and propose the first experimental demonstration of the feasibility of ultrasonic communications in tissue mimicking materials. We first discuss in detail our FPGA-based prototype implementation of UsWB. We then demonstrate how the prototype can flexibly trade performance off for power consumption, and achieve, for bit error rates (BER) no higher than 10-6, either (i) high-data rate transmissions up to 700 kbit/s at a transmit power of -14 dBm (≈ 40 μW), or (ii) low-data rate and lower-power transmissions down to -21 dBm (≈ 8 μW) at 70 kbit/s. We demonstrate that the UsWB MAC protocol allows multiple transmitter-receiver pairs to coexist and dynamically adapt the transmission rate according to channel and interference conditions to maximize throughput while satisfying predefined reliability constraints. We also show how UsWB can be used to enable a video monitoring medical application for implantable devices. Finally, we propose (and validate through experiments) a statistical model of small-scale fading for the ultrasonic intra-body channel.},   keywords={access protocols;biomedical materials;biomedical ultrasonics;body sensor networks;ultrasonic propagation;small-scale fading;statistical model;implantable devices;video monitoring medical application;FPGA-based prototype implementation;tissue mimicking materials;ultrasonic communications;software-defined testbed architecture;medium access control layer protocol;Ultrasonic WideBand;ultrasonic waves;radio frequency propagation;intrabody area network;actuators;miniaturized implantable sensors;biomedical systems;implantable biomedical devices;impulsive ultrasonic intrabody communications;experimental evaluation;Acoustics;Radio frequency;Media Access Protocol;Attenuation;Monitoring;Implants;Wireless communication;Body area networks;body sensor networks;implantable medical devices;Internet of medical things;ultrasonic communications and networking;acoustic communications and networking},   doi={10.1109/TMC.2016.2561277},   ISSN={1536-1233},   month={Feb},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={25399-25410},   abstract={Epilepsy is a health problem that seriously affects the quality of humans for many years. Therefore, it is important to accurately analyze and recognize epilepsy based on EEG signals, and for a long time, researchers have attempted to extract new features from the signals for epilepsy recognition. However, it is very difficult to select useful features from a large number of them in this diagnostic application. As the development of artificial intelligence progresses, unsupervised feature learning based on the deep learning model can obtain features that can better describe identified objects from unlabeled data. In this paper, the deep convolution network and autoencoders-based model, named as AE-CDNN, is constructed in order to perform unsupervised feature learning from EEG in epilepsy. We extract features by AE-CDNN model and classify the features based on two public EEG data sets. Experimental results showed that the classification results of features obtained by AE-CDNN are more optimal than features obtained by principal component analysis and sparse random projection. Using several common classifiers to classify features obtained by AE-CDNN model results in high accuracy and not inferior to the research results from most recent studies. The results also showed that the features of AE-CDNN model are clear, effective, and easy to learn. These features can speed up the convergence and reduce the training times of classifiers. Therefore, the AE-CDNN model can be effectively applied to feature extraction of EEG in epilepsy.},   keywords={convergence;diseases;electroencephalography;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;principal component analysis;random processes;signal classification;unsupervised learning;AE-CDNN model;artificial intelligence;autoencoders-based model;feature classification;principal component analysis;sparse random projection;convergence;feature extraction;epilepsy recognition;EEG signals;unsupervised feature learning;deep convolution network;deep learning model;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Convolution;Epilepsy;Training;Deconvolution;EEG;unsupervised learning;feature extraction;CNN;epileptic seizure},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2833746},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This algorithm uses the original sampling data obtained from the data acquisition card to simultaneously calculate the transmission spectrum of the F-P etalon (FPE) and the reflection spectrum of the fiber Bragg grating (FPG) sensors. In each scanning cycle, the transmission spectrum wavelength of the F-P etalon (FPE) is calibrated dynamically in real time, the reflectance spectrum central wavelength of the FPE sensors is calculated by referring to the transmission spectrum wavelength of the FPE that has been calibrated. It effectively weakens the perturbation effect caused by the nonlinear and non-reproducibility of narrowband light source from the fiber FPT filter, reduces the numerical error and effectively eliminates the pseudo peak of the FPE, and greatly improves the measurement accuracy of the system.

Because the applications will exchange enormous multimedia streams between remote sites, we propose a novel IoMT system architecture composed of several channel types that consist of various resource and network components. Users can dynamically incorporate these channels into applications to update the IoMT system’s effects.

Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Latin America;geographical coverage;physical health stands;Latin American healthcare systems;Latin American governments;wearable technology adoption;healthcare wearable technology challenges;Internet of Medical Things;IoMT;healthcare wearable technology;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Government;Security;Public healthcare;Real-time systems;healthcare;wearable;IoMT;Latin-America;adoption;barriers;challenges},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399181},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Secondly, we are going to present the representation of detected hand contours based on Bézier curve as metadata to provide an interoperable interface between a detection module and a recognition module in an IoMT framework. In addition, the comparison with existing standard tools that can be used for hand gesture representation is given. In the recognition module, the detected hand contour is reconstructed by parsing delivered metadata. A set of hand gestures featured with diverse combination of open fingers and rotational angles is used for the hand gesture recognition in the proposed recognition method.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={18592-18601},   abstract={Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Several computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to help reduce lung cancer mortality rates. This paper presents a novel structural co-occurrence matrix (SCM)-based approach to classify nodules into malignant or benign nodules and also into their malignancy levels. The SCM technique was applied to extract features from images of nodules and classifying them into malignant or benign nodules and also into their malignancy levels. The computed tomography exams from the lung image database consortium and image database resource initiative datasets provide information concerning nodule positions and their malignancy levels. The SCM was applied on both grayscale and Hounsfield unit images with four filters, to wit, mean, Laplace, Gaussian, and Sobel filters creating eight different configurations. The classification stage used three well-known classifiers: multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors algorithm and applied them to two tasks: (i) to classify the nodule images into malignant or benign nodules and (ii) to classify the lung nodules into malignancy levels (1 to 5). The results of this approach were compared to four other feature extraction methods: gray-level co-occurrence matrix, local binary patterns, central moments, and statistical moments. Moreover, the results here were also compared to the results reported in the literature. Our approach outperformed the other methods in both tasks; it achieved 96.7% for both accuracy and F-Score metrics in the first task, and 74.5% accuracy and 53.2% F-Score in the second.

At last, we perform a comparative experiment on the expansion of the Cohn-Kanade (CK +) facial expression data set and the test data sets collected from ten volunteers.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={53254-53264},   abstract={As a new intelligent manufacturing model, the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IOMT) based on the Internet of Things technology has a large amount of random, fuzzy, and uncertain information, which makes the optimization of manufacturing services face challenges. On the basis of fully considering the uncertain factors in the process of manufacturing service, a quality of service (QoS) optimization method based on mixed information axioms is proposed to solve the optimization problem of manufacturing service in the IOMT environment. The mixed uncertainty model is expounded with random variables to express the range of system and fuzzy variables to describe the design range. In order to select the best resource or sort, the fuzzy mathematics and the axiomatic theory of axiomatic design theory are combined to evaluate the coexistence of ambiguity and randomness of the QoS. Finally, the process of treatment and optimization in practical application by taking the example of a hydraulic pump product seeking service through the civil aircraft IOMT service platform is described. This example is given out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the traditional information axiom method, and this method extends the application scope of traditional information axioms.},   keywords={Indexes;Manufacturing;Quality of service;Optimization;Uncertainty;Random variables;Internet of Things;IOMT;QoS;service selection;mixed information axiom;fuzzy mathematics},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871252},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

The things that we expect to connect to the Internet will consist of sensors, actuators with information processing and communication capabilities that will make themselves intelligent.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={44944-44950},   abstract={There is a general agreement in the brain computer interface community that the feature extracting method called the common spatial pattern (CSP) combined with nonlinear classifiers can provide excellent results in some cases. However, CSP is also known to be very sensitive to noise and prone to over fitting, and the performance of this spatial filter is closely related to the operational frequency band of electroencephalogram data. To address this issue, we propose a new method FB-TRCSP+RF based on CSP and random forest. The FB-TRCSP is combined by the 8th-order Butterworth bandpass-filters and the CSP with Tikhonov regularization, which is a more robust feature extraction method compared to the CSP. Then, the model is applied to an experimental data set collected from 14 subjects and is compared with the non-regularization method FB-CSP+RF. The results show that the method we proposed yields relatively higher median classification accuracies and shows a stronger ability in subject-to-subject learning compared to prevailing approaches.},   keywords={Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Classification algorithms;Training;Forestry;Spatial filters;Covariance matrices;Classification;CSP;feature;FB-TRCSP+RF},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2860633},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

With the emergence of Internet of molecular things (IoMT), such nanomachine groups are now larger than ever. However, the minimal design of nanomachines makes cooperation difficult. In this paper, we investigate the performances of anarchic and cooperative transmitters in IoMT. We design an MC game in which nanomachines choose to cooperate or confront. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cooperation and state the possible transmitter personalities using game theoretic principles. Moreover, we focus on methods to ensure cooperation and we explore the optimal transmitter behavior if its partner rejects cooperation. Finally, we deduce that although ensuring cooperation may be done effectively with minimum hardware, anarchy is not necessarily a bad result. We also realize that in case a transmitter rejects cooperation, perpetual confrontation is not a good approach.},   keywords={cooperative communication;game theory;Internet of Things;molecular communication (telecommunication);radio transmitters;molecular communications;nanomachines;IoMT;nanomachine groups;anarchic transmitters;cooperative transmitters;state the possible transmitter personalities;ensuring cooperation;Internet of Molecular Things;MC game;game theoretic principles;Transmitters;Games;Molecular communication;Internet of Things;Nash equilibrium;Cooperative game;game theory;Nash equilibrium},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2709796},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

Seventy seven patients who underwent SBRT followed by 4DCT scans were incorporated in this retrospective study. The IGTV_DL was delineated using a novel deep machine learning algorithm with a linear exhaustive optimal combination framework. For the purpose of comparison, three other IGTVs based on common methods was also delineated. We compared the relative volume difference (RVI), matching index (MI), and encompassment index (EI) for the above IGTVs. Then, multiple parameter regression analysis was performed to assess the tumor volume and motion range as clinical influencing factors in the MI variation. The results demonstrated that the deep learning algorithm with linear exhaustive optimal combination framework has a higher probability of achieving optimal MI compared with other currently widely used methods. For patients after simple breathing training by keeping the respiratory frequency in 10 breath per minute (BPM), the four phase combinations of 0%, 30%, 50% and 90% can be considered as a potential solution for an optimal combination to synthesize IGTV in all respiration amplitudes.},   keywords={cancer;computerised tomography;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;pneumodynamics;regression analysis;tumours;deep learning algorithm;linear exhaustive optimal combination framework;optimal MI;internal gross target volume definition;lung cancer patients;internal gross target volume delineation;stereotactic body radiation therapy;SBRT;seventy seven patients;4DCT scans;retrospective study;IGTV_DL;deep machine learning algorithm;relative volume difference;multiple parameter regression analysis;tumor volume;motion range;4D computed tomography;simple breathing training;respiratory frequency;respiration amplitudes;phase combinations;Tumors;Lung;Training;Image segmentation;Computed tomography;Cancer;Machine learning;Deep learning;computed tomography;algorithm;stereotactic ablative radiotherapy;internal gross target volume;lung cancer},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2851027},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

There is no debate among security experts that the security of Internet-enabled medical devices is crucial, and an ongoing threat vector is insider attacks. In this paper, we focus on the identification of insider attacks in healthcare SDNs. Specifically, we survey stakeholders from 12 healthcare organizations (i.e., two hospitals and two clinics in Hong Kong, two hospitals and two clinics in Singapore, and two hospitals and two clinics in China). Based on the survey findings, we develop a trust-based approach based on Bayesian inference to figure out malicious devices in a healthcare environment.

While mobility enables innovative applications and allows new services, it remains a challenging issue as it causes disconnection of nodes and intermittent connectivity, which negatively impact the network performance; namely data loss, large handover delay and application functionality failures. In this paper, we propose a new energy efficient and mobility aware routing protocol named EC-MRPL based on the well-known Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL standard). Unlike RPL which is designed for low resources networks with basically static devices, the proposed protocol enables to better conserve the energy and sustain the connectivity of mobile nodes. EC-MRPL integrates an enhanced mobility detection method and a novel point of attachment prediction and replacement strategy aware of the resources constraints. As such, EC-MRPL overcomes and mitigates problems caused by mobility. Obtained simulation results using Cooja/Contiki show that EC-MRPL outperforms both the RPL and the MRPL protocols in terms of handover delay, data loss rate, signaling cost and energy consumption.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobility management (mobile radio);personal area networks;routing protocols;energy-efficient mobility support routing protocol;Internet of Mobile Things;IoMT;EC-MRPL;low-power lossy networks;RPL;static devices;enhanced mobility detection method;point of attachment prediction;replacement strategy;resource constraints;Cooja;handover delay;data loss rate;signaling cost;energy consumption;Contiki;Manganese;Routing protocols;Energy consumption;Handover;Delays;Internet of Mobile Things;6LoWPAN;Gross-layer design;Micro-Mobility support protocol;RPL},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983074},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

However, the current research and development activities have been restricted to scalar sensor data based IoT systems, thus leaving a gap to benefit from services and application enabled by `multimedia things' or Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). Moreover, a crucial issue for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) community is the steer increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which mandates green communication to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint emissions. Recently, IETF ROLL working group standardized an IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for resource constrained devices. RPL builds a tree-like network topology based on some network metric optimization using RPL Objective Functions. Previous RPL implementations for scalar sensor data communication are not feasible for IoMT, since multimedia traffic pose distinct network requirements. The goal of this paper is to design an enhanced version of RPL for IoMT in which the sensed information is essentially provided by the multimedia devices. Our proposed RPL implementation minimizes carbon footprint emissions and energy consumption, along with the incorporation of application specific Quality of Service requirements. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme a simulation study is carried out in Cooja simulator for Contiki-OS, which suggests significant gains in terms of energy efficiency and delay.},   keywords={Internet;IP networks;multimedia communication;optimisation;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;green routing protocol;Internet of Multimedia Things;ubiquitous connectivity;scalar sensor data;IoMT;Information and Communication Technology;ICT community;green communication;carbon footprint emissions;IPv6 routing protocol;network topology;network metric optimization;scalar sensor data communication;multimedia traffic;network requirements;Quality of Service requirements;Green products;Multimedia communication;Routing protocols;Air pollution;Carbon dioxide;Delays;Internet of Things;Multimedia sensors;Contiki;Green communication;Energy efficiency;RPL},   doi={10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106958},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS) -in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics -has always been the main challenge in designing such systems. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a five-layered heterogeneous mist, fog, and cloud based IoHT framework capable of efficiently handling and routing (near-)real-time as well as offline/batch mode data. Also, by employing software defined networking and link adaptation based load balancing, the framework ensures optimal resource allocation and efficient resource utilization. The results, obtained by simulating the framework, indicate that the designed network via its various components can achieve high QoS, with reduced end-to-end latency and packet drop rate, which is essential for developing next generation e-healthcare systems.},   keywords={Medical services;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Quality of service;Monitoring;Healthcare big data;healthcare application;data fusion;real-time computing;resource allocation;quality of service;load balancing.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876088},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Examples of mobile Smart Objects include vehicles of any kind, wearable devices, sensor tags, mobile robots, etc, anyhing with embedded sensors and/or actuators. In this context of general mobility of objects, mobile personal devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.) are well suited as the universal providers of Internet connectivity and location information for simpler smart objects that lack location sensors and have only short-range wireless interfaces. This paper describes Mobile Hub (M-Hub), a generic mobile middleware for IoMT, its design and prototype implementation for Android and Bluetooth. The Mobile Hub extends our previous mobile-cloud communication middleware SDDL, so that it is able to provide scalable and reliable mobile communication and data processing capabilities to mobile smart objects.

In this paper, we have developed a fully automatic approach to sequentially segment the carotid IM borders in each image throughout ultrasound sequences. First, the first frame of an ultrasound sequence is automatically segmented using edge detectors and dynamic programming, and then the rest frames are segmented successively under the state-space framework. Under this framework, we developed a variant of the snake method for a precise measurement. The evaluation of our segmentation result is done by comparison with average manual delineations of three physicians on a total of 65 sequences. The accuracy of our method is high.

 title={SAMS: A Seamless and Authorized Multimedia Streaming framework for WMSN-based IoMT}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={An Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) architecture aims to provide a support for real-time multimedia applications by using wireless multimedia sensor nodes that are deployed for long-term usage. These nodes are capable of capturing both multimedia and non-multimedia data, and form a network known as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN). In a WMSN, the underlying routing protocols need to provide an acceptable level of Quality-of-Service (QoS) support for the multimedia traffic. In this paper, we propose a seamless and authorized multimedia streaming framework (SAMS) for a cluster-based hierarchical WMSN. SAMS uses authentication at different levels to form secured clusters. The formation of these clusters allows only legitimate nodes to transmit captured data to their cluster heads. Each node senses the environment, stores captured data in its buffer, and waits for its turn to transmit to its cluster head. This waiting may result in an excessive packet loss and end-to-end delay for multimedia traffic. To address these issues, a channel allocation approach is proposed for inter-cluster communication. In case of buffer overflow, a member node in one cluster switches to a neighboring cluster head provided that the latter has an available channel for allocation. The experimental results show that SAMS provides an acceptable level of QoS and enhances the security of the underlying network.},   keywords={Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Authentication;Head;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;IoMT;WMSN;QoS;authentication;channel allocation;Inter/Intra cluster communication.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2848284},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

As such, automated methods for detecting and classifying the types of blood cells have important medical applications in this field. Although deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the traditional machine learning methods have shown good results in the classification of blood cell images, they are unable to fully exploit the long-term dependence relationship between certain key features of images and image labels. To resolve this problem, we have introduced the recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, we combined the CNN and RNN in order to propose the CNN-RNN framework that can deepen the understanding of image content and learn the structured features of images and to begin endto-end training of big data in medical image analysis. In particular, we apply the transfer learning method to transfer the weight parameters that were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to the CNN section and adopted a custom loss function to allow our network to train and converge faster and with more accurate weight parameters. Experimental results show that compared with the other CNN models such as ResNet and Inception V3, our proposed network model is more accurate and efficient in classifying blood cell images.},   keywords={blood;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;recurrent neural nets;important medical applications;deep convolutional neural network;traditional machine learning methods;blood cell images;long-term dependence relationship;image labels;recurrent neural networks;CNN-RNN framework;image content;medical image analysis;transfer learning method;CNN models;network model;recursive neural network;blood cell image classification;blood-related diseases;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Support vector machines;White blood cells;Image classification;Artificial intelligence;convolutional neural network;recurrent neural network;transfer learning},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846685},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Rapid popularization of portable and wearable devices in recent years makes widespread personalized and mobile healthcare get closer to reality than ever before. This paper presents a method aiming for automatic detection of AF from short single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Since AF is a kind of arrhythmia being likely to alter the dynamics of heart rhythms and/or the morphological characteristics in ECG tracings, heart rate variability (HRV)-based metrics and frequency analysis are adopted as feature extractors. We validate our method on a public available data set comprised of short ECG recordings of normal rhythm (N), AF (A), and other arrhythmias (O) by support vector machine and bagging trees. For two-class classification problems (N versus A), accuracy varies from 92.0% to 96.6% under different additional noise levels. For three-class classification problem (N versus A versus O), accuracy as high as 82.0% is obtained. Experimental results suggest than even for a relatively short ECG recording, nonlinear descriptors of HRV are still efficient and robust for AF detection.},   keywords={Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Feature extraction;Biomedical monitoring;Rail to rail inputs;Robustness;Atrial fibrillation;ECG;heart rate variability;biomedical signal processing;machine learning},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871220},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, there is still the issue of efficiency when HEVC encryption is applied in the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). Aiming at this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new low overhead HEVC encryption scheme for energy-constrained IoMT. Concretely, the proposed scheme adjusts the selection of the aforementioned syntax elements to be encrypted according to the structure, texture and motion energy present in each frame. It works as follows. The energy levels of quantized coefficients and motion vectors are calculated and compared with adaptive threshold values to classify the energy level in each video frame. When there is a high energy frame in the video, all the syntax elements are encrypted. When there is a low energy frame, alternate syntax elements are encrypted for achieving low encryption overhead. Moreover, in the case of transform coefficients, to withstand the interpolation attack, alternate coefficients are encrypted after correlating the frame with its neighboring coefficients. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently reduces the encryption overhead with low impact on the security level, making it suitable for IoMT.},   keywords={Encryption;Streaming media;Transforms;Multimedia communication;Syntactics;HEVC;Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT);Multimedia Security;Low Encryption Overhead},   doi={10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2808174},   ISSN={1051-8215},   month={},}

In this paper, we present a novel non-invasive monitoring system for fall detection in older people who live alone. Our proposal is using very-low-resolution thermal sensors for classifying a fall and then alerting to the care staff. Also, we analyze the performance of three recurrent neural networks for fall detections: long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit, and Bi-LSTM. As many learning algorithms, we have performed a training phase using different test subjects. After several tests, we can observe that the Bi-LSTM approach overcome the others techniques reaching a 93% of accuracy in fall detection. We believe that the bidirectional way of the Bi-LSTM algorithm gives excellent results because the use of their data is influenced by prior and new information, which compares to LSTM and GRU.

Some issues regarding future development of the IMedT system were presented including smart diagnosis capability, security issues, and extension to the 6LoPAN as well as its compliance to the emerging 5G mobile networks.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;phonocardiography;Internet of Medical Things;cardiac monitoring;5G mobile networks;medical care;health care;IoT deployment;phonocardiograph signal;PCG signal;data mirroring;IMedT system;smart diagnosis capability;security issues;Monitoring;Medical services;Heart;Phonocardiography;Bluetooth;5G mobile communication;Internet of Medical Things (IMedT);Internet of Things (IoT);cardiac monitoring;tele-auscultation;5G mobile networks},   doi={10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907420},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The collective name for interconnected sensors, placed on "things" within fixed cyber-physical infrastructures, is Internet of Things (IoT). IoT enables cities and rural areas to become smarter and to offer new digital services and functions to diverse groups of users. However, IoT often represents interconnection of static things, which are built-in into the physical infrastructures of users' homes, offices, roads and other physical and critical infrastructures. In this paper, we analyze things that are mobile, and explore the space of Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT). Mobility of digital devices such as phones and vehicles has been with us for some time, but as the number of sensors in mobile devices increases, the density of mobile devices increases, and users' reliance on mobile devices increases, mobile things become very much an integral fabric of our smart environment. In this paper, our goal is to discuss challenges, selective designs and implementations of IoMT. We show the impact of mobility and the care we collectively have to take when designing the next generation of smart environments with mobile things in them.},   keywords={cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Internet of Mobile Things;smart environments;smart grid;smart transportation;smart buildings;interconnected sensors;cyber-physical infrastructures;mobile devices;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Sensors;Data collection;Vehicles;Context;Security},   doi={10.1109/IoTDI.2015.41},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

 title={A Game Theoretic Optimization of RPL for Mobile Internet of Things Applications}, 
  year={2018},   volume={18},   number={6},   pages={2520-2530},   abstract={The presence of mobile nodes in any wireless network can affect the performance of the network, leading to higher packet loss and increased energy consumption. However, many recent applications require the support of mobility and an efficient approach to handle mobile nodes is essential. In this paper, a game scenario is formulated, where nodes compete for network resources in a selfish manner, to send their data packets to the sink node. Each node counts as a player in the non-cooperative game. The optimal solution for the game is found using the unique Nash equilibrium (NE), where a node cannot improve its pay-off function while other players use their current strategy. The proposed solution aims to present a strategy to control different parameters of mobile nodes (or static nodes in a mobile environment) including transmission rate, timers, and operation mode, in order to optimize the performance of routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) under mobility in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption, and end-to-end-delay. The proposed solution monitors the mobility of nodes based on received signal strength indication readings, and it also takes into account the priorities of different nodes and the current level of noise in order to select the preferred transmission rate. An optimized protocol called game-theory based mobile RPL (GTM-RPL) is implemented and tested in multiple scenarios with different network requirements for Internet of Things applications. Simulation results show that in the presence of mobility, GTM-RPL provides a flexible and an adaptable solution that improves throughput whilst maintaining lower energy consumption showing more than 10% improvement compared to related work. For applications with high throughput requirements, GTM-RPL shows a significant advantage with more than 16% improvement in throughput and 20% improvement in energy consumption.},   keywords={game theory;Internet of Things;mobile radio;routing protocols;game theoretic optimization;mobile nodes;wireless network;sink node;static nodes;mobile environment;lossy networks;GTM-RPL;Mobile Internet of Things Applications;game-theory based mobile RPL;Mobile nodes;Protocols;Measurement;Routing;Games;Routing;WSN;IoT;RPL;mobility;game theory;6LoWPAN;IoMT},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2018.2794762},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={March},}

In this space, challenges come from the needs to determine (1) contextual information such as location, duration of contact, density of devices, utilizing networked sensory information; (2) higher level knowledge such as users' activity detection, mood detection, applications usage pattern detection and user interactions on `mobile things', utilizing contextual information; and (3) adaptive and real-time parallel and distributed architectures that integrate context, activity, mood, usage patterns into mobile application services on mobile `things'.

First, we present a detection method that utilizes depth image obtained by incoming stereo image sequences and skin color information in a combined way. Secondly, we are going to present the representation of detected hand contours based on Bézier curve as metadata to provide an interoperable interface between a detection module and a recognition module in an IoMT framework. In addition, the comparison with existing standard tools that can be used for hand gesture representation is given. In the recognition module, the detected hand contour is reconstructed by parsing delivered metadata. A set of hand gestures featured with diverse combination of open fingers and rotational angles is used for the hand gesture recognition in the proposed recognition method. Finally, the recognized hand gesture is mapped into one of the pre-defined set of gesture commands.

Current solutions for stream data management in IoMT have been focused on partial aspects of a data life cycle process, with special emphasis on sensor networks. This paper aims to address this problem by developing streaming data life cycle process that incorporates an edge/fog/cloud architecture that is needed for handling heterogeneous, streaming and geographically-dispersed IoMT devices. We propose a 3-tier architecture to support an instant intra-layer communication that establishes a stream data flow in real-time to respond to immediate data life cycle tasks in the system. Communication and process are thus the defining factors in the design of our stream data management solution for IoMT.

We undertake test simulations (technology trial without patient subjects) to demonstrate potential of long-range analysis, using a disposable test `key' and companion Android app to form a diagnostic platform suitable for remote point-of-care screening for urinary tract infection (UTI). The 868 MHz LoRaWAN-enabled personalized monitor demonstrated sound potential with UTI test results being correctly diagnosed and transmitted to a remote secure cloud server in every case. Tests ranged over distances of 1.1-6.0 Km with radio path losses from 119-141 dB. All tests conducted were correctly and robustly received at the base station and relayed to the secure server for inspection. The UTI test strips were visually inspected for correct diagnosis based on color change and verified as 100% accurate. Results from testing across a number of regions indicate that such an Internet of Things medical solution is a robust and simple way to deliver next generation community-based smart diagnostics and disease management to best benefit patients and clinical staff alike. This significant step can be applied to any type of home or region, particularly those lacking suitable mobile signals, broadband connections, or even landlines.

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={8418-8441},   abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;middleware;distributed data collection protocol;IoHT devices;intensive privacy preserving processes;privacy regulation frameworks;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;concealment process;holistic privacy middleware;personal gateways;sensitive health information;cloud-based healthcare services;accountability act;health insurance portability;personal health information;privacy laws;healthcare data;healthcare provider;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;living organism;healthcare Web services;hospital setting;personalized health insights;health data;healthcare delivery;Internet of Healthcare Things;healthcare things;OECD privacy principles;automated compliance;fog based middleware;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data privacy;Data models;Logic gates;Privacy;Internet of things;Patient monitoring;Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={895-900},   abstract={In several use-cases of Internet of Things (IoT), IEEE 802.11 based WLANs are more favorable due to superior data rate support even though their energy efficiency is not up to the mark. Particularly, wireless multimedia sensors based WLANs demand higher energy resources. In this regard, various IEEE 802.11 based power saving mechanisms are developed. IEEE 802.11n standard specifies Power Save Multiple Poll (PSMP) protocol. However, PSMP is infeasible for many IoT based systems specifically in use-cases where multi-hop communication is required. Moreover, PSMP scheduling mechanism lacks the capability to adapt to the dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). In this paper, a QoS aware Multi-Hop PSMP (mPSMP) protocol is proposed to enable energy efficient multimedia communication over IoT. The mPSMP incorporate a traffic scheduling model to allocate channel resources in a time division multiple access manner.

 title={A Benchmark Database and Baseline Evaluation for Fall Detection Based on Wearable Sensors for the Internet of Medical Things Platform}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={51286-51296},   abstract={Falling is a common and dangerous event for the elderly population. Fall detection is an interesting scientific problem and an ill-defined process that can be solved through various methods. In this paper, various methods and detection algorithms based on wearable sensors are introduced. A benchmark database, namely, a fall detection database, is presented to evaluate the performance of detection algorithms. This database collects sample data from 26 males and 24 females performing 15 kinds of activities, including falls and activities of daily life, such as walking, running, and walking upstairs. The subjects comprise 50 males and females ranging from 21 to 60 years of age, 1.55 to 1.90 m in height, and 40 to 85 kg in weight. A full comparison between the existing databases and the proposed database is presented. Four baseline algorithms (the artificial neutral network, k nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and kernel Fisher discriminant) are used to evaluate the databases’ reliabilities. Evaluation protocols based on the fall detection database are discussed, and the performance of the four algorithms as a baseline are presented for the following objectives: 1) to elementarily assess the database through the fall detection algorithms; 2) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the common algorithms; and 3) to obtain the evaluation results for two classes and multiple classes based on the database. In hospitals, it is helpful to build a fall detection system for some patients who are unconscious and unable to call for help after falling down. Therefore, this paper has implications for the construction of a medical IOT platform.},   keywords={Databases;Legged locomotion;Wearable sensors;Acceleration;Detection algorithms;Magnetic sensors;Fall detection;wearable sensors;baseline evaluation;medical IOT platform},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869833},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={21418-21426},   abstract={Biometric systems have been actively emerging in various industries in the past few years and continue to provide higher-security features for access control systems. Many types of unimodal biometric systems have been developed. However, these systems are only capable of providing lowto mid-range security features. Thus, for higher-security features, the combination of two or more unimodal biometrics (multiple modalities) is required. In this paper, we propose a multimodal biometric system for person recognition using face, fingerprint, and finger vein images. Addressing this problem, we propose an efficient matching algorithm that is based on secondary calculation of the Fisher vector and uses three biometric modalities: face, fingerprint, and finger vein. The three modalities are combined and fusion is performed at the feature level. Furthermore, based on the method of feature fusion, the paper studies the fake feature which appears in the practical scene. The liveness detection is append to the system, detect the picture is real or fake based on DCT, then remove the fake picture to reduce the influence of accuracy rate, and increase the robust of system. The experimental results showed that the designed framework can achieve an excellent recognition rate and provide higher security than a unimodal biometric-based system, which are very important for a IoMT platform.},   keywords={authorisation;biometrics (access control);discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;image matching;Internet of Things;Internet of Medical Things;matching algorithm;DCT;liveness detection;unimodal biometric-based system;biometric modalities;finger vein images;fingerprint;multimodal biometric system;unimodal biometric systems;access control systems;higher-security features;IoMT platform;biometrics identification system;multimodal feature-level fusion;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Veins;Fingers;Face;Face recognition;Multi-model fusion;fisher vector;liveness detection;personal identification;IoMT},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2815540},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Recent works with Huntington's disease (HD) patients have reported results up to 88.2% of correct classification based on a probabilistic modeling approach for gait assessment. The aim of this paper was to improve HD patients' classification results while reducing the number of sensor devices to capture gait data and identifying the related gait features. The proposed method is based on general assembles (Meta) classifier algorithms' approach, for the classification of HD affected gait versus healthy control (HC) subjects normal gait. The proposed methodology was tested on gait data recorded on HD patients and HC subjects using raw data from smart-phones movement sensors placed at both ankles. Best partial results of individual classifier algorithms are taken at each iteration of the meta-classifier, to predict the final result by averaging results and majority votes. Several instances of this combined approach were tested and validated. Obtained results confirm an improvement in accuracy, since 13 subjects out of a total of 14 were correctly classified.

Collected data in such systems are highly critical and can be affected by wireless network conditions, which in return, motivates the need for a preprocessing stage that optimizes data delivery in an adaptive manner with respect to network dynamics. We present in this paper adaptive single and multiple modality data compression schemes based on deep learning approach, which consider acquired data characteristics and network dynamics for providing energy efficient data delivery. Results indicate that: 1) the proposed adaptive single modality compression scheme outperforms conventional compression methods by 13.24% and 43.75% reductions in distortion and processing time, respectively; 2) the proposed adaptive multiple modality compression further decreases the distortion by 3.71% and 72.37% when compared with the proposed single modality scheme and conventional methods through leveraging inter-modality correlations; and 3) adaptive multiple modality compression demonstrates its efficiency in terms of energy consumption, computational complexity, and responding to different network states. Hence, our approach is suitable for mobile health applications (mHealth), where the smart preprocessing of vital signs can enhance energy consumption, reduce storage, and cut down transmission delays to the mHealth cloud.},   keywords={data compression;diseases;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;patient monitoring;single modality scheme;adaptive multiple modality compression;energy consumption;mobile health applications;deep learning approach;vital signs compression;energy efficient delivery;mhealth systems;chronic disease patients;continuous health monitoring;health-care providers;scalable energy efficient mobile health systems;collected data;wireless network conditions;adaptive manner;network dynamics;multiple modality data compression schemes;data characteristics;energy efficient data delivery;adaptive single modality compression scheme;network states;data delivery;inter-modality correlations;smart preprocessing;Electroencephalography;Image coding;Machine learning;Adaptive systems;Data compression;Correlation;Energy consumption;WBASN;multiple modality data;compression;deep learning;cross-layer optimization},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844308},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative, sometimes revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications that can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implantable and wearable devices. We show that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power and mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers the gap in attenuation between 2.4 GHz RF and ultrasonic waves is still substantial, e.g., ultrasounds offer 70 dB less attenuation over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires much lower transmission power compared to 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability in tissues, e.g., 35 dBm lower over 12 cm for 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; Bit Error Rate (BEr) leading to lower energy per bit and longer device lifetime. Finally, we show experimentally that 2.4 GHz RF links are not functional at all above 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; up to 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.},   keywords={biomedical communication;biomedical ultrasonics;error statistics;Internet of Things;low-power electronics;prosthetics;ultrasonic transducers;low-power ultrasonic platform;wirelessly networked systems;implantable medical devices;sensors;actuators;revolutionary therapies;networked implantable devices;dielectric nature;human body;radio-frequency electromagnetic waves;software architecture;ultrasonic connectivity;wearable devices;ultrasonic waves;mm-sized components;ultrasonic transducers the gap;attenuation;IoMT platform;lower transmission power;longer device lifetime;ultrasonic links;intrabody communications;RF links;transmission power;Internet of Medical Things platform;frequency 2.4 GHz;noise figure 70.0 dB;size 10.0 cm;size 12.0 cm;size 20.0 cm;Acoustics;Radio frequency;Sensors;Implants;Hardware;Wireless communication;Field programmable gate arrays},   doi={10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057133},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

First, more than 7000 diseases were obtained, and we collected the recommended food and taboo food for each disease. Then, referring to the<italic>China Food Nutrition</italic>, we used noise intensity and information entropy to find out which nutritional ingredients can exert positive effects on diseases. Finally, we proposed an improved algorithm named CVNDA_Red based on rough sets to select the corresponding core ingredients from the positive nutritional ingredients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to discuss the relationship between nutritional ingredients in food and diseases through data mining based on rough set theory in China. The experiments on real-life data show that our method based on data mining improves the performance compared with the traditional statistical approach, with the precision of 1.682. In addition, for some common diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, our work is able to identify correctly the first two or three nutritional ingredients in food that can benefit the rehabilitation of those diseases.

Due to the increase of multimedia IoT devices (i.e. traffic camera), the types of events created are shifting more toward unstructured (multimedia) data. Therefore, there is a growing demand for efficient utilization of effective processing of streams of both structured events (i.e. sensors) and unstructured multimedia events (i.e. images, video, and audio). However, current event processing engines have limited or no support for unstructured event types. In this paper, we described a generalized approach that can handle Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) events as a native event type in event processing engines with high efficiency. The proposed system extends event processing languages with the introduction of operators for multimedia analysis of unstructured events and leverages a deep convolutional neural network based event matcher for processing image events to extract features. Furthermore, we show that neural network based object detection models can be further optimized by leveraging subscription constraints to reduce time complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of a generalized approach toward IoMT-based event processing. Application areas for generalized event processing include traffic management, security, parking, and supervision activities to enhance the quality of life within smart cities.},   keywords={feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);middleware;object detection;statistical analysis;IoMT-based event processing;Internet of Multimedia Things events;deep convolutional neural network based event matcher;unstructured multimedia events;structured events;multimedia IoT devices;deep neural network based event processing;generalized event processing;neural network based object detection models;image events;multimedia analysis;event processing languages;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Sensors;Smart cities;Internet of Multimedia Things;Smart Cities;Event-Based Systems;Internet of Things;Multimedia Stream Processing;Distributed Systems;Smart Environments},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823590},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Consequently, a large number of TCM formulae with different therapeutic effects have been accumulated in IoMT. Therefore, we presented PWFP, which is an efficient methodology for extracting the top-K weighted frequent patterns for IoMT. PWFP guarantees efficient mining performance by estimating the minimum weighted support threshold value. Furthermore, PWFP can be applied in the efficacy-based analysis of these TCM formulae. This study conducted several experiments on both general datasets and TCM formulae for glomerulonephritis stored in IoMT.

Considering the efficiency performance, the privacy protection is often kept at a lower level in order to ensure the application can offer a higher level performance. However, this mechanism also causes a serious concern of privacy hazards due to the information over collections operated by apps/applications. Addressing this privacy issue, this paper proposes an approach that is designed to provide high-level privacy protection without lowering down the efficiency in cloud/fog computing (especially in biological systems of IoMT). The proposed model is called fog-based access control model. The fine-grained data access control is combined with the implementation of fog computing in the proposed approach.
