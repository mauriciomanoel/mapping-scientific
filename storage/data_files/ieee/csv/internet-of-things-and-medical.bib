 title={Automatic Ocular Disease Screening and Monitoring Using a Hybrid Cloud System}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={263-268},   abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;image classification;Internet of Things;medical image processing;hybrid cloud system;healthcare IT systems;advanced image and data analysis techniques;medical devices;cloud-based system;advanced pattern classification algorithms;ophthalmologists;disease detection;ocular disease screening;Diseases;Cloud computing;Retina;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Internet of Things;healthcare;ocular diseases;disease screening;computer aided diagnosis;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.68},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;software defined networking;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;health monitoring systems;Internet of Things;e-healthcare sensor network load-balancing scheme;hospital remote-monitoring network planning;SDN-SFC;load-balancing mechanism;network congestion;hospital networks;relaying real-time information;remote medical sensors;Conferences;IEC;IEC Standards;Noise measurement;Cloud e-Healthcare;Wireless Body Area Network;Software-Defined Networking},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210833},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

This paper focuses on improvement of contrast, brightness and noise reduction of dental CBCT images by using Bi Histogram Equalization technique with bent activation function and adaptive median filter for noise reduction. The output image has been analyzed and evaluated using peak value ratio in term of Signal versus Noise (PSNR) and matrix of Structure in term of Similarity Index (SSIM).

 title={Ultra-Low Power, Secure IoT Platform for Predicting Cardiovascular Diseases}, 
  year={2017},   volume={64},   number={9},   pages={2624-2637},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the health-care sector through remote, continuous, and non-invasive monitoring of patients. However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.},   keywords={application specific integrated circuits;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;power aware computing;power consumption;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;cardiovascular diseases;Internet-of-Things;health-care sector;noninvasive patient monitoring;IoT-enabled medical devices;low-power ECG-processors;ultralow power;secure IoT sensing-preprocessing platform;ventricular arrhythmia;ECG signals;application specific integrated circuits;low power enhanced technology;chip-specific ECG;communication channel;thwarting hardware security;on-chip resources;multilayered security infrastructure;design-for-trust solution;Electrocardiography;Security;Hardware;Reverse engineering;System-on-chip;Integrated circuit modeling;ECG;biomedical classifier;ventricular arrythmia;Internet of Things;hardware security;design-for-trust},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2017.2694968},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={Sept},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={335-341},   abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback. This data, which pertains to bicortical drilling conditions, will provide teaching surgeons and their surgical residents evaluation tools beyond those currently available.},   keywords={biological tissues;biomedical education;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;surgery;Internet-of-Things;biomedical development;surgery;healthcare professional training;hard tissues;soft tissues;medical instruments;program insurance;bicortical drilling conditions;Surgery;Hardware;Training;Software;Fixtures;Research and development management;Conferences;Biomedical;Surgical Training;Femoral Surgery;Bicortical;Internet of Things;Model-Driven Development;Software Engineering;Hardware Engineering;Systems Engineering;Cognitive Computing},   doi={10.1109/TEMSCON.2017.7998399},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, this has become a bottleneck in recent years since an extreme amount of heterogeneous items have to be recorded and traced with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. In a typical application of process synthesis management, each item will be involved with multiple processes but when those processes are interconnected, an extremely complex network emerges and has to be managed. Existing works on processing management systems, however, are always case-based and only focus on specific application domains. Thus, the general applied processing management model is rather limited. In this paper, we summarize the characteristics of the RFID application domains, and by abstraction, we propose an innovation of the RFID processing model. In this model, each RFID data were deemed as an operation record and all their processing services are logically interconnected and organized as a procedure graph. In addition, we abstract and summarize the basic RFID data processes into a few types. The advantage of this design is that the basic RFID data processing logic can be preprogrammed and in a real domain, the system can be dynamically programmed by automatically constructing the procedure graph nodes with those basic processes and mapping the interconnection logic according to the topology of the graph. As the last part of this paper, we designed a prototype system for medical instruments infection control to demonstrate our approach.},   keywords={data communication;graph theory;radiofrequency identification;procedure graph model;automatic RFID data processing service management;process management;radio frequency identification;process synthesis management;procedure graph;medical instruments;Data models;Data processing;RFID tags;Instruments;Internet of Things;Logic gates;Data integrity validation;distributed query processing;process modeling theory;radio frequency identification (RFID)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2661326},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

VLC technology has emerged as an alternative wireless communication due to various advantages such as ubiquity, low energy consumption, no radio frequency (RF) radiation, and security against undesired network access. Significant bio-medical signal including the electrocardiography (ECG) can be transferred with VLC even in places where RF is forbidden. This potential advantage of VLC could save more emergency patients. The time hopping scheme is adopted to transmit multiple medical data with keeping a simple system design. Multiple data streams go through an optical detector including a photodiode and multiple data are separated by TH demodulator at the receiver. Each separated signal is then monitored to serve the necessary medical care for the concerned patient.},   keywords={demodulation;electrocardiography;free-space optical communication;indoor communication;optical receivers;patient care;photodiodes;time hopping-based visible light communication;TH VLC system;electromagnetic wave free indoor healthcare;biomedical signal;electrocardiography;ECG;emergency patient saving;multiple medical data transmission;optical detector;photodiode;TH demodulator;medical care;Monitoring;Data communication;Medical services;Electrocardiography;Optical transmitters;Light emitting diodes;Receivers;Indoor Healthcare;Time hopping (TH);Visible Light Communication (VLC);light emitting diode (LED);BioMedical Signal},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845438},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Recent scientific works were mainly aimed at personalizing treatments, according to the patient’s clinical conditions. On the contrary, this scientific work aims propose an alternative approach based on big data analytics coming from the sensors of robotic rehabilitation devices in order to improve the patient’s therapy in the perspective of a healthcare Cloud of Things (CoT) scenario. We perform an exploratory analysis considering big data coming from sensors installed in Lokomat, i.e., one of the major robotic rehabilitation devices, in order to study the data model and the predictors that will allow clinical operators to forecast the best treatment personalizing the therapy. Data analysis proves that there are moderate correlations among features referring to stance and swing biofeedbacks of hip and knee. From the analytical point of view, these values may approximate the stance and swing phases of knee and hip. This can be compared with the normal gait pattern of healthy individuals, so as to point out those patients having a closer normal ambulation.

As an effective method, with analyzing the structure of a propagation network, a large number of previous studies have analyzed the propagation dynamics. Most of these studies are based on a special network structure to make such analysis. However, a propagation network has dynamically changed structure during the propagation. How to track, recognize and model such dynamic change is a big challenge. Along with the popularity of smart devices and the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive mobile data is automatically collected. In this article, as a typical use case, we investigate the impact of network structure on epidemic propagation dynamics by analyzing the massive mobile data collected from smart devices carried by the volunteers of Ebola outbreak areas. From this investigation, we obtain two observations. Based on these observations and the analytical ability of Apache Spark on streaming data and graphs, we propose a simple model to track and recognize the dynamic structure of a network.

  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={1},   pages={14-22},   abstract={Multipath routing in wireless multimedia sensor network makes it possible to transfer data simultaneously so as to reduce delay and congestion and it is worth researching. However, the current multipath routing strategy may cause problem that the node energy near sink becomes obviously higher than other nodes which makes the network invalid and dead. It also has serious impact on the performance of wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). In this paper, we propose a pair-wise directional geographical routing (PWDGR) strategy to solve the energy bottleneck problem. First, the source node can send the data to the pair-wise node around the sink node in accordance with certain algorithm and then it will send the data to the sink node. These pair-wise nodes are equally selected in 360° scope around sink according to a certain algorithm. Therefore, it can effectively relieve the serious energy burden around Sink and also make a balance between energy consumption and end-to-end delay. Theoretical analysis and a lot of simulation experiments on PWDGR have been done and the results indicate that PWDGR is superior to the proposed strategies of the similar strategies both in the view of the theory and the results of those simulation experiments. With respect to the strategies of the same kind, PWDGR is able to prolong 70% network life. The delay time is also measured and it is only increased by 8.1% compared with the similar strategies.},   keywords={telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks;PWDGR;pair-wise directional geographical routing strategy;wireless multimedia sensor network;multipath routing strategy;WMSN;pair-wise node;Routing;Energy consumption;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Internet of Things;Intelligent sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Geography;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Medical devices;Wireless Multi-media Sensor Network;Directional Geographical Routing;QoS;Energy Hole;Directional geographical routing;energy hole;quality of service (QoS);wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2367116},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

We use the well-known mathematical convolution for the segments of the network. This methodology is applied using the simple definition of efficiency per segment. The first segment assumes the communication between nanosensor and intra-body device, whereas in the second one the intra-body device is engaged to the bio-cyber interface through the THz band. Others segments belong to the macroscopic scale but working in the MHz band. When the full QoS is estimated and assuming the most optimistic scenario, our crude estimation for the concrete case applied to nanomedicine has turned out to to be of order of 85%. In the other side, the lowest values of QoS would yield numbers below 50% by which the network might be running in those scenarios where traffic in cloud might degrade the IoBNT substantially.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cloud computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;nanosensors;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks;QoS;IoBNT;mathematical convolution;quality of service;Internet of Bio-Nano Things;intrabody device;biocyber interface;nanosensor;Quality of service;Convolution;Kidney;Nanoscale devices;Estimation;Nanomedicine;QoS;IoBNT;THz-emission},   doi={10.1109/INTERCON.2017.8079655},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={133-142},   abstract={Technology advancements as well as the Internet-of-Things paradigm enable the design of wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems. Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;ultralow-power design;battery-operated wearable devices;energy supply;hardware resources;biosignal compressor;compression technique;Huffman table;wireless communication;wearable device energy consumption;Electrocardiography;Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Monitoring;Encoding;Histograms;Biomedical Healthcare;Wearable Devices;Approximate Computing;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT},   doi={10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

With slight side effect and irritation, traditional Chinese medicine has successfully made its own way in strengthening, diagnosing and curing. But shortcomings still exist. Its teaching and diagnosing pattern with subjectivity has made it truly hard to standardize and systematize, citizens find it increasingly inconvenient to see a doctor, especially in area with dense population and poor medical condition, etc. However, with the rapid development of cyber techniques nowadays, projecting the theory of traditional Chinese medicine into cyber space, which is also called as cyber-enabled, would be very likely to solve these problems. We recommend a new therapy method, which we name as cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine. It would enable people to diagnose and cure disease by themselves. Sensors embedded in wearable devices could be used to continuously collect and transmit data, while terminator could analyze data and give diagnostic results and prescriptions. During the whole process, the idea of traditional Chinese medicine are considered and applied, which is the crux of our method. Cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine's advantages would be generally demonstrated in two aspects: first, taken copious factors into consideration, cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine would become more efficient and accurate, second, people could easily diagnose and cure diseases by themselves. Thus, everyone would have access to high-quality medical service without going to hospital. Besides, taking advantages of the Internet of things and big data, based on traditional therapy, adding into accurate data and efficient algorithm, this new method would promote traditional Chinese medicine, providing a new way for existing medical system.},   keywords={medical diagnostic computing;cyber-enabled traditional Chinese medicine;time-honored medical science;wearable devices;Internet of things;therapy method;cyber space;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Curing;Medical treatment;Computers;Blood;cyber-enabled;traditional Chinese medicine;therapy method;diagnose;cure;disease},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.106},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework.

Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of "things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we "acquire" and "distribute" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions. The scheme puts users (including organizational entities) in the center of control over the access to their collections of sensory data.

Microcameras with real time image processing can serve a wide range of applications like face or gesture recognition as well as traffic sign detection or lane departure warning. Today's microcameras consist of an optics module with lenses and image sensor, which is attached by a flex cable or connector to one or more PCB's with image processor and other required components. Drawback of this construction is limited reliability, relatively large size and high cost. This paper describes the development and realization of an extremely compact microcamera module using a highly efficient Panel Level Packaging (PLP) technology. Most components are embedded into a PCB of 16×16 mm2 size and 3.6 mm thickness with a weight of only 2 g. On top of the PCB a 3 MPixel image sensor is soldered. The basis of the module is a Cognivue image processor. Additionally the module contains 256 Mbit Flash Memory, 5 DC/DC converters, an oscillator and several passives. In total 74 components are embedded into the PCB. The module was completely realized on PCB format with in total 77 modules per 12"x9" panel. All process steps, from component assembly to final test, were performed on panel level.

However, achieving effective detection while not imposing burdens on users is never an easy task. To solve this problem, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm using light switches is proposed. By using an unsupervised approach, care takers in nursing homes do not need to label the collected data. By using information generated by smart switches, senior citizens are not forced to use wearables, change the battery or feel privacy invasion from cameras. Our solution adopts the statistical-based algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). By adding constrains to reduce the high variances of the mixture model and recursively removing the extremely-low probability data from the model, a more accurate mixture model can be constructed.

 title={Development of IoT-Based Impedometric Biosensor for Point-of-Care Monitoring of Bone Loss}, 
  year={2018},   volume={8},   number={2},   pages={211-220},   abstract={Early detection of disease is essential for an efficient treatment. Bone loss can be detected and monitored by regular measurement of serum or urine C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx-1). Therefore, rapid, portable, and low-cost point-of-care devices are highly desirable. In this paper, we have reported an Internet of Things (IoT)-based selective, sensitive, quick, and inexpensive device for the quantification of CTx-1 levels in serum. A capacitive interdigital sensor was coated with artificial antibodies, prepared by molecular imprinting technology. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate the resistive and capacitive properties of the sample solutions. A microcontroller-based system was developed for the measurement of the level of CTx-1 in serum and for data transmission to an IoT-based cloud server. The data can be provided to the medical practitioner and a detailed investigation can start for early detection and treatment. The developed sensing system responded linearly in a range of 0.1 to 2.5 ppb, which covers the normal reference range of CTx-1 in serum, with a limit of detection of 0.09 ppb. The results demonstrated that the proposed portable biosensing system could provide a rapid, simple, and selective approach for CTx-1 measurement in serum. Sheep serum samples were tested using the proposed system and the validation of the results was done using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.},   keywords={biochemistry;biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;biosensors;bone;capacitive sensors;cloud computing;computerised instrumentation;diseases;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;electrochemical sensors;enzymes;Internet of Things;medical diagnostic computing;microcontrollers;molecular biophysics;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment;portable instruments;point-of-care monitoring;bone loss;urine C-terminal telopeptide;type 1 collagen;point-of-care devices;CTx-1 levels;capacitive interdigital sensor;molecular imprinting technology;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;resistive properties;capacitive properties;microcontroller-based system;portable biosensing system;CTx-1 measurement;sheep serum samples;IoT-based impedometric biosensor;disease;Internet of Things-based selective device;artificial antibody;data transmission;IoT-based cloud server;medical practitioner;enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit;efficient patient treatment;Impedance;Biosensors;Bones;Coatings;Monitoring;Testing;Point-of-care (PoC) testing;bone turnover markers;interdigital sensor;molecular imprinting polymer (MIP);Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/JETCAS.2018.2819204},   ISSN={2156-3357},   month={June},}

Under these circumstances, Internet of Things has provided a much easier solution for remote real-time health monitoring of patients from the hospital as well as home. Sensors acquire the data of various parameters regarding patients' health, and the Internet of Things stores that data and displays through the website, which provides access for remote monitoring. Use of Sensor reduces the human error, and the size of the system reduces the occupied space of the room. The unique part of this proposed solution is the alarm generation to provide the prescribed medicine to the patient in time. The other beneficial area of the system is the scheme of sending the notification through email and SMS alert if any of the health parameters crosses the threshold value. Notification scheme will keep the respective authority conscious of the situation. Another significant area of the proposed solution is to create the optimum surroundings as per the requirement of patient's health condition.

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={3076-3086},   abstract={The intelligent wearable heart rate measurement requirement has attracted more and more attention, and the related applications of Internet of Things are emerging. However, under intensive physical exercises, motion artifacts are strong interference sources for wrist-type photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor signals, thus significantly affecting the accurate estimation of heart rate and other physiological parameters. Currently, how to effectively remove the motion artifacts from PPG sensor signals is becoming an active and challenging research realm. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel spectral matrix decomposition (MC-SMD) model to accurately estimate heart rate in the presence of intensive physical activities. Motivated by the observation that the PPG signal spectrum and the acceleration spectrum have almost the same spectral peak positions in the frequency domain, we first model the removal of motion artifacts as a spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem. After removing motion artifacts, we propose a new spectral peak tracking method for estimating heart rate. Experimental results on the well-known PPG data sets recorded from 12 subjects during intensive movements demonstrate that MC-SMD can efficiently remove the motion artifacts and retrieve an accurate heart rate using multi-channel PPG sensor signals.},   keywords={cardiology;frequency-domain analysis;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;matrix decomposition;medical signal processing;optimisation;photoplethysmography;spectral matrix decomposition-based motion artifact removal;multichannel PPG sensor signal;intelligent wearable heart rate measurement;Internet of Things;wrist-type photoplethysmography sensor signal;heart rate estimation;physiological parameter;MC-SMD model;intensive physical activity;frequency domain;spectral peak position;spectral matrix decomposition optimization problem;spectral peak tracking method;Heart rate;Acceleration;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Estimation;Tracking;Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method;compressive sensing;heart rate measurement;photoplethysmography (PPG)},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2580594},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2962-2965},   abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},   keywords={cardiology;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes;map reduce;large-scale dynamic network;Internet-of-hearts;sensing technology;mobile technology;smart connected healthcare;data analytics;mobile health system;disease pattern recognition;stochastic gradient descent approach;global network;network optimization;multiple processors;parallel computing;Parallel processing;Sensors;Program processors;Monitoring;Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Algorithms;Heart;Humans;Internet;Stochastic Processes;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351},   ISSN={1558-4615},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={129-138},   abstract={Traditional standalone embedded system and its computational elements firmly connect with physical entities such as Input-Output devices and sensor networks in IoT applications such as medical monitoring, smart grids, smart cities, environmental monitoring systems which are gaining attraction among institutions and industries. A huge quantity of sensors are added to the IoT, and the processing of a large amount of data coming from Input-Output devices and sensor networks increases the energy consumption. To have more efficiency, the mobility of IoT based system requires low energy consumption. Smart devices perform the data offloading to external devices with increased communication effort, and this effort contribute to the overall power consumption of the smart devices. This power hungry nature of the communication infrastructure and computational resources using cloud computing is not very much suitable to design the future computational system. This nature changed the trend to shift the smartness of the things more adjacent to the things themselves and network edge (FoG) instead of towards the cloud.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={204-209},   abstract={In this paper, we have proposed novel framework for compressing the ultrasound images for IoT enabled telesonography. In ultrasound images, the diagnostic information is constrained to a particular region in the image, and sonographers look for that particular region for doing diagnosis. Therefore, by transmitting only that particular region to the remote sonographer, a significant compression can be achieved. Diagnostic information present in an image is organ specific, hence we came up with a framework to detect the organs and compress accordingly. We developed automated, semi-automated and manual algorithms for detecting the organs in an image. The automated and semi-automated algorithms for organ detection are based on Viola Jones and active shape model respectively. The detected organ is JPEG compressed and transmitted to remote sonographer through WebRTC technology. WebRTC enables direct browser-to-browser connection enabling fast and secure transmission of data. Organ detection algorithms are implemented through WebRTC and hence there is no need to install any softwares at the end devices. With the proposed framework, any ultrasound scanner can access service from the server, compress it and transmit to the expert end. The remote sonographer from anywhere can connect to the ultrasound scanner with his laptop, mobile, tablet etc., for doing diagnosis. The performance of proposed framework is evaluated by computing the compression efficiency on ten kidney ultrasound images.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;biomedical ultrasonics;data compression;image coding;Internet of Things;kidney;medical image processing;security of data;telemedicine;ultrasonic imaging;diagnostically driven compression algorithms;WebRTC;IoT enabled telesonography;ultrasound image compressing;diagnostic information;remote sonographer;specific organ image;semiautomated algorithms;organ detection;Viola Jones;active shape model;compressed JPEG;browser-to-browser connection;data security transmission;organ detection algorithms;ultrasound scanner;laptop;mobile phone;tablet;compression efficiency;kidney ultrasound images;Ultrasonic imaging;Shape;WebRTC;Image coding;Kidney;Image segmentation},   doi={10.1109/IECBES.2016.7843443},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={475-480},   abstract={The US healthcare Affordable Care Act established the 30 day readmission protection program as one of the base lines of measuring quality of care at hospitals and post discharge. With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.},   keywords={cloud computing;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient care;risk analysis;data availability;loT enabled cloud based e-health;US healthcare affordable care act;30 day readmission protection program;care quality;hospitals;post discharge;reduced payment penalties;post discharge care;proactive care;risk patterns;Internet of things;readmission avoidance efforts;e-health architecture;healthcare outcomes;data unavailability;compromised data;Context;Electronic mail;Wide area networks;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Sensors;Collaboration;Cloud;Management;Internet of things;e-health;Predictive Analytics;Sensors;Policy;M2M;30 day readmission},   doi={10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257621},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={20},   number={4},   pages={49-54},   abstract={Wireless power transfer (WPT) is an old subject, introduced for the first time by Nikola Tesla in the twentieth century [1]. His patent proposal was based on the magnetic resonance of two coils to distribute large amounts of energy to distant places of consumption. The subject returned to the mainstream in the last decade due to the exponential growth in the number of electronic devices. Currently, the main goal is to achieve ubiquity of WPT with the consolidation of the Internet of Things (IoT). How to supply the energy necessary to operate this huge network of gadgets is still a problem waiting for a solution. Three main aspects must be considered when outlining the powering strategy of those forthcoming technologies: small physical volume, high energy efficiency, and compatible aesthetics. Other emerging topics have similar requirements, such as battery-less medical implanted devices, remote contactless, and radio frequency identification (RFID), to mention a few. Current techniques envisaged for WPT are founded on the transmission of energy by electromagnetic fields. Both far- and near-field strategies have been studied; however, in this paper we focus on the latter, specifically on inductive power transfer (IPT). A typical IPT system can be thought of as an aircore transformer connected to a load and a source by passive networks. These networks provide the necessary impedance transformation for maximizing the power transfer from source to load. The key to achieving high transfer efficiency is to minimize the losses on the passives, including the transformer inductors. Moreover, the magnetic coupling factor between the inductances should be as high as possible. In this article, we review the modeling of a typical IPT link and discuss the criteria for maximizing the power transferred to the load as well as the power transfer efficiency. In addition, we report application-specific IPT designs and characterization which have been addressed by Brazilian researchers.},   keywords={impedance convertors;inductive power transmission;inductors;Internet of Things;power transfer efficiency;magnetic coupling factor;transformer inductors;impedance transformation;aircore transformer;IPT system;inductive power transfer;near-field strategies;far-field strategies;electromagnetic fields;contactless instrumentation;compatible aesthetics;energy efficiency;physical volume;IoT;Internet of Things;electronic devices;magnetic resonance;WPT;wireless power transfer;Wireless power transfer;Inductors;Capacitors;Magnetic resonance;Receivers;Wireless communication},   doi={10.1109/MIM.2017.8006394},   ISSN={1094-6969},   month={August},}

Furthermore, fall is a direct or indirect factor causing severe traumas such as brain injuries or bone fractures. However, timely medical attention might help to avoid serious consequences from a fall. A viable solution to solve this is an IoT-based system which takes advantage of wireless sensor networks, wearable devices, Fog and Cloud computing. To deliver sufficient degree of reliability, wearable devices working at the core of a fall detection system, are required to work for prolonged period of time. In this paper we investigate energy consumption of sensor nodes in an IoT-based fall detection system and present a design of a customized sensor node. In addition, we compare the customized sensor node with other sensor nodes, built on general purpose development boards. The results show that sensor nodes based on delicate customized devices are more energy efficient than the others based on general purpose devices while considering identical specification of micro-controller and memory capacity.

A variant of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, dual encryption, and Merkle hash trees are used to support fine-grained access control, efficient dynamic data auditing, batch auditing, and attribute revocation.

We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud.

While flexible and stretchable device themes are being remarkably chased, the realization of the fully compliant electronic system is unaddressed. Integration of data processing, storage, communication, and energy management devices complements a compliant system. Here, a comprehensive review is presented on necessity and design criteria for freeform (physically flexible and stretchable) compliant high-performance CMOS electronic systems.},   keywords={CMOS integrated circuits;energy conservation;flexible electronics;Internet of Things;freeform compliant CMOS electronic systems;Internet of Everything;mobile device;computational technology;information technology;energy-efficient scaled electronics;stretchable device themes;flexible device themes;data processing;energy management devices;Flexible electronics;Medical services;Internet of Things;CMOS integrated circuits;Flexible electronics;free-form compliant system;healthcare;Internet of Everything (IoE);stretchable electronics},   doi={10.1109/TED.2016.2642340},   ISSN={0018-9383},   month={May},}

Researchers have found critical vulnerabilities such as compromise of private health data, hackers monitoring private conversations via a baby monitor, compromise of a moving internet enabled car or shutting it down altogether while in motion. Attention to security is not increasing at the same rapid pace as the number of IoT devices. Hence, security is beginning to be a major concern with the advent of IoT, connecting numerous devices introducing new attack vectors. This paper is intended to focus on the benefits of integrating security in IoT. The paper begins with design and implementation of a basic Health Monitor for remote monitoring and tracking of pulse rate and body temperature of patients treated in hospitals. While developing the Health Monitor, security is integrated in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). This integration intends to demonstrate identification and mitigation of the critical known security vulnerabilities thereby producing a much secure end product. Additional security assurance is provided by testing the IoT Health Monitor for applicable five of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 IoT vulnerabilities: (1) Insecure Web Interface, (2) Insufficient Authentication/Authorization, (3) Lack of Transport Encryption, (4) Privacy Concerns, and (5) Insufficient Security Configurability.

For fast data acquisition or other inevitable reasons, however, only a small amount of samples may be acquired, and thus, how to recover the full signal becomes an active research topic, but existing approaches cannot efficiently recover N-dimensional exponential signals with N ≥ 3. In this paper, we study the problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly N ≥ 3) exponential signals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor structure and the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of Hankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonance spectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover full signals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;signal reconstruction;Hankel matrix nuclear norm regularized tensor completion;n-dimensional exponential signals;data acquisition;low-rank tensor completion problem;signal reconstruction;magnetic resonance spectroscopy data;Tensile stress;Spectroscopy;Nuclear magnetic resonance;Image reconstruction;Frequency-domain analysis;Compressed sensing;Minimization;Tensor completion;exponential signal;Hankel matrix;low rank;spectroscopy;NMR},   doi={10.1109/TSP.2017.2695566},   ISSN={1053-587X},   month={July},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={45-52},   abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},   keywords={backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;artificial neural network-based approach;chronic disease prediction model;population aging;Internet of Things;IoT technology;healthcare technology;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;cardiovascular diseases;quality of life improvement;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;ANN;binary logistic regression model;behavior risk factor surveillance system;BRFSS;multilayer perception neural network model;MLP neural network model;back propagation;BP algorithm;area under the receiver-operator curve;AUC;Hypertension;Diseases;Predictive models;Logistics;Artificial neural networks;Analytical models;Regression analysis;logistic regression;artifical neural network;hypertension prediction},   doi={10.1109/iThings.2014.16},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Exploiting the social relationship link between healthcare user (e.g., patients and elderly people) and healthcare provider (e.g., physicians), social networks can play the role of a trusted online platform to establish service application interfaces between healthcare user (HU) and healthcare provider (HP). This enables the Internet of things (IoT) medical devices (e.g., IoT body sensor) to timely share the bio-data of HU with remote HP via the both storage-rich and computational resource-rich social networks. Given the high security requirement on SIoT data sharing and the fact that resource-constrained IoT devices cannot efficiently execute complicated cryptography, a robust and cost-effective two-phase security method is proposed by exploiting the device-specific physical-layer (PHY) attributes. Specifically, the PHY carrier frequency offset and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance of an IoT device are practically estimated to generate the PHY-ID. Using our PHY-ID, the SIoT HU authentication and the bio-data confidentiality are simultaneously enhanced without posing any additional implementation overhead at IoT body sensors, which is especially applicable for the resource-constrained IoT devices.},   keywords={body sensor networks;computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;social networking (online);bio-data confidentiality;IoT body sensor;PHY-aided secure IoT healthcare system;social relationship link;healthcare user;healthcare provider;trusted online platform;service application interfaces;remote HP;computational resource-rich social networks;SIoT data sharing;novel physical-layer-aided security technique;social Internet of things architecture-based healthcare system;Internet of things medical devices;storage-rich social networks;device-specific physical layer attributes;PHY carrier frequency offset;SIoT HU authentication;PHY-ID;in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance;two-phase security method;resource-constrained IoT devices;Medical services;Estimation;Social network services;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288341},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Increasingly, however, distributed applications involve multiple loci of autonomy. Research in multiagent systems (MAS) addresses autonomy by drawing on concepts and techniques from artificial intelligence. However, MAS research generally lacks an adequate understanding of modern distributed computing. In this Blue Sky paper, we envision decentralized multiagent systems as a way to place decentralized intelligence in distributed computing, specifically, by supporting computation at the level of social meanings. We motivate our proposals for research in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has become a major thrust in distributed computing. From the IoT's representative applications, we abstract out the major challenges of relevance to decentralized intelligence. These include the heterogeneity of IoT components; asynchronous and delay-tolerant communication and decoupled enactment; and multiple stakeholders with subtle requirements for governance, incorporating resource usage, cooperation, and privacy. The IoT yields high-impact problems that require solutions that go beyond traditional ways of thinking.

Yet traditional healthcare systems are facing challenges such as lack of ubiquity, use of backdated techniques, inadequacies in tracking, observing and reporting status of patients and diseases as well as unaffordability. However, modern updates in IoT, cloud computing, mobile and web development and computer vision technology are offering us a wider scope in providing an effective health care system to everyone. The assistance includes automation in systematic monitoring of patients, transmission of medical data at real-time, saving those data in cloud servers, manipulate data for future use, presenting real time scenario to stake holders and many more. Here we suggest a wireless network infrastructure that will provide useful health and medical services to children and adults as well as assist in distributing vaccines, tablets and personnel to monitor endemic diseases. We have two components in our system, first one is the clinic booth accompanied by health workers. This system assists health workers in their work and acquire personalized data and sends them to an online server for future use. Second is the administration and presentation of the ground data to stake holders. In our preliminary network evaluation of the IoT powered clinic booth design we found average response time of 1.5 seconds with uptime of 98.16%.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;smart health care system;underdeveloped countries;hospital;endemic diseases;tablets;medical services;wireless network infrastructure;cloud servers;computer vision technology;web development;cloud computing;IoT;Pediatrics;Servers;Temperature measurement;Software;Diseases;Vaccines;Cloud computing;internet of things;tiny and affordable computers;health care system;sensors;mobile and web development},   doi={10.1109/ICTP.2017.8285926},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Due to the many beneficial effects on physical and mental health and strong association with many fitness and rehabilitation programs, physical activity (PA) recognition has been considered as a key paradigm for internet of things (IoT) healthcare. Traditional PA recognition techniques focus on repeated aerobic exercises or stationary PA. As a crucial indicator in human health, it covers a range of bodily movement from aerobics to anaerobic that may all bring health benefits. However, existing PA recognition approaches are mostly designed for specific scenarios and often lack extensibility for application in other areas, thereby limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we attempt to detect more gym physical activities (GPAs) in addition to traditional PA using acceleration, A two layer recognition framework is proposed that can classify aerobic, sedentary and free weight activities, count repetitions and sets for the free weight exercises, and in the meantime, measure quantities of repetitions and sets for free weight activities. In the first layer, a one-class SVM (OC-SVM) is applied to coarsely classify free weight and non-free weight activities. In the second layer, a neural network (NN) is utilized for aerobic and sedentary activities recognition; a hidden Markov model (HMM) is to provide a further classification in free weight activities. The performance of the framework was tested on 10 healthy subjects (age: 30 &amp;#x00B1; 5; BMI: 25 &amp;#x00B1; 5.5 kg/m2; body fat: 20.5 &amp;#x00B1; 5.4), and compared with some typical classifiers. The results indicate the proposed framework has better performance in recognizing and measuring GPAs than other approaches. The potential of this framework can be extended in supporting more types of PA recognition in complex applications.},   keywords={Training;Hidden Markov models;Activity recognition;Internet of Things;Artificial neural networks;Medical services;Support vector machines;Internet of things;physical activity recognition;free weight training;wearable sensors.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846359},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In spite of various Internet of Things (IoT) designs available in the literature, power resources often limit the lifetime of IoT. Regarding this weakness, this paper develops a new motion sensor system in wearable IoT (WIoT) for human physical activity recognition without any signal conditioning circuits. The triboelectricity-based physical model is explored in designing the motion sensor. It enables to collect motion signals caused by physical activities without any power supply. In addition, the triboelectric structure can be used as an energy harvester for motion harvesting due to its high output voltage in random low-frequency motion and a relatively stable voltage when involving continuous activities. Such a new design lays the foundations for constructing the next generation self-powered WIoT systems. Our new design has been extensively evaluated, where most common activities including sitting and standing, walking, climbing upstairs and downstairs, and running are used. The experimental results demonstrate that our system can achieve similar comparable performance as the state of the art for physical activity recognition at an average successful accuracy of over 80%. At the same time, our system reduces more than 25% energy consumption of the entire sensing hardware system which includes the sensor, microcontroller, and corresponding circuits.},   keywords={Activity recognition;Energy harvesting;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Medical services;Physical activity recognition;wearable IoT;triboelectric;motion energy harvesting.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2817841},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

However, its high integration has not been achieved yet owing to a difficulty in downscaling of the memory cell including one transistor and one capacitor. One of the solutions to realize the very small capacitors is the employment of multi-shell nanowires (NWs) including ferroelectrics. We have already established fabrication process of ferroelectric NWs/nanotubes by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using conductive ZnO NWs as a template. Hence, we have proposed the introduction of ZnO/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnO NW capacitors into FeRAM memory cells using HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a ferroelectric. In this study, we focus on the crystallization of HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers on ZnO NW. ZnO NWs used as a template for NW capacitors were grown on Pt-covered SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si substrate by MOCVD using Zn(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a precursor and oxidizing gas, respectively.

The diameter and aspect ratio of ZnO NW used as template were 200nm and 55, respectively. HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin film with a thickness of 20nm was uniformly deposited on ZnO NWs by MOCVD.

This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors. This simulator can also generate logs text files with big data for applying offline big data techniques on them.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={788-793},   abstract={As the world's population of senior citizens continues to grow, the burdens on the professionals who care for them (carers) are also increasing. In nursing homes, carers need to make a daily report for each resident aiming to improve his/her quality of life. However, in the present understaffed situation, it is difficult and burdensome for carers to record the resident's activity in detail since each carer needs to take care of several residents at the same time. In this paper, we propose an automatic daily report generation system which can monitor the activity of multiple residents in nursing homes. Knowing that important activities such as toilet, bathing, rehabilitation and so on take place in specific areas in a nursing home, it is possible to record residents' activities by tracking their stay areas and movement between the areas within the day. Our proposed system estimates stay areas of multiple residents by machine learning for RSSI values that are sent from BLE beacons attached to residents and received at BLE scanners deployed over multiple areas, and records activities of the residents determined based on their estimated stay areas. The proposed system can also output a daily report of each resident based on the recorded data. We carried out a five-day experiment with four elderly participants in a nursing home and evaluated activity estimation accuracy by leave-one-person-out cross-validation. As a result, our proposed system achieved the weighted average F-measure of 81.6%.},   keywords={Medical services;Activity recognition;Servers;Estimation;Smoothing methods;Monitoring;Senior citizens;Healthcare Industrial Internet of Things (HealthI–IoT);Random Forest;Bluetooth Low Energy},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480348},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

The method adopted can help the doctor to treat a person with gait abnormalities. Gait analysis deals with the study of walking pattern, in order to understand the gait abnormalities. To treat these gait abnormalities it's necessary to analyse gait parameters such as foot angle, stride distance, step distance, step count, cadence, speed, progression line etc. This project presents a shoe device to measure these parameters with the help of various sensors such as accelerometer, ultrasonic sensor, gyroscope, foot pressure sensor, flex sensor etc. These sensors can be placed in the shoe such that sensors can accurately measure these parameters. The digital output of these sensors can be integrated through a controller and the result of the patient is sent to the doctor's phone or to a GSM device. Hence, this wireless shoe device helps to overcome the disadvantages of the existing system which is practiced in gait motion analysis laboratory. Results of shoe device can be compared with the gait of a normal person in order to differentiate and study the abnormal and normal gait of a person. The development of shoe device is mainly concerned with features like low cost, portable, ease of use and accurate measurements of gait parameters. The objective of shoe integrated sensor system for gait analysis is to provide better digital output results of the abnormal parameters and efficient way of analyzing than clinical gait.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={24-29},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology and infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Networked body sensing devices coupled with sensors in our living environment enable the real-time and continuous collection of information related to an individual's physical and mental health and related behaviors. Captured in a continual basis and aggregated, such information needs to be effectively exploited to permit real-time, continuous and personalized monitoring, treatments and interventions. However, medical decisions are often sequential and uncertain in nature. Sequential decision-making models such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) constitute powerful tools for modeling and solving such stochastic and dynamic problems. In this paper, an overview of such models that are expected to support proactive, preventive and personalized healthcare delivery are surveyed along with the associated solution techniques. A set of representative health applications that take advantage of such tools is also described. Finally, various challenges and opportunities that arise during the realization of smart and connected healthcare IoT are highlighted.},   keywords={decision making;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;real-time systems;sequential decision-making;healthcare IoT;real-time health monitoring;Internet of Things technology;healthcare delivery;networked body sensing devices;mental health;medical decisions;MDP;partially observable MDPs;POMDP;Markov decision processes;constrained Markov decision processes;partially observable Markov decision processes;semi-Markov decision processes;partially observable semi-Markov decision processes;multi-armed bandits;stochastic optimal control;dynamic programming;e-health},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845446},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

In this paper, we are bound to limelight in this field which focuses briefly over the child health monitoring. In this work, we implemented a smart and secure health care monitor application that personify the monitoring of total health and mind status of the children. As part of which we are adopting the use of wireless sensors that will keep the child to get monitored. Our system enables the child to get involved with some android games which will make him/her to think and act dynamically. The game scores and the sensor readings obtained from the child will be monitored and analyzed by the system and actions will be taken accordingly. Since the data generated by the system are humongous, we adopt Hadoop in the background to effectively map the data and to reduce it into elementary. As this data need confidentiality in transmission, Apache Ranger is being used for the secure transmission and for the classification of the child behavior, C4.5 decision algorithm is used in the system.

Hypertension is an increasing in systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg. Increased blood pressure that lasts for a long time can cause damage to the kidneys (renal failure), heart (coronary heart disease), and brain (causing a stroke). Many hypertension patients with uncontrolled blood pressure. Based on report of the Indonesian Ministry of Health in 2014 regarding hypertension, nationally 25.8% of Indonesia's population suffer from hypertension. A topic that is being discussed is the M2M services in health sector. Utilization of M2M services in health sector is expected to help or improve existing health services. M2M technology connects machines, devices and equipment through various types of communication. This makes the device into a smart device that can communicate with each other. In this paper, we propose design of M2M communication system that are not only monitor the patient, but also can provide medical recommendations. The treatment can be monitored by doctor. In this system, there will be two devices and a mobile application. The first device is sphygmomanometer connected to the microcontroller, the second device is medicine box connected to the microcontroller, and a mobile application.

This paper aims to establish a non-invasive assessment model with serum markers using cloud computing and the Internet of Things for the evaluation of liver disease severity and its prognosis. Based on the Internet of Things, the multiple and key information system of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis are constructed using the serum markers data. In the cloud platform, the probability density functions of indexes are used to select the optimized indicators. The logistic regression is used to establish the non-invasive assessment model. The patients were selected with CHB and underwent liver biopsy in the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. There are two inclusion criteria: first, the patient received a liver biopsy according to “Proclaim Prevention and Cure Guide For Chronic Hepatitis B”of Chinese Medical Association in 2015; second, the patient has a history of hepatitis B or HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive more than six months, and HBsAg and (or) HBV DNA is still positive. Results of clinical data applications show that the accuracy of the non-invasive assessment model reaches greater than 70% for the recognition of significant liver fibrosis. In addition, the discriminant accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of indicators. The established non-invasive assessment model can be used for auxiliary clinical diagnosis after the further validation.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;DNA;Internet of Things;liver;medical diagnostic computing;medical information systems;microorganisms;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;probability;regression analysis;auxiliary clinical diagnosis;HBV DNA;HBsAg;HBV surface antigen;Chinese Medical Association;Proclaim Prevention and Cure Guide For Chronic Hepatitis B;Central South University;Second Xiangya Hospital;logistic regression;probability density functions;cirrhosis;information system;antiviral treatment;chronic hepatitis B virus;Internet of Things;liver fibrosis;liver biopsy;serum markers data;cloud computing;liver disease severity;noninvasive assessment model;Cloud computing;Liver diseases;Computational modeling;Indexes;Internet of Things;Biopsy;Non-invasive assessment;cloud computing;serum markers;liver disease severity},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849016},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This provides a set of services for both patients and their caregivers that support the full continuum of the multidimensional care approach of diabetes. The platform's software architecture pattern enables the development of various applications without knowing low-level details of the platform. This is achieved through unifying the access interface and mechanism of handling service requests through a layered approach based on object virtualization and automatic service delivery.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={53-60},   abstract={In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;firewalls;health care;hospitals;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;wireless LAN;on-demand IoT device tunneling service;on-demand WebRTC service;WebRTC gateway service;ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic;local hospital network;local home network;tunnel sensor;medical devices;home-care deployments;hospital firewall;external machines;NAT;local WiFi network;VPN solutions;WebRTC traffic;concurrent streams;local gateway services;direct browser-to-browser connection;WebRTC;Logic gates;Browsers;Protocols;Hospitals;Ports (Computers);Standards;webrtc;rtc;palcom;iot;medical applications},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.19},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

In our research, we work with an unusual substrate for microtechnologies such as paper, which is flexible, brittle, and biodegradable. Also, it can be folded, cut, perforated, crumpled, etc. This article focuses on monitoring porous Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) layer on paper-based substrate for the detection of humidity. Porous AAO is a material with cylindrical pore geometry and high aspect ratio. Further, this material has many advantages, such as, easy fabrication, pore diameter's uniformity with high pore density (10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) and its use like humidity sensors. In summary, the AAO process fabrication on paper substrate is challenging causes of his ease of implementation, cost-effective and the use of a highly economical, conformable and ecological substrate. In this study, an experimental setup had been developed to anodize an aluminum layer deposit on flexible substrate by using phosphoric acid. Various anodization parameters (voltage, current density, temperature and concentration) have been investigated to obtain an AAO layer with good electrical properties and high reliability on flexible substrate. An interdigital capacitance has been deposited on the best AAO layer produced to fabricate a moisture sensor. The different sensors produced had been characterized versus humidity concentration and frequency in a climatic chamber. Depending on the AAO morphology parameters, the average sensitivity can be tuned from 0.8 pF/RH% to 9 pF/RH%.},   keywords={aluminium compounds;anodisation;capacitance;flexible electronics;humidity sensors;paper;phosphors;porosity;thin film sensors;paper-based substrate;moisture sensor feasibility;flexible electronics;electronics component;Internet Of Things;food safety;medical diagnostic applications;microtechnology;porous AAO layer;cylindrical pore geometry;high aspect ratio;AAO process fabrication;aluminum layer deposit;flexible substrate;phosphoric acid;anodization parameters;interdigital capacitance;climatic chamber;AAO morphology parameters;Al2O3;Voltage measurement;Moisture measurement;Pressure measurement;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Polymers;Artificial intelligence;nanoporous AAO layer;humidity sensor;paper-based substrate;thin film;aluminium oxide},   doi={10.1109/DTIP.2015.7161018},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally.

 title={Neural Network Classifiers Using Stochastic Computing with a Hardware-Oriented Approximate Activation Function}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={97-104},   abstract={Neural networks are becoming prevalent in many areas, such as pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. Stochastic computing is one potential solution for neural networks implemented in low-power back-end devices such as solar-powered devices and Internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we investigate a new architecture of stochastic neural networks with a hardware-oriented approximate activation function. The new proposed approximate activation function can be omitted while keeping the functionality well. Thus, it reduces the stochastic implementation complexity and hardware costs. Moreover, the new architecture significantly improves recognition error rates compared to previous stochastic neural networks with sigmoid function. Three classical types of neural networks are explored, multiple layer perceptron (MLP), restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The experimental results indicate the new proposed architecture achieves more than 25%, 60% and 3× reduction than previous stochastic neural networks, and more than 30×, 30× and 52% reduction than conventional binary neural networks, in terms of area, power and energy, respectively, while maintaining the similar error rates compared to the conventional neural networks.},   keywords={Boltzmann machines;multilayer perceptrons;neural net architecture;pattern classification;stochastic processes;solar-powered devices;Internet-of-things devices;approximate activation function;stochastic implementation complexity;sigmoid function;convolutional neural networks;neural network classifiers;stochastic computing;pattern recognition;medical diagnosis;low-power back-end devices;stochastic neural networks;multiple layer perceptron;restricted Boltzmann machine;Biological neural networks;Hardware;Logic gates;Neurons;Error analysis;Stochastic processes;Computer architecture;Neural network;Stochastic computing;Approximate activation function;Hardware implementation},   doi={10.1109/ICCD.2017.23},   ISSN={1063-6404},   month={Nov},}

 title={An Automatic Health Monitoring System for Patients Suffering From Voice Complications in Smart Cities}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={3900-3908},   abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},   keywords={cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;signal detection;smart cities;speech processing;running speech;sustained vowel;energy distribution;linear prediction analysis;source signal;automatic voice disorder detection system;healthcare resources;elderly people;smart healthcare systems;smart technologies;cloud computing;Internet of Things;smart cities;voice complications;automatic health monitoring system;frequency 1 Hz to 1562 Hz;Speech;Smart cities;Monitoring;Medical services;Senior citizens;Feature extraction;Acoustics;Smart cities;health monitoring;voice disorders;liner prediction;GMM},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2680467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={290-296},   abstract={MQTT-SN offers energy efficient data transportation under unreliable wireless environment with limited energy/ bandwidth. However, MQTT-SN faces a new set of challenges for service guarantees when operated for a reliable or time-critical applications. The impact of various network parameters on the MQTT-SN service assurance requires an end-to-end system study, which are unexplored yet. In this paper we analyze in detail about the end-to-end service assurance parameters such as content delivery delay and probability of content delivery for a MQTT-SN to be used in health care Internet of Things (IoT). To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals. Both these service assurance parameters will give more insight into the number of content/request arrivals that can be supported for a given service assurance requirement. In addition these service assurance parameters will be of help to design the system more effectively. We carry out a detailed ns2 based simulation to show impacts of various system parameters on the network performances for various QoS services designed for MQTT-SN system.},   keywords={computer network reliability;delay estimation;energy conservation;Internet of Things;probability;quality of service;queueing theory;radiotelemetry;telecommunication scheduling;transport protocols;wireless sensor networks;NS2 based simulation;QoS service;content delivery delay estimation;end-to-end content delivery probability;TOPIC ID based matching station;round-robin queue scheduler;UDP;TCP;health care Internet of Things;message queue telemetry transport;wireless environment;energy efficient data transportation;loT MQTT-SN;end-to-end service assurance;Logic gates;Quality of service;Delays;Medical services;Round robin;Subscriptions;Transportation},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2015.7157991},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},   keywords={compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;long-term health monitoring;signal characteristics;personalized features;physiologic signals;cotraining approach;sensing matrix;isometry property;signal sparsity;ECG signals;compression ratio;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;Sensors;Dictionaries;Sparse matrices;Physiology;Training;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless communication;Data-driven compressive sensing;mobile healthcare;wearable sensing;Internet of things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278},   ISSN={2379-190X},   month={March},}

Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.},   keywords={cryptography;electronic commerce;transaction processing;Bitcoin consistency property;cryptocurrency;blockchain;distributed transaction ledger system;transaction log;ground truth;Online banking;Protocols;Cryptography;Mechanical factors;Medical services;Distributed databases;Bitcoin;Strong Consistency;Eventual Consistency;Blockchain;Distributed System},   doi={10.1109/PRDC.2017.39},   ISSN={2473-3105},   month={Jan},}

Most of these IoT scenarios have multiple producer, multiple consumer (MPMC) environments, with multiple sensors as producers of data, and multiple IoT services as consumers of data. Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={4933-4940},   abstract={Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has many important applications in medical imaging, biology, and chemistry. The 1-D MRS is too crowded for complex samples to retrieve chemical or biological information. The 2-D MRS unfolds the spectrum by introducing another dimension at the cost of much longer data acquisition time. To speed up the data acquisition, one typical way is to sparsely acquire measurements and then reconstruct the spectrum from incomplete observations. Recently, a low rank Hankel matrix (LRHM) approach has shown great potential to reconstruct the spectrum basing on the assumption that the number of spectral peaks is much less than the number of acquired data points. However, low-intensity spectral peaks are compromised in the reconstruction when the data are highly undersampled. In this paper, a weighted LRHM approach is proposed to tackle this problem. A weighted nuclear norm is introduced to better approximate the rank constraint, and a prior signal space is estimated from the prereconstruction to reduce the unknowns in reconstruction. Experimental results on both synthetic and real MRS data demonstrate that the proposed approach can reconstruct low-intensity spectral peaks better than the state-of-the-art LRHM method.},   keywords={data acquisition;Hankel matrices;image reconstruction;image sampling;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;spectral analysis;low intensity magnetic resonance spectroscopy;weighted low rank Hankel matrix completion;low-intensity spectral peaks;weighted LRHM approach;weighted nuclear norm;rank constraint;data acquisition;spectrum basing reconstruction;Image reconstruction;Two dimensional displays;Data acquisition;Mathematical model;Matrix converters;Minimization;Spectroscopy;Magnetic resonance spectroscopy;sparse sampling;Hankel matrix;low rank;nuclear norm},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794478},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={615-620},   abstract={Telemedicine systems for remote monitoring are gaining importance given the increase in aging population. Possible limitations to their diffusion in daily living situations can lay on usability and social acceptability barriers. In this work we propose an architecture for remote monitoring and management of motor disorders applied on Parkinsonian patients suffering of Freezing of Gait (FoG). The architecture is composed of a smartphone app, a database (DB) and a web app, hence it uses only technologies that are well known and diffuse among society. The smartphone app monitors gait parameters and provide acoustic feedback (cues) to the patient when it detects a FoG episode. Furthermore the app stores all the informations collected in a local DB and periodically sends them to the central DB when Internet connection is available. The web app provides graphic user interfaces to query the DB to observe FoG monitoring data and to remotely adjust patient's rehabilitation and pharmacological therapies. The architecture was tested on 6 Parkinsonian patients, results about FoG detection accuracy and cues effectiveness are reported.},   keywords={computerised monitoring;diseases;feedback;graphical user interfaces;Internet;medical disorders;mobile computing;query processing;smart phones;software architecture;telemedicine;motor disorder management;Parkinson disease;telemedicine system;remote monitoring;aging population;freezing of gait;FoG;system architecture;smart phone app;database query;DB query;Web app;acoustic feedback;graphic user interface;Monitoring;Fuzzy sets;Medical treatment;Servers;Fuzzy logic;Sensitivity;Batteries;Smartphone;Web App;Database;Parkinson's Disease},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389124},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Personalized wearable systems for real-time ECG classification and healthcare interoperability: Real-time ECG classification and FHIR interoperability}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={9-14},   abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},   keywords={adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising;ECG classification;wearable health monitoring devices;personalized health-care monitoring devices;signal processing;Savitzky-Golay filter;machine learning models;MIT-BIH Physionet;ECG kits biopotential measurements;kNN classifiers;neural net fitting models;SNOMED coding system;feature extraction method;ECG event observations;MITDB arrhythmia database;recursive least square adaptive filter;3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG waveforms;arrhythmia classification;heart rate variability analysis;electronic health records database;ECG monitoring;wearable biomedical devices;FHIR interoperability;healthcare interoperability;personalized wearable systems;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Adaptive filters;Real-time systems;Arrhythmia classification;Wearable IoT;Healthcare monitoring;ECG signal processing;Arrhythmia detection;Arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;ECG FHIR;SNOMED-CT FHIR;HAPI FHIR},   doi={10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem.

Methods: A fast orthogonal dictionary learning method is introduced into magnetic resonance image reconstruction to provide adaptive sparse representation of images. To enhance the sparsity, image is divided into classified patches according to the same geometrical direction and dictionary is trained within each class. A new sparse reconstruction model with the multiclass dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain imaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling patterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art magnetic resonance image reconstruction methods.

However, co-located deployment of such devices based on different standards using the same 2.4 GHz license free Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) spectrum, introduces coexistence issues, specifically intra-and inter cluster interference. The latter would create a much more adverse impact on these devices than the former, resulting in significant performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel area packet scheduler that allows co-located 802.15.4 and 802.11 devices to share the transmission channel and coexist with minimal inter-cluster interference any inter cluster interference. A new OPNET simulation model was developed to evaluate the performance of this scheduler. Simulation results show that the packet scheduler can mitigate the coexistence problem while maintaining high throughput and low end-to-end delay, thereby increasing the overall network QoS.},   keywords={personal area networks;wireless LAN;coexistence issues;WPAN-WLAN based hetergeneous network;short-range wireless networking standards;inter cluster interference;intra cluster interference;novel area packet scheduler;transmission channel;IoT applications;frequency 2.4 GHz;Wireless LAN;IEEE 802.15 Standards;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Wireless personal area networks;Interference;Delays;Scheduling algorithms;M2M Communications;Heterogeneous Network;OPNET;Co-existence;Packet scheduling;6LoWPAN},   doi={10.1109/ICT.2015.7124704},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

To accommodate the unprecedented rise in population, city administrations around the world are looking for appropriate solutions to cope with the rising challenges. One of the approaches is to make the cities smarter and thus improving the organization, administration and availability of services and resources. In such a Smart City, a large spectrum of deployed sensors and smart objects record, analyse and exchange data. The collected information is processed, forwarded and analyzed in order to implement applications and services that alleviate the city's organization and management or provide additional benefit to the inhabitants. Also with the growing population, it becomes more complex to protect and serve the city's inhabitants and their assets in cases of emergency and adversities such as natural disasters, terrorist and insurgent attacks. In these cases, an existing Smart City infrastructure can greatly assist emergency forces like relief units or supporting military forces by providing the data it already has. In order to incorporate the additional data of the Smart City into the situational picture of the operational forces, suitable points of integration have to be defined and implemented. In this paper, we examine whether existing data models used in the military domain are suitable to integrate the additional Smart City data into the military information domain. In particular, we focus on standardized data models and distribution methods used in federated mission networking within NATO. This ensures a high compatibility to existing situational awareness and information processing applications that are used by the different NATO nations.},   keywords={data integration;data models;disasters;military computing;smart cities;town and country planning;military data model architectures;smart city data consumption;human populations;financial factors;social factors;medical factors;city administrations;exchange data;emergency forces;relief units;supporting military forces;additional data;military domain;additional Smart City data;military information domain;standardized data models;situational awareness;information processing applications;Smart City infrastructure;data integration;Smart cities;Logic gates;Data models;Intelligent sensors;Sociology;Smart City;Interoperability;IoT;NGVA;MIP;SensorML;Sentilo;CitySDK},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355226},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario.

The unavailability of large raw data and data complexity are some of the difficulties encountered.

A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude. Finally, avenues for future research are discussed.},   keywords={body sensor networks;data compression;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable computers;health monitoring;vital parameters;ECG;photoplethysmographic signals;e-health applications;signal transmission;lossy signal compression;biosignal compression algorithms;wearable Internet of Things devices;Biomedical signal processing;energy efficiency;pattern recognition;signal compression;sparse autoencoders;wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689164},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={As we know cloud computing can be defined in many ways, but in simple terms "the cloud" can be called as a metaphor for the Internet, which is quite familiar cliche, but when it combined with "computing," the meaning gets bigger and fuzzier. Several analyst and service vendors define cloud computing as an updated version of Service oriented computing with virtualization: basically virtual servers available over the Internet. In this regard Charles Babcock definition of Cloud Computing serves very well which says, "one of the secrets of cloud computing is that cloud software reflects a new architecture that best exploits the clustered resources around it. It exploits them in such a way that one instance of the software potentially can serve hundreds or thousands of users, and a handful of instances can serve hundreds of thousands." Cloud Computing is needed to address the dynamic, exponentially growing demands for real-time, reliable data processing of 'Internet of Things' . The future of cloud computing services is heading towards offerings of flexible development and deployment environments. The cloud, with its vast elasticity and democratization of software access to end users, has created challenging software delivery problems like cost efficiency delivery, scalability, and the need for codification of critical operating workflows. If we remember middleware/infrastructure software has provided a common layer that acts as a single point of interest shared by IT network level operators and software developers. For example IIS, WebSphere, database servers, etc. typically provide a wealth of tooling to network folks in support of applications. Here cloud middleware system integrators may determine the future adoption of cloud computing. These systems normally support open platform stacks, provide generic interfaces between components, support infrastructure abstraction, and utilize standard communication frameworks. There are several proposed solution available which are known as Cloud Middleware such as Carbon 3.0, WS02, SaaSGrid, Sky Computing, Altocumulus etc. In this tutorial we would like to explore the future of cloud middleware and will discuss about what are the challenges ahead in cloud computing as well as cloud Integration.

Under the background, human activity recognition (HAR) has drawn great attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a discriminant approach to recognize daily human activities recorded through accelerometer sensor. In the proposed approach, we first use S transform (ST) to extract features, and then introduce a supervised regularization-based robust subspace (SRRS) learning method to learn low-dimensional intrinsic feature representation from the original feature subspace. Particularly, ST has been described as a joint time-frequency representation (TFR), which is insensitive to noise. SRRS can learn more robust and discriminative features to reinforce the descriptions of samples while removing noise and redundancy. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets i.e., WISDM, SCUT-NAA and mHealth demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared with state-of-the-art methods.},   keywords={Feature extraction;Accelerometers;Internet of Things;Activity recognition;Medical services;Data mining;Transforms;Internet of Things;wearable computing;human activity recognition;S transform;dimensionality reduction.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2873594},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

The biological signal should be obtained from periodic chest movement consisting of the heartbeat and respiration. However, the heartbeat sensing suffers from body movement because of its smaller displacement relative to breathing motion. Therefore, a stationary subject is assumed for conventional heartbeat monitoring schemes. However, some displacement of a body should be presented during the measurement. This paper suggests a heartbeat estimation scheme with high accuracy for some body movement. The estimation performance has been experimentally evaluated for four subjects sitting on the stool using our fabricated sensor. It is found that our proposed system can be achieved with the estimation error less than 2%.},   keywords={bioelectric potentials;biomedical measurement;body sensor networks;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;ultra wideband technology;stepped-FM ultra-wideband scheme;body movement;periodic chest movement;respiration;heartbeat sensing;heartbeat estimation scheme;noncontact heartbeat;heartbeat monitoring schemes;UWB sensor monitoring;chest movement;Heart rate variability;Monitoring;Estimation error;Diversity methods;Biomedical monitoring;body movement;frequency estimation;heart rate estimation;Stepped FM-UWB sensor},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355194},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Hypertension is a chronic disease causing risk of different types of disorders such as hypertension attacks, cerebrovascular attacks, kidney failure and cardiovascular diseases. To prevent such risks, statistics related to hypertension have to be monitored and analyzed in real time. Internet of Things (IoT) assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to monitor blood pressure and to diagnose the stage of hypertension in real time. In this paper, IoT-Fog based healthcare system is proposed for continuous monitoring and analysis of blood pressure statistics to predict hypertensive users. The proposed system initially identifies the stage of hypertension on the basis of user’s health parameters collected using IoT sensors at fog layer. After identifying the hypertensive stage, artificial neural network is used for predicting the risk level of hypertension attack in users at remote sites. The vital point of this paper is to continuously generate emergency alerts of blood pressure fluctuation from fog system to hypertensive users on their mobile phones. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user are stored on cloud storage for sharing with domain experts such as clinicians, doctors and personal caregivers. The temporal information generated from fog layer can be utilized for providing precautionary measures and suggestions well on time for patients’ wellness. Experimental results reveal that proposed framework achieves low response time, high accuracy and bandwidth efficiency.},   keywords={Hypertension;Sensors;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Hypertension;Fog-cloud Computing;Artifical Neural Network;Internet of Things (IoT).},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2871630},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support.

However, such technologies cannot recognize these gestures without prior training. Even for the same gesture, with different gesture amplitude may result in unsuccessful recognition. On the other hand, if we change the person to perform the same gesture, the algorithms also fails. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we propose an approach, which will be able to track the human body motion in real-time and also recognize complicated gestures.

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;polynomials;positron emission tomography;feature learning;multimodal stacked deep polynomial networks;Alzheimer disease diagnosis;mild cognitive impairment;multimodal neuroimaging data;magnetic resonance imaging;positron emission tomography;AD diagnosis;deep polynomial networks;deep learning algorithm;multimodal stacked DPN algorithm;MM-SDPN algorithm;feature representation;to fed high-level features;MRI;PET;ADNI dataset;binary classification;multiclass classification;state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithm;Neuroimaging;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Prediction algorithms;Diseases;Positron emission tomography;Alzheimer's disease;deep learning;deep polynomial networks;multimodal stacked deep polynomial networks;multimodal neuroimaging},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2017.2655720},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Jan},}

 title={A Fog-Based Healthcare Framework for Chikungunya}, 
  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={2},   pages={794-801},   abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multiorgan failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user's infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user's mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using temporal network analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision trees;diseases;graph theory;health care;mobile computing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;healthcare framework;Aedes agypti;healthcare services;fog-cloud technology;fog assisted healthcare system;decision tree;real-time healthcare data;Chikungunya virus infection;Chikungunya virus outbreak;fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system;Cloud computing;Sensors;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Pain;Decision trees;Chikungunya;cloud computing (CC);decision tree;fog computing (FOC);temporal network analysis (TNA)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Over the past 50 years, public health in Latin America has walked through significant changes on social and economic aspects. Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Latin America;geographical coverage;physical health stands;Latin American healthcare systems;Latin American governments;wearable technology adoption;healthcare wearable technology challenges;Internet of Medical Things;IoMT;healthcare wearable technology;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Government;Security;Public healthcare;Real-time systems;healthcare;wearable;IoMT;Latin-America;adoption;barriers;challenges},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399181},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

PalCom is an example of such a system that aims to enable interaction among pervasive services over heterogeneous networks. In this paper we discuss the need for providing networking-media independent messaging among pervasive devices, and identify the problem of designing a media abstraction framework for a pervasive middleware. We identify a number of design principles and features that need to be satisfied by such a framework. The most important of these principles is the separation of networking protocol aspects into abstraction representations, which are exposed in a unified format to upper layers of PalCom, and communication mechanisms which are hidden by media-specific implementations of our proposed media-abstraction framework for PalCom. Also, we explain our implementation and evaluation of that framework.},   keywords={middleware;multimedia computing;protocols;ubiquitous computing;media abstraction framework;pervasive middleware PalCom;pervasive middleware system;pervasive environment;pervasive services;heterogeneous network;networking-media independent messaging;pervasive devices;design principles;networking protocol aspect;abstraction representation;communication mechanism;media-specific implementation;media-abstraction framework;Media;Protocols;Abstracts;Network interfaces;Computer architecture;Middleware;Medical services;pervasive middleware;networking media abstraction;software framework},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.21},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

The thermal impact of sensors on human body has largely been a neglected topic. The paper rigorously analyzes the specific absorption rate (SAR) impact on human body.

Indicatively, telemedicine, real-time diagnosis and remote monitoring of patients, are expected to transform the healthcare domain. These systems may offer several services of different criticality, necessitating safety-/mission-critical core components and non-critical peripheral components; in other words, they are complex, mixed-criticality System-of-Systems (SoS). To understand and design such systems, engineers must be facilitated with the appropriate modeling tools. In this work, we explore the application of model-based design, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), of IoT e-Health systems, emphasizing criticality requirements. We focus on the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS) use case, combining IoT technologies with classic healthcare practices, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. Requirements comprise a basic concept of a systematic model-driven methodology that enables the successful management of the criticalities in system design, implementation and deployment. In the REMS use case, identified criticalities are modeled as SysML requirements, while SysML constraints and parametric diagrams are employed to describe and verify quantitative criticality requirements.},   keywords={cloud computing;formal specification;formal verification;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;SysML;systems analysis;mixed-criticality System-of-Systems;model-based design;Systems Modeling Language;Remote Elderly Monitoring System;IoT technologies;system design;SysML requirements;model-based approach;e-Health IoT Systems;Internet-based solutions;healthcare domain;modeling tools;model-driven methodology;healthcare practices;Internet of Things;cloud computing;criticality requirements management;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Senior citizens;Cloud computing;Unified modeling language;Databases;Internet of Things;Healthcare;Model-Driven Engineering;SysML;Remote Elderly Monitoring;Criticalities;Requirements},   doi={10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428764},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

By design, BLE supports short-range, single-hop communication between a pair of BLE devices. As such, native BLE does not allow network-based policy control or in-network functions for service enhancement. These limitations are impediments to any large-scale BLE based IoT deployment (e.g., in hospital environments), where such sophisticated network-based visibility and control may be required. Relying on cloud-based solutions to meet these requirements has many known shortcomings. This paper proposes an SDN-based architecture for enabling wide area IoT deployments using BLE devices at the edge. We introduce a programmable BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. BLESS can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller to enable flexible, policy-based switching, as well as various in-network operations in BLE networks.

Sharing data not only benefits these external parties but also the children themselves as solutions can be tailored to their needs. Because the My Smart Remote is for children, security and privacy concerns are paramount. A contribution of this concept that is primarily derived from the need for safety and security, and also efficiency in processing, is a solution where much of the sensor data of the My Smart Remote is processed locally, in addition to the cloud. This solution is based on the idea that smart solutions, such as smart cities and smart homes, generate a large amount of sensor data which can be more efficiently processed locally rather than depending on the cloud.

Bridging the gap between sensor nodes on the human body and the Internet becomes a challenging task in terms of reliable communications. Additionally, the systems will not only have to provide functionality, but also be highly secure.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={115-120},   abstract={Segmenting an image plays a crucial role in digital image processing. Segmentation depicts how the object is composed in an image and aids in extracting useful information from it so that interpretation becomes easier. Segmentation may be regarded as an essential pre-processing stage that will help to acquire objects that can be efficiently utilized in further steps of processing. This extraction of objects is helpful in almost every field today such as medical, forensic, industry and agriculture. Instead of using pixels, DWT make use of waves that helps to extract object efficiently. To raise the segmentation accuracy further an improved Fuzzy-C Mean with Edge and Local Information (FELICM) based gray stretch strategy is suggested that will help to segment an image by obtaining an optimistic and adaptive threshold by incorporating FELICM and gray stretch on coefficients with low frequency and edge enhancement on coefficients with high frequency after DWT. Existing and the proposed strategies have been compared using parameters Accuracy, Uniformity, Shape measurement and Regional Contrast.},   keywords={discrete wavelet transforms;edge detection;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;image enhancement;image segmentation;object detection;shape recognition;performance evaluation;image segmentation;improved FELICM based gray stretch;digital image processing;information extraction;object extraction;DWT;improved fuzzy-c mean with edge and local information;edge enhancement;low frequency coefficients;high frequency coefficients;parameter accuracy;shape measurement;regional contrast;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Shape measurement;Wavelet domain;Discrete wavelet transforms;Image Segmentation;Discrete Wavelet Transform;Thresholding FELICM},   doi={10.1109/INCITE.2016.7857601},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

A portable embedded system for taking photoacoustic measurements on tissues to estimate glucose concentration is implemented using field programmable gate array (FPGA). The back-end architecture for high-speed data acquisition and de-noising of photoacoustic measurements operates at 274.823 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. The glucose measurement technique is verified in vitro on glucose solutions and in vivo on tissues, with photoacoustic signal amplitude varying linearly with sample glucose concentration. A kernel-based regression algorithm using multiple features of the photoacoustic signal is used to estimate glucose concentration from photoacoustic measurements. The calibration algorithm provides a superior performance over previous efforts with a mean absolute relative difference of 8.84% and Clarke Error Grid distribution of 92.86% and 7.14% over Zones A and B of the grid.

In CS-MRI, we want to reconstruct a high-quality image from very few samples in a short time. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm, called projected iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (pISTA), and its acceleration pFISTA for CS-MRI image reconstruction. The proposed algorithms exploit sparsity of the magnetic resonance (MR) images under the redundant representation of tight frames. We prove that pISTA and pFISTA converge to a minimizer of a convex function with a balanced tight frame sparsity formulation. The pFISTA introduces only one adjustable parameter, the step size, and we provide an explicit rule to set this parameter. Numerical experiment results demonstrate that pFISTA leads to faster convergence speeds than the state-of-art counterpart does, while achieving comparable reconstruction errors. Moreover, reconstruction errors incurred by pFISTA appear insensitive to the step size.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;compressed sensing;image reconstruction;iterative methods;medical image processing;projected iterative soft-thresholding algorithm;compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging;high-quality image reconstruction;CS-MRI image reconstruction;convex function minimization;balanced tight frame sparsity formulation;numerical experiment;Analytical models;Image reconstruction;Algorithm design and analysis;Mathematical model;Magnetic resonance imaging;Dictionaries;Compressed sensing;iterative thresholding;MRI;sparse models;tight frames;Algorithms;Brain;Data Compression;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging},   doi={10.1109/TMI.2016.2550080},   ISSN={0278-0062},   month={Sept},}

Because the medical records in IoT-based hospital information system (HIS) are dispersedly obtained from distributed devices such as tablet computer, personal digital assistant, automated analyzer, and other medical devices, they are raw, simple, weak-content, and massive. Such medical records cannot be used for further analyzing and decision supporting due to that they are collected in a weak-semantic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enrich IoT-based medical records by linking them with the knowledge in linked open data.

In view of the scarcity of spectrum and the service requirements of traditional users, providing network access to the extremely large number of devices in IoT and M2M scenarios is one of the fundamental problems for network designers and operators. As a possible solution to this issue, this paper explores the possibility of using the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band for supporting M2M communications while co-existing with traditional users of this band. Since IEEE 802.11 or WiFi based networks are the most common networking technology in the ISM band, this paper presents an evaluation of “white spaces” in WiFi networks (i.e. periods where the WiFi network is not using the channel) that may be used opportunistically for M2M communications. Using a MMPP/G/1/K queue to model the operation of a WiFi access point, we characterize the WiFi white spaces in terms of their frequency, duration, and their probability distribution. Our results show that WiFi white spaces provide considerable transmission opportunities that may be exploited for M2M communications.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile radio;wireless LAN;exploiting white spaces;WiFi networks;opportunistic M2M communications;machine to machine communications;Internet of Things;service requirements;IoT;network designers;network operators;industrial scientific and medical;ISM;IEEE 802.11;MMPP/G/1/K queue;WiFi access point;White spaces;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Load modeling;Analytical models;Mathematical model;Protocols;Simulation;WiFi;white spaces;M2M communications},   doi={10.1109/LANMAN.2015.7114737},   ISSN={1944-0367},   month={April},}

Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection.

With limited computational power, BSN devices are often not able to provide strong security mechanisms to protect sensitive personal and health information, such as one's physiological data. Consequently, many new methods of securing Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been proposed recently. One effective solution is the Biometric Cryptosystem (BCS) approach. BCS exploits physiological and behavioral biometric traits, including face, iris, fingerprints, Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Photoplethysmography (PPG). In this paper, we propose a new BCS approach for securing wireless communications for wearable and implantable healthcare devices using gait signal energy variations and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework. By simultaneously extracting similar features from BSN sensors using our approach, binary keys can be generated on demand without user intervention. Through an extensive analysis on our BCS approach using a gait dataset, the results have shown that the binary keys generated using our approach have high entropy for all subjects. The keys can pass both NIST and Dieharder statistical tests with high efficiency. The experimental results also show the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of the similarity of intra-class keys and the discriminability of the inter-class keys.},   keywords={Sensors;Security;Wireless communication;Biometrics (access control);Wireless sensor networks;Servers;Communication system security;wearable security;gait biometrics;artificial neural network;data privacy;wireless communications;IoT security},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2018.2860780},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={},}

In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;health care;Internet of Things;medical control systems;medical information systems;patient monitoring;personal area networks;radiofrequency identification;telemedicine;Web services;wireless sensor networks;IoT-aware architecture;smart healthcare systems;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;wireless sensor network;smart mobile technologies;automatic patient monitoring;automatic patient tracking;biomedical devices;smart hospital system;constrained application protocol;low-power wireless personal area network infrastructure;representational state transfer network infrastructure;patient physiological parameters;ultralow-power hybrid sensing network;UHF RFID functionalities;control center;local users;remote users;REST web service;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Hospitals;Computer architecture;RFID;WSN;healthcare;Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP);healthcare;hybrid networks;radio frequency identification (RFID);representational state transfer (REST);6LoWPAN;smart environment;wireless sensor network (WSN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2417684},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

As the data keeps growing in complexity, users find it difficult to navigate and understand the relationships between the sets. There are limitations such as scalability and sub-optimal layouts being produced with the state-of-the-art visualization methods such as Euler diagrams, Treemap diagrams and ConSets. So, an effective visual method is in great need to produce an optimal layout and identify set properties with ease. This motivated us to develop a novel visual method called “Spherule diagrams” to improve the analysis of set relationships effectively. Then a small-scale user preference study was conducted to compare Euler diagrams with Spherule diagrams, where 80% participants preferred Spherule diagrams for its simplicity, navigation, better layout and set ordering characteristics. The other results based on error rate and rating, Spherule diagrams outperformed Euler diagrams.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={405-414},   abstract={Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The diagnosis of OSA requires an overnight sleep experiment in a laboratory. However, due to limitations in relation to the number of labs and beds available, patients often need to wait a long time before being diagnosed and eventually treated. In addition, the unfamiliar environment and restricted mobility when a patient is being tested with a polysomnogram may disturb their sleep, resulting in an incomplete or corrupted test. Therefore, it is posed that a PSG conducted in the patient's home would be more reliable and convenient. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the e-Health system. In this paper, we implement an IoT-based wireless polysomnography system for sleep monitoring, which utilizes a batterypowered, miniature, wireless, portable, and multipurpose recorder. A Java-based PSG recording program in the personal computer is designed to save several bio-signals and transfer them into the European data format. These PSG records can be used to determine a patient's sleep stages and diagnose OSA. This system is portable, lightweight, and has low power-consumption. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed PSG system, a comparison was made between the standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system. Several healthy volunteer patients participated in the PSG experiment and were monitored by both the standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system simultaneously, under the supervision of specialists at the Sleep Laboratory in Taipei Veteran General Hospital. A comparison of the results of the time-domain waveform and sleep stage of the two systems shows that the proposed system is reliable and can be applied in practice. The proposed system can facilitate the long-term tracing and research of personal sleep monitoring at home.},   keywords={biomechanics;biomedical measurement;electroencephalography;electro-oculography;Internet of Things;Java;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;sleep;PSG system;standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System;healthy volunteer patients;PSG experiment;Sleep Laboratory;sleep stage;personal sleep monitoring;IoT;wireless polysomnography intelligent system;obstructive sleep apnea;overnight sleep experiment;patient;e-Health system;wireless polysomnography system;PSG recording program;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Standards;Wireless communication;Software;Polysomnography (PSG);JAVA;Internet of Things;wireless;sleep monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2765702},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Towards a Physiologically-Aware Architecture for Transmission of Biomedical Signals in BASNs/IoT}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The continued growth and popularity of IoT-based wearables coupled with wireless body area sensor network (BASN) communication architectures continues to gain widespread adoption for e-Health applications. Challenges facing the adoption of this vision require e- Health communication architectures for wearable IoT/BASNs to make effective use of bandwidth, energy stores for extended continuous transmission of physiological data, mitigation of computational burden when analyzing the data in the cloud at a global scale and, most importantly, ensuring the features of clinical significance in the biomedical signal are not compromised. In this paper, we present a novel physiologically-aware communication architecture to address these challenges for wearable IoT/BASNs for e-Health applications. The architecture works by extracting patient health state using local in-node pre-diagnosis (or pre-screening) to help guide the operation of the communication architecture in deciding when data should be transmitted, its type and format, and given quality. This latter property on preserving signal 'quality' is central to the architecture, which employs a feature-based diagnostic distortion measure to ensure retention of features of clinical significance during source coding in order to guarantee their reconstruction; a notion which carries greater emphasis for biomedical signals as opposed to ordinary multimedia signals. Simulation work of the architecture is presented in MATLAB using Electrocardiograph (ECG) signals from PhysioNet's ECG database, where it is demonstrated energy savings are realized by a factor of 30 with a reduction in biomedical data volume as high as 86% for tested cases while preserving clinical features.},   keywords={body area networks;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;physiologically-aware architecture;biomedical signal;BASNs/IoT;IoTbased wearables;wireless body area sensor network communication architectures;BASN;e-Health applications;wearable IoT/BASNs;physiological data;clinical significance;patient health state;in-node pre-diagnosis;feature-based diagnostic distortion measure;biomedical data volume;clinical features;signal quality;multimedia signals;electrocardiograph signals;health communication architectures;physiologically-aware communication architecture;Distortion measurement;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Distortion;Biomedical monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422796},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

 title={Balanced Energy Consumption Based Adaptive Routing for IoT Enabling Underwater WSNs}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={10040-10051},   abstract={Applications of Internet of Things underwater wireless sensor networks, such as imaging underwater life, environmental monitoring, and supervising geological processes on the ocean floor, demand a prolonged network lifetime. However, these networks face many challenges, such as high path loss, limited available bandwidth, limited battery power, and high attenuation. For a longer network lifetime, both balanced and efficient energy consumption are equally important. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, called balanced energy adaptive routing (BEAR), to prolong the lifetime of UWSNs. The proposed BEAR protocol operates in three phases: 1) initialization phase; 2) tree construction phase; and 3) data transmission phase. In the initialization phase, all nodes share information related to their residual energy level and location. In the tree construction phase, our proposed BEAR exploits the location information for: a) selecting neighbour nodes and b) choosing the facilitating and successor nodes based on the value of cost function. In order to balance the energy consumption among the successor and the facilitator nodes, BEAR chooses nodes with relatively higher residual energy than the average residual energy of the network. The results of our extensive simulations show that BEAR outperforms its counterpart protocols in terms of network lifetime.},   keywords={energy consumption;Internet of Things;marine communication;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;cost function;facilitator nodes;successor nodes;neighbour nodes;residual energy level;data transmission phase;tree construction phase;initialization phase;BEAR protocol;UWSN;balanced energy adaptive routing protocol;prolonged network lifetime;geological processes;ocean floor;environmental monitoring;underwater wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;IoT enabling underwater WSN;balanced energy consumption;Energy consumption;Routing;Routing protocols;Distributed Bragg reflectors;Reliability;Throughput;IoT;underwater wireless sensor network;energy balancing;tree construction},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2706741},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},   keywords={channel capacity;electromagnetic interference;game theory;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;Internet of vehicles;e-health applications;electromagnetic interference;EMI;power control algorithm;noncooperative game theoretic framework;channel capacity;best-response-dynamics algorithm;network-level optimal capacity;mobile hospital;Games;Electromagnetic interference;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Hospitals;Mobile handsets;E-health;game theory;mobile hospital;Nash equilibrium;power control},   doi={10.1109/JSYST.2015.2441720},   ISSN={1932-8184},   month={Sept},}

With elderly people as the main target, these conservative users pose a serious challenge to the successful implementation of smart home healthcare services. The objective of this research was to develop and test a theoretical framework empirically for determining the core factors that can affect the elderly users' acceptance of smart home services for healthcare. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people aged 55 years and above across four Asian countries. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the effect of eight hypothesized predicting constructs. The user perceptions were measured on a conceptual level rather than the actual usage intention toward a specific service. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, expert advice, and perceived trust have a positive impact on the behavioral intention. The same association is negative for technology anxiety and perceived cost. Facilitating conditions and social influence do not have any effect on the behavioral intention. The model could explain 81.4% of the total variance in the dependent variable i.e., behavioral intention. Effort expectancy is the leading predictor of smart homes for healthcare acceptance among the elderly. Together with expert advice, perceived trust, and perceived cost, these four factors represent the key influence of the elderly peoples' acceptance behavior.

This study suggests a model to transmit and manage patients' health and medical information safely through authorization in the IoT environment. Different with preceding studies that focus on saving patient information on the servers or improving access control, the proposed model considers threats related to process of patent information with efficiency. This study introduces a model where patients authorize representatives, who will be authenticated by hospitals, to transfer information to other hospitals safely for security, practicality, and efficiency. Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository. The advantage of this model is that it does not allow staff members or hospitals to collect information without patient's consent and thus reduces the risk of leaking patients' sensitive personal information to other places as the Token Repository saves nothing but the Access Token.},   keywords={authorisation;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patents;trusted computing;secure patient information transfer;delegated authorization;IoT equipment;health information safely;medical information safely;access control;patent information;hospitals;delegated user trusted;token repository;healthcare;Internet of Things;Security;Delegation;Medical Information;Healthcare},   doi={10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763434},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={12},   number={4},   pages={762-773},   abstract={Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is one of the main under-diagnosed sleep disorder. It is an aggravating factor for several serious cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. There is, however, a lack of medical devices for long-term ambulatory monitoring of OSA since current systems are rather bulky, expensive, intrusive, and cannot be used for long-term monitoring in ambulatory settings. In this paper, we propose a wearable, accurate, and energy efficient system for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea on a long-term basis. As an embedded system for Internet of Things, it reduces the gap between home health-care and professional supervision. Our approach is based on monitoring the patient using a single-channel electrocardiogram signal. We develop an efficient time-domain analysis to meet the stringent resources constraints of embedded systems to compute the sleep apnea score. Our system, for a publicly available database (PhysioNet Apnea-ECG), has a classification accuracy of up to 88.2% for our new online and patient-specific analysis, which takes the distinct profile of each patient into account. While accurate, our approach is also energy efficient and can achieve a battery lifetime of 46 days for continuous screening of OSA.},   keywords={body sensor networks;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;embedded systems;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;sleep;time-domain analysis;medical wearable sensors;obstructive sleep apnea;OSA;sleep disorder;serious cardiovascular diseases;medical devices;long-term ambulatory monitoring;current systems;long-term monitoring;ambulatory settings;wearable energy efficient;long-term basis;embedded system;efficient time-domain analysis;sleep apnea score;PhysioNet Apnea-ECG;new online patient-specific analysis;online obstructive sleep apnea detection;accurate energy efficiency;time 46.0 d;Electrocardiography;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Batteries;Feature extraction;Wearable sensors;Long-term monitoring;Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA);Online detection;Real-time classification;Wearable sensor},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2824659},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={Aug},}

Optimizing such circuits for lowest power consumption while maximize functionality and performance is key for successful implementation of such circuits in the IoT systems. IoT devices are diverse in nature but are typically constrained by limited power availability, limited area budget and the need for modularity of design. The burden of ultra-low-power budget unfortunately doesn't necessarily mean that other performance requirements are relaxed. The tutorial is therefore geared towards designers of IoT devices including sensors, MEMS, mobile devices, medical sensors, wireless communication devices, near field communication devices, energy harvesting designs, mobile devices, and wireless communication devices. It will focus on how automated circuit sizing and tuning methodologies can be used to enhance existing design expertise to reduce power consumption while trade-off with other circuit performances. Additionally it will be shown how features like circuit sensitivity analysis can be used for confirming design hypotheses. Using such a verification and optimization environment can help systematically and fully explore design's operating, design and statistical design space.},   keywords={circuit optimisation;electronic design automation;electronics industry;Internet of Things;low-power electronics;power consumption;sensitivity analysis;circuit sensitivity analysis;tuning methodologies;automated circuit sizing;energy harvesting designs;wireless communication devices;mobile devices;IoT systems;electronics industry;Internet of Things;low power circuit optimization;Performance evaluation;Circuit optimization;Power demand;Sensors;Mobile handsets;Wireless communication;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/SOCC.2017.8225982},   ISSN={2164-1706},   month={Sept},}

However, disaster operations require real-time and low latency data communication, especially live video and audio streaming, as well as in integration with social networks. Thus, deployed tactical networks face several challenges to connect intervening teams. To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In our recent works, a new routing protocol called ORACE-Net was proposed, evaluated and compared to the existing approaches.

Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external recognition.

The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'.

 title={OCTOPIA: An Observant-Clinician and Touchable-Patient Integrated Architecture}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={287-293},   abstract={It is time for clinician to be more elegant in diagnosis, and at the same time the patient to be taken care of in an all-round way. The improving and opening of the health and medical data, as well as the wide use of the environment and the human body sensors, gives us the opportunity to do so. This paper proposes an "observant clinician and touchable patient" integrated architecture (OCTOPIA), which is for both clinician and patient and extendible. On the basis of integrated medical knowledge, human health and environmental data, OCTOPIA interacts with the patient in a heuristic way to analyze the patient's symptoms and likely diseases. Then, comprehensive data information will be presented to the clinician. In all key links, clinicians will have the opportunity to use their own experience to influence the final diagnosis. Broadly, OCTOPIA consists of five major components: data capture, symptom-disease graph, QA system, ranking likely diseases and visualization. This paper proposes an architecture integrating the environment and human body information, and presents the solutions of an interactive QA system for symptom, a multi-factor calculation model for disease and a visualization design.

The future Internet will be capable of connecting &amp;amp; communicating with almost all physical and virtual objects around us to the existing Internet. The Internet of Things is a vision that entails connectivity among different physical and virtual objects in order to understand how the life would change when things, homes and cities become smart. In this sense, IoT is an integral part of the `future Internet' that counsels individuals, public and private organizations, research and educational institutes about how the `smart things' can be active participants in business, information and social processes by interacting with themselves and with the environment. Thus `smart things' are expected to exchange/process the sensed data, while reacting autonomously to the events with or without any human intervention and self configuring themselves. The application domain of IoT is spreading out over the time. To name a few, IoT would revolutionize fields such as telemedicine (or the future `medical tourism'), irrigation, smart buildings &amp;amp; industries, ecommerce, auto vehicle systems, monitoring &amp;amp; surveillance, etc. However, all these charismatic and pleasing aspects of IoT can be envisioned in reality only if a `well-defined' standard can be constituted that could deal with the complexity, size, security, privacy, time, cost, peaceful co-existence and better integration among the things/objects, and the socio-economic implications.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},   keywords={Medical services;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Servers;Prototypes;Senior citizens;Wireless communication;Context-aware data forwarding strategy;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);named data networking of things;NDN;NDNoT.},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723843},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={},}

This process is very time consuming and prone to human errors, especially for large scale hospitals. As a solution, an Internet of Things (IoT) based pulmonary monitoring system was proposed. The system uses a single-lead heart rate sensor connected to a microcontroller that is plugged to a computer that has an application which is capable of processing pulmonary rates by passing the data to a C# and MATLAB program and plotting waveforms from the derivation of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings (ECG-Derived Respiration or EDR), and forward the information to the Internet to be stored in a database. The collected information can be viewed in a website and accessed by relevant individuals (doctors and patient's relative). The critical value generated from the t-test is 1.701 and 2.048 for the one-tail and two-tail test, respectively. These values lie in the non-critical region indicating that there was no significant difference between the two sample sets. The average percent difference between the EDR rates is 4.1362%.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Phrase search allows retrieval of documents containing an exact phrase, which plays an important role in many machine learning applications for cloud-based IoT, such as intelligent medical data analytics. In order to protect sensitive information from being leaked by service providers, documents (e.g., clinic records) are usually encrypted by data owners before being outsourced to the cloud. This, however, makes the search operation an extremely challenging task. Existing searchable encryption schemes for multi-keyword search operations fail to perform phrase search, as they are unable to determine the location relationship of multiple keywords in a queried phrase over encrypted data on the cloud server side. In this paper, we propose P3, an efficient privacy-preserving phrase search scheme for intelligent encrypted data processing in cloud-based IoT. Our scheme exploits the homomorphic encryption and bilinear map to determine the location relationship of multiple queried keywords over encrypted data. It also utilizes a probabilistic trapdoor generation algorithm to protect users’ search patterns. Thorough security analysis demonstrates the security guarantees achieved by P3. We implement a prototype and conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The evaluation results show that compared with existing multi-keyword search schemes, P3 can greatly improve the search accuracy with moderate overheads.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Indexes;Servers;Privacy;Encryption;Phrase search;encrypted data;artificial intelligence;IoT;cloud.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2871607},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The explosive growth in home, wearable, and wireless devices has not been matched by the growth in radio spectrum bands to accommodate them. The inter-networking of all of these devices known as “the internet of things (IoT)” is expected to have tens of billions of devices, mostly wireless, definitely incurring a coexistence or interference problem. The ubiquitous industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio band at 2.4GHz, in particular, one of the candidate band for IoT is heavily oversubscribed due to its unlicensed nature and could become all but unusable for priority systems in a densely populated area in the future at the present rate of growth of 2.4GHz transmitters and networks. In our study, the communications of the “last 100 meters” of an IoT network, i.e., from devices to an access point (AP) are considered.

These objects can be humans, animals, or simple artefacts. Many important and critical applications such as surveillance or health care require some form of (human) activity recognition. Existing languages can be used to describe models of activities, but they are difficult to master by non computer scientists (ex: doctors). In this paper, we present a new language dedicated to end users, to describe their activities. We call it ADeL (Activity Description Language). This language is intended to be part of a complete recognition system. Such a system has to be real time, reactive, correct, and dependable. We choose the synchronous approach because it respects these characteristics, it ensures determinism and safe parallel composition, and it allows verification of systems using model-checking.

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme.},   keywords={Medical services;Privacy;Sensors;Energy consumption;Energy harvesting;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Internet of Things;healthcare systems;mobile edge offloading;energy harvesting;privacy;reinforcement learning.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2875926},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.},   keywords={authorisation;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;message authentication;prosthetics;authorized medical personnel;IMD security;IMD threat model;IMD access control schemes;implantable medical devices;electronic devices;online authentication;zero power authentication;Access control;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Authentication;US Government agencies;Access control;implantable medical devices (IMDs);survey},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2708042},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

 title={Privacy-Aware Blind Cloud Framework for Advanced Healthcare}, 
  year={2017},   volume={21},   number={11},   pages={2492-2495},   abstract={This letter proposes a novel privacy-aware “<italic>blind</italic>” cloud infrastructure to be utilized for storage, processing, and organization of health data. Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Servers;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Hospitals;Delays;Cloud computing;privacy;blindness;wireless body area networks (WBANs);Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141},   ISSN={1089-7798},   month={Nov},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={3},   pages={2071-2084},   abstract={Tracking human sleeping postures and vital signs of breathing and heart rates during sleep is important as it can help to assess the general physical health of a person and provide useful clues for diagnosing possible diseases. Traditional approaches (e.g., polysomnography) are limited to clinic usage. Recent radio frequency-based approaches require specialized devices or dedicated wireless sensors and are only able to track breathing rate. In this paper, we propose to track the vital signs of both breathing rate and heart rate during sleep by using off-the-shelf WiFi without any wearable or dedicated devices. Our system reuses existing WiFi network and exploits the fine-grained channel information to capture the minute movements caused by breathing and heart beats. Our system thus has the potential to be widely deployed and perform continuous long-term monitoring. The developed algorithm makes use of the channel information in both time and frequency domain to estimate breathing and heart rates, and it works well when either individual or two persons are in bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can accurately capture vital signs during sleep under realistic settings, and achieve comparable or even better performance comparing to traditional and existing approaches, which is a strong indication of providing noninvasive, continuous fine-grained vital signs monitoring without any additional cost.},   keywords={biomedical communication;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;sleep;wireless LAN;heart rates;sleep;WiFi signals;human sleeping postures;breathing rate;heart rate;wearable devices;WiFi network;heart beats;vital signs;physical health;WiFi;Monitoring;Wireless fidelity;Heart rate;Sensors;Sleep apnea;Biomedical monitoring;Channel state information (CSI);sleep monitoring;vital signs;WiFi},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2822818},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

This services include teleECG, teleRadiology and teleUSG which utilize mobile technology. In Indonesia, there is a tendency that IoT will be implemented on a large scale. Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to experience deficiency of 500 MHz mobile spectrum in 2020. Therefore, the calculation of spectrum for telemedicine services is urgently needed. This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia.

It can be used to sense, detect and predict the health condition of the patient. The sensors or actuators attached to the patient will spot out the changes taking place in their body. These details are collected and sent to the databases after undergoing certain stages of processing. The information which gets stored in the database or end systems can be retrieved and utilized whenever it is necessary. Based on those particulars, diagnosis can be performed in an efficient way and as a result the Doctor will be able to provide the appropriate treatment. This method of transformation of the health care services using the Internet of Things can be extended to the next level by implementing it in the rural areas where even the basic medical facilities are denied.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={291-295},   abstract={Diabetes mellitus, known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders and has affected hundreds of millions of people. The detection of diabetes is of great importance, concerning its severe complications. There have been plenty of research studies about diabetes identification, many of which are based on the Pima Indian diabetes data set. It's a data set studying women in Pima Indian population started from 1965, where the onset rate for diabetes is comparatively high. Most of the research studies done before mainly focused on one or two particular complex technique to test the data, while a comprehensive research over many common techniques is missing. In this paper, we make a comprehensive exploration to the most popular techniques (e.g. DNN (Deep Neural Network), SVM (Support Vector Machine), etc.) used to identify diabetes and data preprocessing methods. Basically, we examine these techniques by the accuracy of cross-validation on the Pima Indian data set. We compare the accuracy of each classifier over several ways of data preprocessors and we modify the parameters to improve their accuracy. The best technique we find has 77.86% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation. We also analyze the relevance between each feature with the classification result.},   keywords={diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines;comprehensive exploration;diabetes identification;diabetes mellitus;research studies;Pima Indian diabetes data;studying women;Pima Indian population;particular complex technique;comprehensive research;Pima Indian data;data preprocessors;DNN;Deep Neural Network;SVM;Support Vector Machine;Diabetes;Support vector machines;Decision trees;Machine learning;Neural networks;Training;Sugar;machine learning;deep neural network;classification;diabetes identification},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355130},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

 title={Towards u-health: An indoor 6LoWPAN based platform for real-time healthcare monitoring}, 
  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;real-time healthcare monitoring;ubiquitous healthcare;u-healthcare systems;bluetooth;Zigbee;smart devices;IEEE802.15.4;interoperability problem;communication platform;next generation u-healthcare system;edge router;real-time monitoring;gateway application;TCP client;remote PC;TCP/IP;Internet of Things;Labview program;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Real-time systems;Protocols;Accelerometers;Temperature sensors;6LoWPAN;U-Healthcare;WSN;WBAN;IEEE802.15.4},   doi={10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Hence it is necessary to develop a common framework for accident detection, avoiding secondary accidents, timely alert of first responder and optimizing the traffic for the first responder (ambulance). In our approach we combine emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and VANET to propose a framework for accident alerting and traffic optimization for ambulances Our approach provides reliable, autonomous framework which allows vehicles, ambulances, and hospitals to establish and maintain their network themselves.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={367-372},   abstract={Here a work in progress is reported on within research that aims to obtain knowledge about variables which may influence a hospital emergency department's performance and quality of service. Knowledge discovery will be achieved through the analysis of intensive data generated by the simulation of any possible scenario in the real system. The challenge is to provide knowledge of critical, non-usual or extreme situations. Simulation is the only way to obtain information about these kinds of situations, as it is not possible to test such scenarios in the real system. We show how simulation of the real system through advanced computing is a source of big data, as it allows rapid and massive data generation. The potential of high performance computing makes it possible to generate a very large amount of data within a reasonable time, store this data, then process and analyze it to obtain knowledge. We describe the methodology proposed for this goal, which is based on the use of the simulator as a sensor of the real system, and so as the main source of data. The application of data mining techniques will open the doors to knowledge. To verify that the proposed methodology works, we propose a case study in which the aim is to obtain knowledge from a set of data already available, obtained from the simulation of a reduced set of scenarios of the real system.},   keywords={Big Data;data mining;digital simulation;medical information systems;big data;quality of service;knowledge discovery;data mining techniques;hospital emergency department;simulation;Data models;Data mining;Computational modeling;Hospitals;Analytical models;Big data;Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS);Big Data;Data Mining (DM);Decision Support Systems (DSS);Emergency Department (ED);Knowledge Discovery},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.65},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={20596-20608},   abstract={Due to the significant advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare sector, the security, and the integrity of the medical data became big challenges for healthcare services applications. This paper proposes a hybrid security model for securing the diagnostic text data in medical images. The proposed model is developed through integrating either 2-D discrete wavelet transform 1 level (2D-DWT-1L) or 2-D discrete wavelet transform 2 level (2D-DWT-2L) steganography technique with a proposed hybrid encryption scheme. The proposed hybrid encryption schema is built using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard, and Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman algorithms. The proposed model starts by encrypting the secret data; then it hides the result in a cover image using 2D-DWT-1L or 2D-DWT-2L. Both color and gray-scale images are used as cover images to conceal different text sizes. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated based on six statistical parameters; the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), structural similarity (SSIM), structural content (SC), and correlation. The PSNR values were relatively varied from 50.59 to 57.44 in case of color images and from 50.52 to 56.09 with the gray scale images. The MSE values varied from 0.12 to 0.57 for the color images and from 0.14 to 0.57 for the gray scale images. The BER values were zero for both images, while SSIM, SC, and correlation values were ones for both images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model proved its ability to hide the confidential patient's data into a transmitted cover image with high imperceptibility, capacity, and minimal deterioration in the received stego-image.},   keywords={data encapsulation;discrete wavelet transforms;error statistics;health care;image coding;image colour analysis;Internet of Things;mean square error methods;medical information systems;steganography;confidential patient;transmitted cover image;received stego-image;BER values;MSE values;gray scale images;color images;PSNR values;structural content;gray-scale images;secret data;model starts;Advanced Encryption Standard;hybrid encryption scheme;2D-DWT-2L;integrating either 2-D discrete;medical images;diagnostic text data;hybrid security model;healthcare services applications;big challenges;integrity;healthcare sector;significant advancement;healthcare systems;IoT;secure medical data transmission model;text sizes;SSIM;PSNR;peak signal-to-noise ratio;mean square error;MSE;bit error rate;BER;structural similarity;Encryption;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Data models;Cryptography;DWT-1level;DWT-2level;encryption;healthcare services;Internet of Things;medical images;steganography},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817615},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This paper presents the design and implementation of “eMedicare” for those who take medications without continuous professional supervision. Electronic dispensing systems are eHealth drug storage devices that electronically dispense medications in a programmed fashion and track medication use. eMedicare acts as watchdog for medication usage. eMedicare can track the missed medications doses. It notifies the patients through beating an alarm, or through a phone call or updating data on the server. Live data is updated in the server for each dose at the scheduled time with help of Internet of Things (IoT)[3].

It depends strongly on the doctors' long-term experience as well as on their different inferences. Being subjective and based on long-term experience, pulse detection methods are difficult to standardize. Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD), established by Wei Jin, is an efficient method validated by both traditional Chinese medicine and in recent years also by western medicine. The key step to automatic implementation of KPD, using signal processing and analysis, is the developed KPD signal acquisition device. However, the raw wrist pulse signal acquired from KPD device includes a significant amount of noise. This paper proposes several preprocessing algorithms for pulse diagnosis, that includes wavelet transform and Gaussian filter to remove noise and the iterative sliding window (ISW) algorithm to remove the baseline wander and split the continuous signal into single periods. Experimental results show, that the algorithm for baseline wander removal is efficient and that the segmented signal matches the signal described in KPD.},   keywords={filtering theory;Gaussian processes;health care;iterative methods;medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;signal denoising;wavelet transforms;traditional Chinese medicine;wrist pulse diagnosis;KPD signal acquisition device;wavelet transform;Gaussian filter;noise removal;iterative sliding window;segmented signal;continuous signal;window algorithm;raw wrist pulse signal;signal processing;western medicine;kim pulse diagnosis;pulse detection methods;health status;KPD based signal preprocessing algorithm;Wrist;Algorithm design and analysis;Wavelet transforms;Adaptive filters;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering algorithms;preprocessing algorithm;Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD);e-noising;terative sliding window (ISW)},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2016.75},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={E-health represents one of the most promising Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Indeed, it enhances the traditional medical services by monitoring periodically patient's health information. Due to the sensitivity of exchanged medical data, strong and efficient security and privacy protocols must be deployed. However, existing privacy preserving approaches either cannot achieve a high level of privacy, or have an important computation and/ or storage overheads. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving e-health system, achieving patient privacy and better meeting the IoT environment requirements. This system includes a new cryptographic scheme called KE-IBE which relies on Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) and resolves its key escrow issue. To prove that the proposed protocol can withstand various known attacks, we perform an informal security analysis. To assess the performance of our proposal, we implement it and expose the experiments simulation results. This evaluation shows that the proposed system is highly efficient in comparison to related approaches found in literature and that it achieves privacy with an acceptable running time.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;telecommunication security;informal security analysis;IoT e-health systems;privacy-preserving e-health system;cryptographic scheme;Internet of Things;medical services;medical data exchange;key escrow identity-based encryption scheme;protocols;KE-IBE;identity-based cryptograph;IBC;Privacy;Encryption;Identity-based encryption;Medical services;Internet of Things;E-Health;Security;Privacy;Key escrow;Identity-based Cryptography},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2018.8319218},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={134-139},   abstract={In this paper, we propose a framework that caters for diabetic patients in the UAE. The system integrates a small and lightweight wearable device in the form of a watch with a mobile application to aid in the analysis of blood glucose level. Diabetes is considered a challenge for both the medical expert and the patient. Currently, the existing devices utilised by diabetic people are bulky and not portable. The inconvenience of such devices creates the need to propose a compact and reliable solution to measure the glucose level in the blood. The multipurpose user-friendly features of the accompanying mobile application presents users with a glycemic index calculator based on user-inputted recipes. Moreover, it predicts the blood glucose level trends upon consumption of certain ingredients and based on earlier trends and presents them to the user in the form of time-stamped graphs; ensuring that the patient is aware of his glucose levels. Furthermore, users are informed to take their medications on predefined intervals through push notifications. The device itself is designed to function as a colour-coded blood glucose indicator that ranges from very high to very low. To prove the efficiency of our system, we tested the device on patients with different glucose levels. Our results validate the usefulness of this framework to a function as a means of awareness and detection of the glucose level in the blood.},   keywords={Sugar;Blood;Diabetes;Strips;Biomedical monitoring;Indexes;Mobile applications;Diabetes, Glycemic Index, Blood Glucose, and Wearable Devices},   doi={10.1109/W-FiCloud.2018.00027},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

This research presents an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework to sustain the interoperability between stakeholders within an information system by applying Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) paradigm and ontology. The major contribution of this research is building software model which is annotated with semantic model to maintain the comprehension between the modelers and the programmers allowing sustainability by adapting to the changing environment. Moreover, the framework offers two types of semantic validation i.e. model and data of the documents to integrate sensor data which we claim as a novelty in this study.

However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective.

The migration of data processing from local node, achieved by decoupling the node hardware from the required processing capabilities, is only possible through implementations of network softwarization. The softwarization which brings, new services that are executed remotely has led to security challenges, yet to be resolved, due to the increasing amount of data being continually exchanged between the sensor node-hub and the remote servers. In this regard we introduce a novel genetic algorithm for data security with a powerful security architecture that performs one-time key, single block enciphering instead of a block chaining or weak stream enciphering. The algorithm architecture produces variable (stealthy) keys and data that adopts white noise statistical behavior, therefore, having high immunity to cryptanalysis. The algorithm combines gene fusion and Horizontal Gene Transfer inspired from the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. A Salt extracted from the data block hash-value adds the stealthy-key feature to the cipher.

Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={147-152},   abstract={In today's world, the rapid advancement of technology allows us to find new solutions to old problems in critical areas, namely patient and staff tracking in healthcare facilities. The medical staff within these facilities are in an environment where they depend on immediately knowing the location of a patient or other medical staff. McAllister et al. [1] proposed a solution named LoCATE (Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment) which uses existing technology to track all patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current wireless networks (e.g., WiFi) within a healthcare facility by using edge node technology as its tracking solution. It can locate an object within three to five feet of its calculated position. The ubiquity of WiFi infrastructure in healthcare facilities makes it an attractive option to use, as the backbone for a patient and staff tracking system. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge nodes create security holes in networks and leak data to the open world. This paper aims to analyze what security holes and data leaks LoCATE creates in a healthcare facility. In this paper, we show the dangers of using simple and default passwords, the need to physically secure edge nodes, and the importance of securing data before transmission. We exploit the system's weak security measures by forging edge node data, gaining unauthorized access, performing denial of service attack, and launching other attacks. We analyze the successfulness of these attacks to offer mitigation techniques for future devices located in other critical areas similar to the healthcare facilities.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;health care;indoor radio;Internet of Things;wireless LAN;medical staff;edge node technology;tracking solution;security holes;physically secure edge nodes;healthcare facilities;data leaks;security analysis;IoT system;indoor localization;LoCATE;localization-of-health center assets-through-an-IoT environment;wireless networks;WiFi infrastructure;staff tracking system;patient tracking system;weak security measures;denial-of-service attack;Medical services;Wireless fidelity;Databases;Password;Wireless communication;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);Localization;Raspberry Pi;security},   doi={10.1109/SIEDS.2018.8374726},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={There are tremendous security concerns with patient health monitoring sensors in Internet of Things (IoT). The concerns are also realized by recent sophisticated security and privacy attacks, including data breaching, data integrity, and data collusion. Conventional solutions often offer security to patients’ health monitoring data during the communication. However, they often fail to deal with complicated attacks at the time of data conversion into cipher and after the cipher transmission. In this paper, we first study privacy and security concerns with healthcare data acquisition and then transmission. Then, we propose a secure data collection scheme for IoT based healthcare system named SecureData with the aim to tackle security concerns similar to the above. SecureData scheme is comprised of four layers: IoT network sensors/devices, Fog layers, Cloud computing layer, and healthcare provider layer. We mainly contribute to the first three layers. For the first two layers, SecureData includes two techniques: light-weight FPGA hardware-based cipher algorithm and secret cipher share algorithm, respectively. We study KATAN algorithm and we implement and optimize it on the FPGA hardware platform, while we use the idea of secret cipher sharing technique to protect patients’ data privacy. At the cloud computing layer, we apply a distributed database technique that includes a number of cloud data servers to guarantee patients’ personal data privacy at the cloud computing layer. The performance of SecureData is validated through simulations with FPGA in terms of hardware frequency rate, energy cost, and computation time of all the algorithms and the results show that SecureData can be efficient when applying for protecting security risks in IoT-based healthcare.},   keywords={Medical services;Ciphers;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Data collection;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;data collection;hardware-based security;threats;secret cipher;privacy;healthcare.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2854714},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

By using ISODC clustering search decision-making ability, the best threshold value is obtained. ISODC can solve the dilemma that PCNN needs to determine appropriate model parameters and circulation iterations. ISODC-PCNN makes use of the grey level of the image to cluster, and then uses the improved ISODATA to determine the initial number and the center of clustering which can be used as the optimal threshold value of PCNN.

To date, there is still a lack of routing standards for such networks. Indeed, in such harsh environment, medical rescue teams, firefighters, military, police and even victims need to be steadily connected to a distant command center (CC) which conducts the rescue operations. In this paper, we propose a new multi-hop routing approach called ORACE-Net. The proposed protocol uses advertisement packets to establish routes from deployed nodes towards the CC (i.e. Direct Route Establishment). Then, it utilizes the data packets to establish reverse routes (from the CC to all nodes in the network). We implemented and evaluated our approach in realistic scenario using tactical and on-body mobile nodes. Our experiments include also an Internet of Thing (IoT) platform and a real-time dynamic topology website which are used for analyzing the behavior of the protocol. The experimental results show that our protocol increases the mobile nodes connectivity and packet delivery rate. Also, it reduces the average round trip time delay for the on-body nodes compared to the tactical deployed base stations.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;routing protocol;tactical mobile ad-hoc networks;wireless communication networks;distant command center;multihop routing;ORACE-Net;Internet of Thing;IoT;Routing protocols;Routing;Ad hoc networks;Smart phones;Spread spectrum communication;Estimation;Tactical Multi-Hop Routing Protocol;Ad-hoc Wifi;Internet of Things;Optimized Routing Approach for Critical and Emergency Networks},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763188},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales.

Power management is very important factor in considering WSN's and it has been demonstrated that communication cost is higher than the computational as nodes consume most of the energy in communication. Added to the fact that sensors could be closely deployed and report the same reading, the data aggregation concept was introduced to resolve those issues and for the sake of better performance at a reduced cost. Nonetheless, sensing devices are prone to failure due to several aspects such as node failure or low batteries as well as being compromised.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={720-725},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage.

Dependency to the history is one of the measures to examine the strength of a randomness source. In dependency to the history, the adversary has infinite access to the history of generated random bits from the source and wants to predict the next random number based on that. Although many physiological signals have been proposed in literature as good source of randomness, no dependency to history analysis has been carried out to examine this fact. In this paper, using a large dataset of physiological signals collected from PhysioNet, the dependency to history of Interpuls Interval (IPI), QRS Complex, and EEG signals (including Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma and Theta waves) were examined. The results showed that despite the general assumption that the physiological signals are random, all of them are weak sources of randomness with high dependency to their history. Among them, Alpha wave of EEG signal shows a much better randomness and is a good candidate for post-processing and randomness extraction algorithm.},   keywords={cryptography;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;random number generation;telecommunication security;physiological signal;generation cryptographic key;good source;randomness source;generated random bits;random number;EEG signal;Randomness;Entropy;Santha-Vazirani Source;Implants;Physiological Signals},   doi={10.1049/cp.2018.0027},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong per-slice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled “switch node”, called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices.

  year={2018},   volume={15},   number={2},   pages={761-773},   abstract={The medical industry is increasingly digitalized and Internet-connected (e.g., Internet of Medical Things), and when deployed in an Internet of Medical Things environment, software-defined networks (SDNs) allow the decoupling of network control from the data plane. There is no debate among security experts that the security of Internet-enabled medical devices is crucial, and an ongoing threat vector is insider attacks. In this paper, we focus on the identification of insider attacks in healthcare SDNs. Specifically, we survey stakeholders from 12 healthcare organizations (i.e., two hospitals and two clinics in Hong Kong, two hospitals and two clinics in Singapore, and two hospitals and two clinics in China). Based on the survey findings, we develop a trust-based approach based on Bayesian inference to figure out malicious devices in a healthcare environment. Experimental results in either a simulated and a real-world network environment demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach regarding the detection of malicious healthcare devices, i.e., our approach could decrease the trust values of malicious devices faster than similar approaches.},   keywords={Bayes methods;computer network security;health care;inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;medical information systems;software defined networking;trusted computing;insider attacks;healthcare software-defined networks;medical industry;network control;medical devices;healthcare SDNs;Bayesian inference;malicious devices;healthcare environment;real-world network environment;malicious healthcare devices;Bayesian-based trust management;Internet of Medical Things environment;Medical services;Organizations;Wireless sensor networks;Security;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;software-defined networking;trust computation and management;healthcare network;Bayesian inference},   doi={10.1109/TNSM.2018.2815280},   ISSN={1932-4537},   month={June},}

 title={PESA: Probabilistic Efficient Storage Algorithm for Time-Domain Spectrum Measurements}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Wireless communication is an essential part of daily life for users globally with applications in medical devices, cellular phones, Internet of Things nodes, and others. Accordingly, there is a need to understand the patterns and properties of radio-frequency spectrum use by acquiring accurate spectrum utilization measurements. However, the massive storage volume needed to execute spectrum surveys-especially when a fast sampling rate is used--is an impeding factor in terms of cost and ease-of-access. In this paper, a probabilistic efficient storage algorithm (PESA) is proposed to facilitate high-accuracy, time-domain spectrum surveys conducted at a fast sample acquisition rate to detect sporadic spectrum occupancy patterns that could be in the order of microseconds. PESA divides the dynamic range of monitoring equipment into bins--each represented by one component of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Windows of activity and inactivity in the measurements are established by comparing with a threshold, and then indicators to the GMM component that best describes a window are recorded, hence reducing the required storage volume. Results demonstrate that ≈99% reduction in the storage volume is achievable while maintaining an accurate estimation of channel utilization (CU) and activity/inactivity periods. Furthermore, a LabVIEW implementation of PESA on a hardware platform was executed and used to survey Wi-Fi channel 1 in a healthcare environment for seven consecutive hours. Although more than 25 billion samples were observed, the resulting data only occupied 96.28 MB.},   keywords={Wireless communication;Time-domain analysis;Wireless fidelity;Volume measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Time-frequency analysis;Cognitive radio;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Internet of Things (IoT);spectrum survey;Wi-Fi;wireless coexistence},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2018.2851678},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={},}

Its advances, among other things, enable new opportunities for better health services but, as a side effect, it introduces new threats to privacy. If anywhere, it is in the health care sector that privacy is of utmost importance. Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most "primitive" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning. This latter contribution also paves the way for further development and for applications of pervasive computing in general.},   keywords={biomedical communication;computer network security;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;radiofrequency identification;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks;hard security provisioning;soft security provisioning;computationally weak pervasive computing systems;electronic health;e-health;health care sector;data privacy;Internet of Things technology;primitive member;bare sensors;RFID;wireless medical sensor deployment;body area network deployment;Protocols;Security;Computer security;Logic gates;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;Electronic medical records;Medical services;Pervasive computing},   doi={10.1109/MWC.2013.6590047},   ISSN={1536-1284},   month={August},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={373-378},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as billions of devices and wirelessly connected systems will soon be adopting various IoT technologies and exchanging potentially sensitive information. IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities. Therefore, rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving environment.

Internet of Things (IoT) is the new technology which includes the collection of Sensors, Actuators, processors and other development boards (eg. Raspberry pi, Arduino etc) to collect the data from different sources depending upon domain of application, process the acquired data before sending to distant cloud or mobile application depending upon the requirement[7]. The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe.

 title={Internet of things baseline method to improve health sterilization in hospitals: An approach from electronic instrumentation and processing of steam quality}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Sterilization in hospitals is performed due to the need of attacking and killing bacteria that can be dangerous for patients when intervened with medical instrumentation. In that sense, sterilization autoclaves are used, and controlling both temperature and pressure, bacteria are killed. Nonetheless, in some cases the level of humidity in the internal atmosphere is highly relevant to guarantee the success of the process. This variable is controlled by knowing the steam quality, however, it is not monitored online, but sampling is performed a few times a year, so pertinent adjustments are carried out into the boiler when needed. This periodic maintenance does not guarantee that the process is effective. On the other hand, instruments for monitoring steam quality are expensive, and cannot be afforded by many hospitals. As a result, a cheaper determination of steam quality is carried out by using chemical instruments like test tubes, adding critical errors in the measurements. In this paper a cost-effective measuring and processing method by implementing Internet of Things - IoT-techniques is proposed, based on strangulation calorimeter. All the calculations are performed in a Single Board Computer which is connected to an IoT platform for logging data, supervise in pseudo real time and use statistical tools to inference or predict. As a result, the IoT node can achieve measurement errors up to 0.25% FS, against 5.6% FS of traditional method. Furthermore, the inclusion of pseudo real time monitoring, allows maintenance staff to fix problems even in a predictive way.},   keywords={computerised monitoring;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;measurement errors;microorganisms;steam;sterilisation (microbiological);hospitals;chemical instruments;pseudoreal time monitoring;health sterilization;electronic instrumentation;medical instrumentation;sterilization autoclaves;cost-effective processing method;bacteria;cost-effective measuring method;IoT-techniques;Internet of Things baseline method;steam quality processing;steam quality monitoring;measurement errors;Instruments;Hospitals;Temperature measurement;Liquids;Microorganisms;Internet of Things;Containers;Internet of Things;hospital;instrumentation;sterilization;steam quality},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399370},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

In-home remote patient monitoring applications harnessing technological advancements in the area of Internet of things (IoT), semantic web, data analytics, and cloud computing have emerged as viable alternatives. However, such applications generate large amounts of real-time data in terms of volume, velocity, and variety thus making it a big data problem. Hence, the challenge is how to combine and analyse such data with historical patient data to obtain meaningful diagnoses suggestions within acceptable time frames (considering quality of service (QoS)). Despite the evolution of big data processing technologies (e.g. Hadoop) and scalable infrastructure (e.g. clouds), there remains a significant gap in the areas of heterogeneous data collection, real-time patient monitoring, and automated decision support (semantic reasoning) based on well-defined QoS constraints.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={458-463},   abstract={Typical real-time remote health monitoring architectures consist of wearable medical devices continuously transmitting physiological signals to a nearby gateway which routes the data to an remote internet of things (IoT)-platform. Unfortunately, this model falls-short under the strict requirements of healthcare systems. Wearable medical devices have short battery lifespans, the system reliance on a cloud makes it vulnerable to connectivity and latency issues, and there are privacy concerns related to streaming sensitive medical data to remote servers. The compressive sensing (CS) scheme has been explored in the context of bio-signals to reduce the energy consumption of wearable sensors. However, CS does not address the other limitations caused by the model's reliance on cloud-computing but exacerbates the associated computing latency by requiring a computationally complex reconstruction process. In our remote elderly monitoring system, we attempt to address this weakness by developing a gateway-centric connected health system, where most signal processing and analysis occurs locally on heterogeneous multicore edge-devices. This paper explores the efficacy of real-time reconstruction of ECG signals, compressed under the CS scheme, on an IoT-gateway powered by ARM's big. LITTLE multicore solution at different signal dimension and allocated computational resources. Experimental results show the gateway's capability to reconstruct ECG signals in real-time, even when considering dimensionally large windows and minimum computational resources. Moreover, they demonstrate that utilizing more cores for the reconstruction process has a higher impact on execution time and is more energy efficient than increasing the cores' frequency. The optimal resource allocation for the majority of cases is a single big (A15) core at minimum frequency as it provides extreme fast reconstruction while consuming less or slightly more energy than its LITTLE (A7) counterpart. Heterogeneous multicore devices have the computational capacity and energy efficiency to elevate some of the limitations of a cloud-based remote health monitoring and can help create a more sustainable IoT-based connected health.},   keywords={Multicore processing;Real-time systems;Electrocardiography;Sensors;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Microsoft Windows;Remote health monitoring;connected health;compressive sensing;heterogeneous multicore platforms;edge computing},   doi={10.1109/DSD.2018.00082},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard.},   keywords={cloud computing;critical infrastructures;cyber-physical systems;fault tolerance;industrial control;Internet;Internet of Things;SCADA systems;security of data;wireless sensor networks;cloud-assisted IoT-based SCADA system security;industrial systems;fault tolerance;cyber physical system integration;CPS integration;Internet of Things;cloud computing services;smart industrial systems;industrial CPS;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;critical infrastructure;WebSCADA;industrial SCADA systems;IoT-cloud environment;future Internet;mobile wireless sensor networks;Cloud computing;Security;SCADA systems;Power system stability;Fault tolerant systems;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of things;Stability analysis;APT;Industrial Control System;Internet of Things (IoT);NIST;PRECYSE;Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition;SOA;APT;industrial control system;Internet of Things (IoT);NIST;PRECYSE;supervisory control and data acquisition system;SOA},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2549047},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP.

In recent years, any smart device can be used as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things for information interaction. It will be the new research aspect for Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) to regard the human brain (the most intelligent “device”) as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things and to construct the network based on the human brains (we name it as Internet of Brains). In this paper, a model of wearable affective computing was proposed for discriminating different emotional states and constructing the Internet of Brains, by means of effective connectivity of EEG-based brain network. Firstly, we proposed a rational emotion-induced psychological experiment to collect the EEG data under different emotional states. Then, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to decompose different independent components based on different emotional states; Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was utilized to detect the interactive dependencies between each independent component in order to construct the causal connectivity brain network (CCBN); Dynamic characteristics, including causal density and causal flow of the CCBN, were extracted based on Graph Theory. Finally, the corresponding law between characteristics of EEG pattern and “inner” emotional state was discovered to establish affective computing model. Furthermore, the model of wearable affective computing was constructed based on above law with the portable EEG acquisition device, and prototype system of wearable affective computing based on Internet of Brains was achieved for BCI.},   keywords={brain;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;graph theory;independent component analysis;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;EEG-based emotion recognition;electroencephalography;brain network;independent component analysis;Granger causality;brain imaging technology;neuroscience;information technology;human emotion change;cognitive status;psychiatric disorder;Internet of Things;brain-computer interface;Internet-of-brains;rational emotion-induced psychological experiment;ICA;causal connectivity brain network;CCBN;causal density characteristics;causal flow characteristics;graph theory;EEG acquisition device;wearable affective computing;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Internet;Computational modeling;Affective computing;Educational institutions;Analytical models;Independent Component Analysis;Granger Causality;Causal Connectivity Brain Network;Wearable Affective Computing;Internet of Brains},   doi={10.1109/ICCMA.2013.6506157},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

 title={Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={99-104},   abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},   keywords={application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;open systems;real-time systems;secure health care services;OAuth 2.0;JSON Web token;IoT cloud scenario;authorization framework;real time clinical care;automatic monthly payments;bank account;phishing attack;interoperable API;Medical services;Authorization;Servers;Authentication;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;OAuth 2.0;Json Web Token;IOT;Authorization},   doi={10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, the proliferation of wireless devices in industrial applications makes the spectrum sharing in limited industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band a challenging problem. In this paper, it is concerned with the intrinsic impact of the evenness of spectrum usage on the spectrum sharing performance in terms of channel accessing probability, spectrum utilization, and fairness of spectrum usage. In order to explore the explicit relationship between the evenness and spectrum sharing performance, a new concept of equilibrium is first defined to represent the achievable best evenness of spectrum usage. Then, a set of rules called local equilibrium-guided autonomous channel switching (LEQ-AutoCS) is devised, with which each accessed sensor autonomously equalizes the local channel occupations within its range of spectrum sensing without overhead on exchanging the sensors' spectrum sensing reports. It is further proved that the equilibrium can be achieved by this concessive manner. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LEQ-AutoCS rules provide higher utilization and fairness of spectrum usage comparing to the existing spectrum access approaches. Moreover, it is shown that LEQ-AutoCS rules assist the system to reduce the spectrum access delay to 1/2 of CSMA-based systems and 1/50 of TDMA-based systems, respectively.},   keywords={carrier sense multiple access;probability;radio spectrum management;signal detection;time division multiple access;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks;spectrum sharing efficiency;industrial wireless sensor network;IWSN;industry automation;production efficiency improvement;wireless device proliferation;industrial scientific and medical band;ISM band;channel accessing probability;spectrum utilization;spectrum usage fairness;spectrum usage evenness;local equilibrium-guided autonomous channel switching;LEQ-AutoCS;spectrum sensing;TDMA-based system;CSMA-based system;spectrum access delay reduction;Switches;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Industries;Delays;Internet of things;Wireless communication;Industrial wireless sensor networks;spectrum sharing;autonomous channel switching;equilibrium;;Autonomous channel switching;equilibrium;industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs);spectrum sharing},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2490544},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1-10},   abstract={Surface electromyography signal plays an important role in hand function recovery training. In this paper, an IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation system was introduced which was based on a smart wearable armband (SWA), machine learning (ML) algorithms, and a 3-D printed dexterous robot hand. User comfort is one of the key issues which should be addressed for wearable devices. The SWA was developed by integrating a low-power and tiny-sized IoT sensing device with textile electrodes, which can measure, pre-process, and wirelessly transmit bio-potential signals. By evenly distributing surface electrodes over user's forearm, drawbacks of classification accuracy poor performance can be mitigated. A new method was put forward to find the optimal feature set. ML algorithms were leveraged to analyze and discriminate features of different hand movements, and their performances were appraised by classification complexity estimating algorithms and principal components analysis. According to the verification results, all nine gestures can be successfully identified with an average accuracy up to 96.20%. In addition, a 3-D printed five-finger robot hand was implemented for hand rehabilitation training purpose. Correspondingly, user's hand movement intentions were extracted and converted into a series of commands which were used to drive motors assembled inside the dexterous robot hand. As a result, the dexterous robot hand can mimic the user's gesture in a real-time manner, which shows the proposed system can be used as a training tool to facilitate rehabilitation process for the patients after stroke.},   keywords={biomechanics;dexterous manipulators;electromyography;feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;principal component analysis;wearable computers;IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation system;smart wearable armband;machine learning;surface electromyography signal;hand function recovery training;SWA;user comfort;wearable devices;IoT sensing device;textile electrodes;bio-potential signals;surface electrodes;classification accuracy poor performance;optimal feature set;ML algorithms;different hand movements;five-finger robot hand;hand rehabilitation training purpose;rehabilitation process;3D printed dexterous robot hand;user hand movement intentions;Robots;Training;Electrodes;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Three-dimensional displays;sEMG control;stroke rehabilitation;IoT-enabled wearable device;machine learning},   doi={10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2822681},   ISSN={2168-2372},   month={},}

 title={Towards a Heterogeneous Mist, Fog, and Cloud based Framework for the Internet of Healthcare Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Rapid developments in the fields of information and communication technology and microelectronics allowed seamless interconnection among various devices letting them to communicate with each other. This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS) -in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics -has always been the main challenge in designing such systems. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a five-layered heterogeneous mist, fog, and cloud based IoHT framework capable of efficiently handling and routing (near-)real-time as well as offline/batch mode data. Also, by employing software defined networking and link adaptation based load balancing, the framework ensures optimal resource allocation and efficient resource utilization. The results, obtained by simulating the framework, indicate that the designed network via its various components can achieve high QoS, with reduced end-to-end latency and packet drop rate, which is essential for developing next generation e-healthcare systems.},   keywords={Medical services;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Quality of service;Monitoring;Healthcare big data;healthcare application;data fusion;real-time computing;resource allocation;quality of service;load balancing.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876088},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Most countries are trying to introduce and disseminate telemedicine service (TMS) to decrease the necessary budget for health services. However, many doctors are concerned about the security of telemedicine services. Security of medical information should be reinforced for widespread use of telemedicine. This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats. This paper considers the security aspects of telemedicine and the Internet of things (IoT) together, because, after all, healthcare-devices perform a function of telecommunication.

Due to the characteristics of IoT devices (i.e., low power and low battery), usage of these devices in critical applications requires sophisticated security measures. Researchers from academia and industry now increasingly exploit the concept of blockchains to achieve security in IoT applications. The basic idea of the blockchain is that the data generated by users or devices in the past are verified for correctness and cannot be tampered once it is updated on the blockchain. Even though the blockchain supports integrity and non-repudiation to some extent, confidentiality and privacy of the data or the devices are not preserved. The content of the data can be seen by anyone in the network for verification and mining purposes.

Due to time constraint, people are not visiting hospitals, which might and possibly lead to a lot of health issues in one instant of time. Predominantly most of the healthcare systems have been developed to predict and diagnose the health of the patients by which people who are busy in their schedule can also monitor their health at regular intervals. Many studies show that early prediction is the best way to cure health because early diagnosis will help and alert the patients to know the health status. Healthcare being a global issue more particularly India being a most populated nation where majority of which live in villages deprived of healthcare facilities on real time basis continuously and regularly. With the increasing use of technology, there is an urgent need to have such a smart health monitoring system that can communicate between network devices and application which will help the patients and doctors to monitor, track and record the patient's sensitive data containing medical information. This paper depicts the idea of solving health issues using the latest technology, Internet of Things (IoT). It presents the architectural review of smart healthcare system using Internet of Things(IoT) which is aimed to provide a Better HealthCare to everyone.

EEG-based classification is crucial for a wide-range of applications to analyze real-time vital signs using features concerning predefined set of data classes. The aim of this paper is to conduct a comparative study for several classification techniques and demonstrate the effect of uncertainty in the EEG data on the classification accuracy. We define a model for decomposing the EEG using various transformation such as discrete cosine transform, discrete wavelet transform into several sub-bands. After feature extraction, a comparative study to assess the classification algorithms' performance is conducted. In addition, we evaluate their overall accuracy and complexity as performance measures. For this purpose, we use the support vector machine (SVM) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These are chosen as classifier models to study the performance of the obtained features. The discussion will include the evaluation of the classifiers' performance using the EEG-based epileptic seizure data in two categories, noiseless and noisy.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={880-887},   abstract={With the need for increased care and welfare of the rapidly aging population, mobile telemedicine is becoming popular for providing remote health care to increase the quality of life. Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the “edge”, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920×1080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3×3 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.},   keywords={cellular neural nets;edge detection;floating point arithmetic;health care;image segmentation;Internet of Things;medical image processing;mobile computing;telemedicine;rapidly aging population;mobile telemedicine;remote health care;image analysis;medical diagnosis;image processing;high-resolution images;real-time constraints;segmentation results;cellular neural network;real-time medical image segmentation;low power mobile computing platforms;compressed CeNN framework;edge segmentation;compressed cellular neural networks;4-8 Giga floating point multiplications},   doi={10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203873},   ISSN={1558-2434},   month={Nov},}

Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},   keywords={Big Data;cognitive systems;fault tolerant computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;model-driven methodology;autonomic cognitive IoT-based systems;health care;Internet of Things;autonomic cognitive design patterns;smart IoT-based systems;Big Data;scalability management;system functional requirements;system nonfunctional requirements;cognitive monitoring system;patient health management;heterogeneous wearable devices;heterogeneous large-scale data stream integration;heterogeneous large-scale data stream processing;system performance evaluation;response time;Scalability;Monitoring;Big Data;Complexity theory;Complex systems;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Autonomic computing;big data;cognitive computing;design patterns;IoT-based system},   doi={10.1109/TETCI.2017.2699218},   ISSN={2471-285X},   month={June},}

 title={A Novel Grading Biomarker for the Prediction of Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease}, 
  year={2017},   volume={64},   number={1},   pages={155-165},   abstract={Objective: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not only crucial in clinical practice, but also has a significant potential to enrich clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;diseases;feature selection;image registration;medical image processing;ADNI dataset;Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative;sparse representation technique;feature selection;age correction;image registration accuracy;magnetic resonance images;mild cognitive impairment;grading biomarker;Aging;Pathology;Biomedical imaging;Alzheimer's disease;Biomedical measurement;Magnetic resonance imaging;Alzheimer's disease (AD);biomarker;machine learning;prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion;structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging;Aged;Aging;Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Biomarkers;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Disease Progression;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique},   doi={10.1109/TBME.2016.2549363},   ISSN={0018-9294},   month={Jan},}

Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

For such applications an accuracy within a few meters is desired. Available radio based systems within that accuracy are neither cost effective nor easy to deploy. In this work, we suggest an approach called bi-phase measurement based on phase measurements with two frequencies to determine the location of a tag. We design and build a complete indoor positioning system based on bi-phase measurements with easy to deploy and mobile wireless sensor nodes. The wireless sensor nodes form anchors and tags and communicate results to a location engine of the indoor positioning system. Our implementation comprises low-cost IEEE802.15.4 radio chips with built-in support for phase measurements unit for both, anchor and tags. We compute the position of the tag based on distance estimation retrieved with biphase measurements.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={871-876},   abstract={Lifelogging physical activity (PA) assessment is crucial to healthcare technologies and studies for the purpose of treatments and interventions of chronic diseases. Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies. Whilst PA activity monitoring by mobile phone is still a challenging issue by far due to much more uncertainties than wearable devices.},   keywords={biomechanics;diseases;health care;mobile handsets;patient monitoring;telemedicine;Google Fit app;metabolic equivalents;ellipse fitting model;chronic diseases;healthcare technologies;PA activity monitoring;mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA;wearable device Samsung;mobile app tracker Moves;regular uncertainties;irregular uncertainties;wellbeing monitoring;PA pattern detection;PA measurement;PA recognition techniques;diverse physical characteristics;mobile phone;traditional lifelogging PA monitoring;physical activity assessment;mobile devices;personalised lifelogging physical activity intensity pattern assessment;uncertainty investigation;Uncertainty;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Legged locomotion;Monitoring;physical activity;intensity pattern;ellipse fitting model;density map;mobile device},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.134},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the collection of connected smart devices\objects through internet network. The rapid development of IoT and vast expansion of wireless technologies unfold the new chances of growth in several domains such as, Education, Transportation, Agriculture, and especially in the Healthcare sector. Introducing the IoT through healthcare applications fetch several benefits, including cost savings through lowered hospital visiting costs, health care provider costs, transportation costs, human resource costs and the insurance costs. It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT. There is a great need to design and develop a lightweight secure authentication model, which offers significant security level against multiple attacks such as mainly: Impersonation attacks, man in the middle attack and unknown key sharing attacks for IoT base E-health domain. This research proposed a secure group-based lightweight authentication scheme for IoT based E-health applications, the proposed model will provide mutual authentication and energy efficient, and computation for healthcare IoT based applications.

 title={PhD Forum: Multimodal IoT and EMR Based Smart Health Application for Asthma Management in Children}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-2},   abstract={According to a study done in 2014 by National Health Interview Survey around 6.3 million children in United States suffer from asthma [1]. Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using an inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.},   keywords={diseases;electronic health records;Internet of Things;mobile computing;paediatrics;patient monitoring;electronic medical records;vulnerability score;asthma control level;multimodal data processing;kHealth framework;continuous patient monitoring;children;asthma management;smart health application;EMR;multimodal IoT;Pediatrics;Air quality;Temperature measurement;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Humidity},   doi={10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947025},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Such performance can be obtained with time-based digital pixel sensors (DPS) working at ultra-low voltage (ULV), at the expense of lower dynamic range, higher fixed-pattern noise (FPN) and thus poorer image quality. To address this problem, three key techniques were developed in this work for DPS pixels: wide-range adaptive body biasing, low-gating of the 2-transistor in-pixel comparator and digital readout performing delta-reset sampling with low switching activity and robust timing closure. These concepts were demonstrated by designing and fabricating a 128 × 128 CMOS image sensor array in a 65 nm low-power CMOS logic process. Operating at 0.5 V, it features an FPN of 0.66%, a dynamic range of 42 dB and a fill factor of 57% with a 4 μm pixel pitch, while consuming only 17 pJ/(frame.pixel) and 8.8 μW at 32 fps. These performances combined with the small silicon area of 0.69 mm<sup>2</sup>makes the imager perfectly suitable for integration in ULP SoCs, targeting WSN applications.},   keywords={CMOS image sensors;comparators (circuits);digital readout;image sampling;Internet of Things;low-power electronics;nanoelectronics;nanosensors;sensor arrays;system-on-chip;wireless sensor networks;DPS CMOS image sensor array;ultra low power SoC;wireless sensors node;Internet of Things;nanometer CMOS systems-on-chip;time-based digital pixel sensor;ultra low voltage;fixed pattern noise;wide range adaptive body biasing;2-transistor in-pixel comparator;digital readout;delta reset sampling;WSN;ULP SoC;digital pixel sensor;size 65 nm;voltage 0.5 V;energy 17 pJ;power 8.8 muW;System-on-chip;CMOS integrated circuits;Switches;Leakage currents;Wireless sensor networks;MOS devices;Logic gates;CMOS image sensor;ultra-low power;ultra-low voltage;system-on-chip},   doi={10.1109/JSSC.2015.2457897},   ISSN={0018-9200},   month={Oct},}

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile computing;social networking (online);social sciences computing;social persuasion;online network;physical network;interpersonal trust;data-driven analysis;Internet of Things;big data;smartphone;cyber world;Market research;Social network services;Media;Context modeling;Internet;Global Positioning System;Public policy;Design methodology;Algorithm design and analysis;Internet of things;Complex networks;Medical services;Social factors;Behavioral science;Cyber–physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion;Cyber–physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion},   doi={10.1109/JPROC.2014.2363986},   ISSN={0018-9219},   month={Dec},}

One of the feasible ways to offer healthcare services based on IoT is to monitor human's health in real-time using ubiquitous health monitoring systems which have the ability to acquire bio-signals from sensor nodes and send the data to the gateway via a particular wireless communication protocol. The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases.

In the healthcare environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to physicians and patients as they can be applied to various medical areas (such as constant real-time monitoring, patient information management, medical emergency management, blood information management, and health management). The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment. In this paper, we discuss the security requirements of RFID authentication schemes, and in particular, we present a review of ECC-based RFID authentication schemes in terms of performance and security. Although most of them cannot satisfy all security requirements and have satisfactory performance, we found that there are three recently proposed ECC-based authentication schemes suitable for the healthcare environment in terms of their performance and security.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;radiofrequency identification;Internet of Things;healthcare environment;elliptic curve cryptography;IoT technologies;radio-frequency identification technology;security requirements;ECC-based RFID authentication schemes;Radiofrequency identification;Authentication;Medical devices;Medical services;Internet of Things;Biomedical monitoring;Intelligent ;Elliptic curve cryptography;Cryptography;Radiofrequency identification;Computer security;Authentication;Elliptic curve cryptography;Internet of Things;Performance;Radio Frequency indentification;Security;Authentication;elliptic curve cryptography (ECC);Internet of Things (IoT);performance;radio-frequency identification (RFID);security},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2360121},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Recently, an accelerating number of studies are dedicated to deploying various IoT applications in the information centric network paradigm which has lower system complexity than traditional network architectures. However, such a paradigm poses a number of security challenges especially when it is applied in real-time e-health applications. Firstly, it is difficult to ensure security of sensitive data in such a distributed data caching environment because after the data is published in the form of a packet to the information centric network (ICN), it is no longer controlled by the data publisher. Secondly, in some real-time e-health applications, terminal medical sensors are usually resource-constrained, limiting the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. In order to address these challenges, a resource-efficient secure data sharing scheme in information centric e-health system is proposed, one that utilizes ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and adapts it to the above-mentioned system with respect to necessary security requirements. It also exploits computation resources of fog nodes and employs outsourcing cryptography to improve system efficiency.The evaluation demonstrates that the scheme can significantly reduce the computation overheads of the resource-constrained terminal medical devices, and can better support the real-time e-health applications.},   keywords={cache storage;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;outsourcing;resource-efficient secure data;information centric e-health system;fog computing;accelerating number;IoT applications;information centric network paradigm;lower system complexity;security challenges;real-time e-health applications;sensitive data;distributed data caching environment;data publisher;above-mentioned system;computation resources;system efficiency;resource-constrained terminal medical devices;network architectures;security requirements;Encryption;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Edge computing;Publish-subscribe},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422844},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The assessment value of host security is finally obtained by knowledge repository update and dynamic machine learning, helping users to detect the behavior pattern and reinforce the host security.

The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters. Through dissemination of the concept at this early phase of development in establishing the resource, an open invitation for peers and related interested parties to critique, advise, and otherwise contribute toward optimal development and wide impact is offered.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;Internet of Things resource;SoundScapes;health care intervention;health care communication;ICT use;information and communication technology;treatment outcomes;patient rehabilitation;evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource;feed-in feed-out entity;in-action model;on-action model;Games;Medical services;Cloud computing;Context;Technological innovation;Training;cloud-based collaboration resource;communication;Internet of Things;therapy;rehabilitation;healthcare},   doi={10.1109/CTS.2014.6867605},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

To exploit this opportunity, an ecosystem should be established first. Technical solutions should aim for a cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={The last decade has witnessed tremendous efforts to shape the internet of thing (IoT) platforms to be well suited for healthcare applications. These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multi-channel EEG signals as well as a designed sparsifying basis to increase the sparsity of the EEG signal to improve the reconstruction quality, hence, increase the efficiency of the system.},   keywords={compressed sensing;data acquisition;electroencephalography;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;joint sparsity recovery;compressive sensing;healthcare applications;remote monitoring platforms;system complexity;continuous wireless data transmission;CS;emerging theory;compressed acquisition;hardware friendly structured sensing matrices;vital sign acquisition;connected health application;IoT platform;multichannel EEG signals;power consumption;sensing matrices;subNyquist sampling rates;electroencephalogram;energy consumption;reconstruction quality improvement;Electroencephalography;Sensors;Matching pursuit algorithms;Image coding;Compressed sensing;Wireless communication;Brain modeling;Internet of things (IoT);EEG;compressive sensing (CS);joint sparsity},   doi={10.1109/ICUWB.2017.8251001},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results.

These are biggest service industries that affect whole world population and give jobs to millions of people. Recently we witness major changes in both industries, as more services are transferred to small providers, including individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people.

As connected IoT devices have enhanced smart home, connected smart homes are expected to grow into smart community. However, several previous studies about smart community require a remote central server and do not consider local collaboration based on local direct communication networks. This paper proposes home-to-home (H2H) communication based on wireless communication between homes in a local community. Several types of local collaborations are described. Two plausible H2H communication architectures are presented such as centralized and distributed. Two architectures are evaluated using two metrics: traffic volume and communication reliability. Clustering is also adopted to reduce traffic volume. The evaluation results show that the centralized architecture is superior in traffic volume and it is more adequate for all-to-all type of local collaboration such as information sharing; that the distributed architecture is superior in communication reliability and it is more adequate for one-to-all type of local collaboration such as safety and security. Clustering greatly reduces traffic volumes. Therefore, the proposed H2H communications will provide more efficient communication and more reliable services under the circumstances of IoT-enabled smart homes.},   keywords={home computing;Internet of Things;telecommunication traffic;home-to-home communications;smart community;Internet of Things;connected IoT devices;connected smart homes;remote central server;local direct communication networks;wireless communication;plausible H2H communication architectures;traffic volume;communication reliability;distributed architecture;Collaboration;Base stations;Mercury (metals);Smart homes;Monitoring;Medical services;Safety;Internet of Things;Wireless Sensor Network;Smart Community;Smart Home;Local Collaboration},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983222},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={132-137},   abstract={The rapid advances in modern wireless technology opens the door for new applications using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In the medical field, staff members of a certain hospital are in need for a system that tracks where patients/medical staff/devices are at any given time. LoCATE, which is Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment, provides a near-real time tracking tool for medical systems using the existing 802.11 WiFi infrastructure. The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara<sup>®</sup>RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions. While implications for an IoT system such as LoCATE are wide-ranging; its primary objective is to provide an easy to use, low-cost solution to track the location of medical assets in real-time.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;radiofrequency identification;Web services;wireless LAN;Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment;wireless technology;Internet of Things;IoT technology;near-real time tracking tool;medical system;WiFi infrastructure;Sentara RMH hospital;real-time location data;cloud computing platform;Amazon Web Services;mobile app;cloud storage platform;health care system;LoCATE system;radiofrequency identification;RFID technology;patient health data;disease;medical asset location;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Wireless fidelity;Transmitters;Hospitals;Cloud Computing;E-Health Care;Internet of Things (IoT);Localization},   doi={10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937703},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

A specific health care application is to ascertain patients' activity of daily living while at home using accelerometer data from non-invasive wearables. It is often necessary to store this data on the device to be retrieved later for analysis. However, the devices typically store far more data than can be transmitted with commonly used low power radios. To mitigate the problem, this paper proposes an energy efficient, lossless compression algorithm that uses an offline frequency distribution to create a symbol-code lookup table. Using an extensive set of data from a previous study, an analysis of the entropy of activities of daily living accelerometer data is presented. The compression algorithm is compared against this estimated entropy. Energy being critical for IoT devices, the trade-off between energy cost for compression versus energy saved during transmission is also analysed.},   keywords={accelerometers;data compression;entropy;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;table lookup;noninvasive wearables;symbol-code lookup table;IoT devices;energy analysis;Internet of Things;numerous future applications;frequency distribution;health care application;computational resourses;patients activity;power radios;energy efficiency;entropy analysis;energy transmission;accelerometer lossless compression algorithm;Entropy;Accelerometers;Conferences;Medical services;Compression algorithms;Biomedical monitoring;Dictionaries},   doi={10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8368985},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={97-104},   abstract={Wearables are the next big development in the mobile internet of things. Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide hap tic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.},   keywords={Bluetooth;body area networks;Internet of Things;mobile computing;security of data;open source multicomponent hardware-software platform;wearable security;mobile Internet of Things;body area network;smartphone user;Bluetooth LE;online Web servers;security vulnerability test cases;SecuWear platform;Mobile communication;Security;Bluetooth;Biomedical monitoring;Hardware;Sensors;Trade agreements;wearables;security;vulnerability discovery;internet of things;Bluetooth low energy;man-in-the-middle},   doi={10.1109/MobServ.2015.23},   ISSN={2329-6429},   month={June},}

State-of-the-art algorithms suffer from two issues: computation intensive features and large internal memory requirement, which make them inapplicable for constrained devices. We reduce the memory requirement of our algorithm by reducing the size of data segments (i.e. the window of input stream data on which the processing is performed), and the number of required EEG channels. To respect the limitations of the processing capability, we reduce the complexity of our exploited features by only considering the simple features, which also contributes to reducing the memory requirements. Then, we provide new relevant features to compensate the information loss due to the simplifications (i.e. less number of channels, simpler features, shorter segment, etc.). We measured the energy consumption (12.41 mJ) and execution time (565 ms) for processing each segment (i.e. 5.12 seconds of EEG data) on a low-power MSP432 device.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Recently, development of wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enables the real-time and continuous individual electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. In this study, we develop a novel IoT-based wearable 12-lead ECG SmartVest system for early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which consists of four typical IoT components: 1) sensing layer using textile dry ECG electrode; 2) network layer utilizing Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.; 3) cloud saving and calculation platform and server; and 4) application layer for signal analysis and decision making. We focus on addressing the challenge of real-time signal quality assessment (SQA) and lightweight QRS detection for wearable ECG application. First, a combination method of multiple signal quality indices and machine learning is proposed for classifying 10-s single-channel ECG segments as acceptable and unacceptable. Then a lightweight QRS detector is developed for accurate location of QRS complexes. The results show that the proposed SQA method can efficiently deal with trade-off between accepting good (97.9%) and rejecting poor (96.4%) quality ECGs, ensuring that only a low percentage of recorded ECGs are discarded. The proposed lightweight QRS detector achieves a F1 score higher than 99.5% for processing clean ECGs. Meanwhile, it reports significantly higher F1 scores than two existing QRS detectors for processing noisy ECGs. In addition, it also has a fine computation efficiency. This work demonstrates that the developed IoT-driven ECG SmartVest system can be applied for widely monitoring the population during daily life and has a promising application future.},   keywords={Electrocardiogram (ECG);eHealth and mHealth;signal quality assessment (SQA);ECG QRS detection;Internet of Things (IoT);wearable ECG device;cardiovascular disease monitoring.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2844090},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

 title={Lightweight Break-Glass Access Control System for Healthcare Internet-of-Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={14},   number={8},   pages={3610-3617},   abstract={Healthcare Internet-of-things (IoT) has been proposed as a promising means to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and accessed by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while preventing unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system that supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data.

Robotic assisted fracture surgery (RAFS) can facilitate the minimally invasive surgery which reduces scarring, infection risk and long hospital stays. One important step in RAFS is to establish the coordinate system link between patient joint (rigidly connected with the robotic system) and an external tracking system. As X-ray fluoroscopic images are routinely used during the procedure, an automatic method is proposed to detect and localize landmarks on the tracking tool using live X-ray image. The proposed method uses combination of block detection, geometric model matching and principle component analysis.

 title={Perspectives on Energy Storage for Flexible Electronic Systems}, 
  year={2015},   volume={103},   number={4},   pages={535-553},   abstract={If truly thin embedded and human worn flexible electronics are to become a commercial reality for wearable electronics, medical devices, and internet of things tags, effective energy storage technologies that safely and robustly match the mechanical flexibility of the overall system form factor are required. At the same time, the energy and transient power needs of functions such as wireless connectivity, information display, and high sample rate sensing must be supported. These capabilities have time-dependent power and current requirements often not captured in simple energy and capacity metrics. In this paper, a progression of energy storage approaches, challenges and learning experiences will be presented from the perspective of an energy storage technology developer. The essential requirements for energy storage for feature-driven applications in flexible electronics are addressed with the goal of finding the most compelling fit between products needs, consumer safety and the technology capabilities of different energy storage approaches. Micropower modules from supercapacitors to microbatteries and their limitations for flexible electronics will be discussed in terms of capacity, power and charge retention as the starting point. Following this discussion, limitations of lithium technologies in this flexible and thin (&amp;lt;; 1 mm) application space are also outlined. This paper then presents a review of key requirements for energy storage for high functionality flexible electronics prototype systems and some approaches that have been explored to meet those needs. This leads to the conclusion that safe, low cost, flexible electronics energy storage requirements may be most appropriately met using intrinsically stable battery chemistry. Furthermore, such a materials approach allows for simpler lower cost processing and packaging, such as additive printing and roll to roll processing of thin and therefore more mechanically flexible cells. Examples and performance data from such a zinc polymer battery technology are given and compared to other thin and flexible battery approaches.},   keywords={energy storage;flexible electronics;secondary cells;energy storage;flexible electronic systems;battery chemistry;additive printing;roll to roll processing;mechanically flexible cells;zinc polymer battery technology;flexible battery;Batteries;Flexible electronics;Energy storage;Wearable computing;Capacitors;Packaging;Batteries;body sensor networks;internet of things;printed circuits;wearable sensors;Batteries;body sensor networks;internet of things;printed circuits;wearable sensors},   doi={10.1109/JPROC.2015.2406340},   ISSN={0018-9219},   month={April},}

  year={2012},   volume={},   number={},   pages={745-750},   abstract={Embedded intelligence entails a vision of the Internet of Things oriented to "Ambient Intelligence", which can be defined as the capacity to collect and analyze the digital traces left by people when they interact with the environment and with such "intelligent things". In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},   keywords={data structures;ecology;embedded systems;emergency services;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;health hazards anticipation;ontology-based IoT domotic environment;embedded intelligence;Internet of Things;ambient intelligence;digital traces;intelligent things;human behavior;everyday life;automated home;Internet-capable things;semantic knowledge representation;semantic Web;distributed environmental context information;natural abstraction;interoperability;technology-independent manner;domestic environment;computational significance;intelligent ecosystem;machine learning;artificial intelligence techniques;occupants behaviors;e-health system;emergency situations;Ontologies;Semantics;Ambient intelligence;Context;Senior citizens;Monitoring;Ambient Intelligent;domotics;home automation;DomoNet;SOA;XML;Ontology;Machine Learning;E-Health},   doi={10.1109/IMIS.2012.109},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={20021-20030},   abstract={This paper proposes a new deep learning method, the greedy deep weighted dictionary learning for mobile multimedia for medical diseases analysis. Based on the traditional dictionary learning methods, which neglects the relationship between the sample and the dictionary atom, we propose the weighted mechanism to connect the sample with the dictionary atom in this paper. Meanwhile, the traditional dictionary learning method is prone to cause over-fitting for patient classification of the limited training data set. Therefore, this paper adopts l<sub>2</sub>-norm regularization constraint, which realizes the limitation of the model space, and enhances the generalization ability of the model and avoids over-fitting to some extent. Compared with the previous shallow dictionary learning, this paper proposed the greedy deep dictionary learning. We adopt the thinking of layer by layer training to increase the hidden layer, so that the local information between the layer and the layer can be trained to maintain their own characteristics, reduce the risk of overfitting and make sure that each layer of the network is convergent, which improves the accuracy of training and learning. With the development of Internet of Things and the soundness of healthcare monitoring system, the method proposed have better reliability in the field of mobile multimedia for healthcare. The results show that the learning method has a good effect on the classification of mobile multimedia for medical diseases, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classification have good performance, which may provide guidance for the diagnosis of disease in wisdom medical.},   keywords={diseases;greedy algorithms;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;mobile computing;multimedia systems;pattern classification;greedy deep learning method;medical disease analysis;greedy deep weighted dictionary;mobile multimedia;medical diseases analysis;traditional dictionary learning method;dictionary atom;greedy deep dictionary learning;shallow dictionary learning;patient classification;l2-norm regularization constraint;Internet of Things;healthcare;disease diagnosis;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Big Data;Medical services;Dictionaries;Training;Medical big data;machine learning;mobile multimedia;deep learning;dictionary learning;patient classification},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823979},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

They promise to offer information about sleep quality of the user by recording a limited number of vital signals, mainly heart rate and body movement. Typically, fitness trackers, smart watches, smart shirts, smartphone applications or patches do not provide access to the raw sensor data. Moreover, the sleep classification algorithm and the agreement ratio with the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG) are not disclosed. Some commercial systems record and store the data on the wearable device, but the user needs to transfer and import it into specialised software applications or return it to the doctor, for clinical evaluation of the data set. Thus an immediate feedback mechanism or the possibility of remote control and supervision are lacking. Furthermore, many such systems only distinguish between sleep and wake states, or between wake, light sleep and deep sleep. It is not always clear how these stages are mapped to the four known sleep stages: REM, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3-4. [1] The goal of this research is to find a reduced complexity method to process a minimum number of bio vital signals, while providing accurate sleep classification results.

 title={Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers}, 
  year={2017},   volume={60},   number={1},   pages={4-23},   abstract={Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},   keywords={health care;home computing;Internet of Things;patient care;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;patients adoption;WSN-based smart home healthcare system;patient-centered care;smart telecommunication technology;Internet of Things;wireless sensor network;generic technology adoption model;WSN-SHHS research;WSN-SHHS application;technology adoption theory;pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model;home healthcare agency;home healthcare patient;Kvale approach;human detachment;life-quality expectancy;predictive power accounting;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Context modeling;Predictive models;Smart homes;Collaboration;Technological innovation;Internet of things;smart home healthcare systems;usability;wireless-sensor network},   doi={10.1109/TPC.2016.2632822},   ISSN={0361-1434},   month={March},}

With smart sensing and remote monitoring, peoples' health conditions can be assessed more effectively but to provide IoT services such as depressive disorder assistance still, there are many challenges to overcome. A huge number of connected heterogeneous devices and enormous amounts of data generated by these devices are not only difficult to manage but providing services with them in a dynamic IoT environment, count for significant efforts. There is a requirement for mechanisms that not only cater the heterogeneity of IoT devices but also provide dynamic services efficiently based on user requirements. Web of Objects (WoO) platform enables IoT services by virtualizing real world objects using semantic ontology. It provides a base for the development of interoperable microservices which support dynamic features by utilizing streams of sensory data.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is becoming a commonly used terminology due to the idea of Internet of Things (IoT). M2M communication has many areas of application, such as in; medical, transport, environmental monitoring, smart grids among others. As the field of its application expands, the number of M2M devices is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years. Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been identified as one of the suitable wireless communication technologies for M2M communication. Incorporating M2M communication on top of regular Human-to-Human (H2H) communication in LTE is a challenging task due to the expected increase in the number of M2M devices coupled with the unique characteristics of M2M traffic. Therefore, the current scheduling and resource allocation techniques among others being used in LTE need to be refined to efficiently accommodate M2M communication. A scheduling scheme called fixed Access Grant Time Interval (AGTI) time-controlled scheduling scheme was proposed for scheduling M2M traffic in LTE. Resource sharing and utilization under this scheme is inefficient due to fixed AGTI assignment which results into fixed nature of resource allocation. In this work, we propose a scheduling scheme called Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme in which the AGTI is dynamically assigned basing on M2M and H2H traffic intensities. We model the proposed scheme using M/G/m/m queuing technique focusing on resource utilization and Quality of Service (QoS) of both M2M and H2H traffic. The analytical results show that, the Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme achieves; better percentage resource utilization as compared to Fixed AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme while providing optimal blocking probability for both M2M and H2H traffic. However, the monitoring of resource usage and reassignments of AGTI in Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme increases scheduler complexity.},   keywords={Long Term Evolution;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;synchronisation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;resource sharing;machine-to-machine communication;M2M communication;M2M traffic;human-to-human communication;H2H communication;H2H traffic;Long Term Evolution;LTE networks;M2M devices;wireless communication technologies;resource allocation techniques;access grant time interval;dynamic AGTI ime-controlled scheduling scheme;M-G-m-m queuing technique;resource utilization;quality of service;QoS;fixed AGTI time-controlled scheduling scheme;optimal blocking probability;resource usage;scheduler complexity;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Delays;Quality of service;Long Term Evolution;Equations;LTE;Machine-to-Machine Communication;Human-to-Human communication;Fixed AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme and Dynamic AGTI Time-controlled Scheduling Scheme},   doi={10.1109/TSSA.2014.7065909},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Compared to actual nurse calling systems, the proposed transmitter neither needs batteries nor long wires to provide energy. Therefore, it is maintenance-free and can be easily installed. The key feature of the proposed system is that it will harvest its energy from motion. When a patient presses the push button to call a nurse, the mechanical energy converter will convert this small movement into electrical power, and then a radio signal is sent to the receiver module. This activates an alarm at the nurse station's display. Also, this alarm is forwarded to other platforms such as nurse's smart phone and smart watch. The goal of this work is to develop a smart, green, and wireless system unlike most of current nurse calling systems in which are not necessarily the case.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Over 125,000 Americans die annually from not taking medication properly. Problems range from taking the wrong medicine or wrong dosage to forgetting to take the medication entirely. This can cause a wide array of medical complications, depending on the nature of medications the patient takes. This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.},   keywords={Android (operating system);biomedical electronics;Bluetooth;computerised instrumentation;consumer electronics;drugs;microcontrollers;autonomous pill dispenser;tablet medication delivery mechanization;Arduino-controlled consumer device;textured cone;Android application;HC-06 Bluetooth module;serial activation signal;pill type;pill diameter;SMS notification;Androids;Humanoid robots;Bluetooth;DC motors;Servomotors;Consumer electronics;Testing;Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Robotic and Autonomous systems;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Arduino;Mobile computing;Wireless computing;Bluetooth integration;Patient care;Microcontroller;Medication control;Medication scheduling;Internet of Things;Android;Application},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777886},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In disaster scenarios, such as an area after a terrorist attack, security is a significant problem since communications involve information for the rescue officers, such as polices, militaries, emergency medical technicians and the survivors. Such information is critically important for the rescue organizations; and protecting the privacy of the survivors is required. Normally, authenticated key exchange (AKE) is an underlying approach for security. However, available AKE protocols are either inconvenient or infeasible in disaster areas due to the very nature of disasters. To address the security problem in disaster scenarios, we propose two pairing-free identity-based AKE protocols that have unbalanced computational requirements on the two parties. Compared with existing AKE protocols, the proposed protocols have a number of advantages in disaster scenarios: 1) They are more convenient than symmetric cryptography-based AKE protocols since they do not require any pre-shared secret between the parties; 2) They are more feasible than asymmetric cryptography-based AKE protocols since they do not require any online server; 3) They are more friendly to battery-powered and computationally limited devices than pairing-based and pairing-free identity-based AKE protocols since they do not involve any bilinear pairing (a time-consuming operation), and have lower computational requirement on the limited party. Security of the proposed protocols are analyzed in detail; and prototypes of them are implemented to evaluate the performance. We also illustrate the application of the protocols through a vivid use case in a terrorist attack scenario.},   keywords={Protocols;Organizations;Public key;Elliptic curves;Servers;authenticated key exchange;ID-based cryptography;pairing-free;unbalanced computational requirements;disaster scenarios.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2864219},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={This paper presents a minimum complexity hand movement recognition algorithm based on Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) technique. It exploits the number of threshold-crossing events, generated by a full-custom acquisition board, from the surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals of three forearm muscles to detect four different movements of the wrist: flexion, extension, abduction and grasp. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has been trained with the signals acquired from ten subjects, who repeated ten times each gesture. To avoid correlation between training and testing dataset, the Leave One Subject Out (LOSO) cross-validation technique has been chosen. The average ATC classifier's accuracy is 92.87 %, only 5.34 % below the results obtained feeding the same model with the sEMG features extracted from the raw sampled signals. The total latency of the algorithm, from the acquisition to the prediction, is 160 ms. Power consumption was considered too: with less than the power budget for one sampled sEMG channel, it is possible to acquire and transmit (through a Bluetooth low energy module) the event-driven data of four sEMG channels, with an effective data rate of only 28 &lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={386-387},   abstract={Fog computing is a recently proposed computing paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for time-sensitive healthcare applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early notification of emergency situations to support smart decision making. While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications. In this work, we present dynamic Fog, a high level programming model for time-sensitive applications that are geospatially distributed, large-scale, and latency-sensitive. We also analyze our fog model with healthcare data, more specifically with Heartrate data that is one of the most time-sensitive medical data which deals with life and death situations. Our experiments show that our proposed system achieves minimum delay while it also achieves the data accuracy and data consistency which are very important in many applications like medical data.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;mobile handsets;fog networks;cloud computing;time-sensitive healthcare applications;smart decision making;real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system;fog-based cloud paradigm;time-sensitive medical applications;mobile devices;sensor devices;Internet of Things;IoT;future Internet applications;heartrate data;data accuracy;data consistency;medical data;Medical services;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Logic gates;Delays;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Fog networks; Healthcare data; IoT; Delay;},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2016.065},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

However, based on traditional classification criteria is not accurate. With the rapid development of computer information technology, computer technology is vital for the analysis of fetal heart rate in electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). FHR is divided into three classes as normal, suspicious and abnormal. Through the cooperation with the hospital, we got 4473 records, including 3012 normal, 1024 suspicious, 437 abnormal records by our EFM system. In order to improve the accuracy of fetal status assessment, high one-dimensional FHR records are divided into ten d-window segments, and then use convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the data in parallel. Finally, we use the voting method to determine the class of fetal heart rate records. We also made a comparative experiment, the feature extraction method based on basic statistics is used to extract the features of FHR. And then the features were applied as the input to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) to classify.

Detailed exploration of the unique features in respiration signals using noncontact CW Doppler radar are presented. A proposed dynamic segmentation technique allowed detection of various unique features and patterns.

However, there are certain risks related to age such as falls, blood pressure or heart problems among others, that can result in serious consequences to the person. The objective of this study is the development of a system oriented IoT, which can be acquired by the low income population, allowing any member of the family to do a remote following up. One of the most serious problems is the falls.

However, ULV brings serious leakage energy, throughput reduction, and delay variation issues. Parallel bit-serialization remarkably reduces leakage energy and enhances area efficiency; however, extremely reduced critical path aggravates delay variation makes bit-serial operation not feasible to ULV design. In this paper, we propose a balanced-bit-serial adder (BBSA) as a basic unit of parallel-balanced-bit-serialization (PBBS) operation, which leverages timing borrowing to mitigate delay variation. In addition, we propose two latches to improve the effectiveness of timing borrowing and ease the area and power overhead of BBSA. The proposed BBSA is verified in TSMC 40-nm CMOS technology. Compared with the flip-flop-based bit-serial adder, energy consumption of BBSA is saved by 40% and area efficiency is improved by 15% as well. As a practical demonstration, we present a reconfigurable PBBS single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vector processing tile.

The success of these threats is based on the assumption that biological attacks are invisible and will not be rapidly recognized as deliberate attacks.

At the micro-level, monitored humans are equipped with personal agents that are responsible for capturing the data transmitted by the wearable sensors, performing basic processing and analysis, and transmitting the collected data to higher-level agents for further processing.

The aim of this work is to improve edges of brain MRI by incorporating the gradient information of another contrast high-resolution image. Methods: Multi-contrast images are assumed to possess the same gradient direction in a local pattern. We proposed to establish a relation model of gradient value between different contrast images, to restore a high-resolution image from its input low-resolution version. The similarity of image patches is employed to estimate intensity parameters, leading a more accurate reconstructed image. Then, iterative back-projection filter is applied to the reconstructed image to further increase image quality. Results: The new approach is verified on synthetic and real brain MRI images, and achieves higher visual quality and higher objective quality criteria than the compared state-of-the-art super-resolution approaches. Conclusion: The gradient information of the multi-contrast MRI images is very useful. With a proper relation model, the proposed method enhances image edges in MRI image super-resolution. Significance: Improve the MRI image resolution from very low-resolution observations is challenging. We tackle this problem by first modeling the relation of gradient value in multi-contrast MRI and then performing fast supper-resolution methods. This relation model may be helpful for other MRI reconstruction problems.},   keywords={Magnetic resonance imaging;Image resolution;Image edge detection;Interpolation;Brain modeling;Image reconstruction;Remote sensing;MRI;image reconstruction;super-resolution;multi-contrast images},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873484},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, individual privacy is generally overlooked in the prediction process and transmission stage of opportunistic CoT. In this paper, we construct a privacy-preserving message forwarding framework for opportunistic CoT to guarantee individual privacy and improve transmission efficiency. We first set up a two-layer architecture of a cloud server to improve communication efficiency for terminal clients. By integrating a security-based mobility prediction algorithm with a routing decision process, our scheme can effectively protect individual privacy.

In case of smart health, we need to help patients and healthcare practitioners manage their appointment easier. Nowadays, there are many patients who are receiving treatment for diseases in hospitals and this tends to be increase in every year. In some diseases, doctor needs to follow-up the patient symptom continuously so that the doctor makes a follow-up appointment for the next treatment. Some hospitals currently have no patient appointment reminder when the appointment is coming while some hospitals remind their patients via either telephones or short message service (SMS). This results in costs and can be errors in the appointment reminder. This paper proposes an automated patient appointment reminder for cross-platform mobile application. The patients can receive appointment notification before the appointment date, be able to postpone or cancel the appointment easily when they cannot come to see the doctor or the patient get better. In addition, the doctors and patients can observe their appointment via mobile application.

In addition, it is very difficult to avoid the interference of external factors in the process of collecting infrared image, which can form variety thermal noise. So the infrared image noise reduction processing is very necessary. But the image is still in a relatively narrow range after the noise reduction, so using image enhancement algorithm to deal with the infrared image is necessary. Through the comparison analysis, it is found that the weighted histogram equalization algorithm in the enhancement of image contrast, which can not only retains the shape and trend of the original gray histogram, but also retains image details to a large extent.

With different operating conditions, interference, obstacles and type of building materials used, it is difficult to predict the path loss components in an indoor environment, which are crucial for the network design. It has been observed that the indoor path loss models proposed for western countries cannot be directly used in Indian scenarios due to variations in building materials utilized, floor plans, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a non-deterministic statistical indoor path loss model-Tata Indoor Path Loss Model (T-IPLM) which can be used for the 2.4-2.5 GHz, Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. To propose and validate, we have conducted several drive tests with different conditions such as busy office premise with obstacles, open office premise, corridor, canteen, and multistorey office locations, etc. We have also compared T-IPLM with popular path loss models such as ITU-R and Log-distance; T-IPLM matches closely with the drive test results as compared to other models. We believe that T-IPLM model can be used extensively to design accurate indoor communication networks required for regular WiFi communications and deployment and operations of IoT and cloud robotics.},   keywords={building materials;indoor radio;statistical analysis;wireless LAN;building materials;path loss components;indoor environment;indoor path loss models;popular path loss models;T-IPLM model;regular WiFi communications;realistic indoor path loss;regular WiFi operations;cloud robotics;operating conditions;indoor wireless communication;Tata indoor path loss model;nondeterministic statistical indoor path loss model;indoor communication networks;IoT;Internet of Things;frequency 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz;Propagation losses;Wireless fidelity;Receivers;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Buildings;Transmitters},   doi={10.1109/NCC.2017.8077107},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.},   keywords={artificial intelligence;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;social networking (online);diagnostic tools;augmented intelligence;sensor devices;gateway;evidence-based medicine system;SMEAD;end-to-end secured system;diabetic patients;medication;insulin dosage;cryptographic security;formalized data access;secured mobile enabled assisting device;wearable health devices;mobile apps;cloud-based platforms;Internet of Things;MEDIBOX;blockchain-based disruptive technology;smart contracts;social networks;diabetics monitoring;patient assisting devices;privacy;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diabetes;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security;Temperature sensors;Diabetics Monitoring;MEDIBOX;Blockchain;IOT;Mobile Phone},   doi={10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384099},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Apart from helping the doctor monitor the patient's basic health parameters this health monitoring system also ensures that the patient takes the prescribed medication at the right times. The raspberry pi acts as a personal server which logs the details of the patient's medication. The patient is sent reminders to take medicines through SMS according to his prescription.},   keywords={diseases;health care;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment;heart diseases;heart strokes;hospital centric treatment;patient centric treatment;health monitoring system;heart rate;raspberry pi board;hospital centric healthcare system;chronic diseases;Medical services;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Databases;Heart beat;Raspberry Pi;Internet of Things;health monitoring system},   doi={10.1109/BID.2017.8336583},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Privacy Preservation in e-Healthcare Environments: State of the Art and Future Directions}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={464-478},   abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity, and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end-to-end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks, to incorporating the Internet of Things, to communication links, and to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise are of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level toward the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision making regarding their protected health information/electronic health record. A lot of works and efforts are necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, and identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;medical information systems;data privacy;patient privacy;e-Healthcare systems;e-Healthcare enterprise;end-to-end privacy;healthcare services;Privacy;Medical services;Electronic mail;Wireless sensor networks;Access control;Data privacy;e-Healthcare;privacy;anonymity;access control},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767561},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Furthermore, in order to optimize the energy consumption in these monitoring systems, compression techniques have been widely deployed. Compressive sensing (CS) has gained a lot of attention in ECG monitoring as a result of its ability to leverage the ECG signal structure in order to achieve a high efficient acquisition scheme. The paper investigates the incorporation of CS in IoT-based ECG monitoring platforms. The platform consists of a CS-based compression and recovery, in addition, the platform provides an abnormality detection for each heart beat using different pattern recognition algorithms. The obtained results reveal that transmitting only 15 % of the samples is enough to recover the signal efficiently. Moreover, using up to 20% of the total sample can achieve a high classification accuracy as using the original data with a maximum drop down of 3.3 % in the worst case scenario.},   keywords={cardiovascular system;compressed sensing;diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern recognition;electrocardiogram monitoring;monitoring systems;compression techniques;ECG monitoring platforms;IoT based compressive sensing;remote monitoring;chronic cardiovascular diseases;ECG signal structure;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sensors;Compressed sensing;Correlation;Sparse matrices;Internet of things(IoT);connected health;ECG;compressive sensing (CS);Classification},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.32},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

More other diseases such as chickenpox, malaria, etc. are also serious threat to people's physical and mental health. Therefore proper techniques for disease surveillance are highly demanded. Recently, social media analysis is regarded as an efficient way to achieve this goal, which is feasible since growing number of people post their health information to social media such as blogs, personal website, etc. Previous work on social media analysis mainly focused on English materials but hardly considered Chinese materials, which hinders the use of such technique for Chinese people. In this paper, we proposed a new method of Chinese social media analysis for disease surveillance. More specifically, we compared different kinds of methods in the process of classification, and then proposed a new way to process Chinese text data. The Chinese Sina micro-blog data collected from September to December 2013 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that a high classification precision of 87.49% in average is obtained. Comparing with the data from the authority, Chinese national influenza center, we can predict the outbreak time of flu 5 days earlier.},   keywords={diseases;medical information systems;natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis;deaths;seasonal flu;chickenpox;malaria;physical health;mental health;disease surveillance;health information;blogs;personal Website;Chinese social media analysis;classification process;Chinese text data;Chinese Sina microblog data;classification precision;Chinese national influenza center;outbreak time prediction;Media;Diseases;Support vector machines;Surveillance;Blogs;Influenza;Internet;KeywordsSocial media; Chinese;SVMLIGHT;},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2014.11},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks. We evaluated both protocols through a specific e-health scenario. Tests revealed the usage of mobile networks increases response time and overhead of both protocols, on average, when compared to traditional networks.},   keywords={computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;middleware;protocols;radiocommunication;TLS protocols;DTLS protocols;IoT middleware systems;Internet of Things;communication services;mobile networks;IoT applications;e-health applications;communication layer;IoT systems;e-health environment;network latency;packet loss;Middleware;Protocols;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Authentication;Time factors},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983155},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

Low cost, tiny, battery, or batteryless operated position sensors are required. 3-D localization can be computed by combining three or more distance measurements between sensor and reference points. Our aim is to give the capability of measuring the distance from a reference point to radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. The main challenge is in the estimation of the distances with millimeter accuracy in presence of both size and power supply strict constraints, and thus with very limited computational power. An accurate ranging technique using cross-correlation and small RFID-based sensors is proposed. Its originality resides in moving the main computational efforts from the sensor to an external processing unit with sufficient computational and supply power, thus overcoming the sensor limits. The system is composed of a beacon that emits ultrasound chirps and RF sync signals, a RFID-based distance sensor, a commercial RFID reader, and a processing unit. Main advantages are the high miniaturization and low power consumption of the remote sensor, and its compatibility with existing RFID standards.},   keywords={distance measurement;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;ultrasonic devices;indoor tracking;IoT paradigm;size constraint;indoor localization;batteryless operated position sensors;power supply strict constraint;RFID-based distance sensor;RF sync signals;RFID standards;remote sensor;low power consumption;high miniaturization;commercial RFID reader;ultrasound chirps;sensor limits;external processing unit;originality resides;cross-correlation;accurate ranging technique;computational power;radio frequency identification tags;reference point;distance measurements;3-D localization;domotics;gesture interfaces;medical monitoring;centimeter-level accuracy;RFID tags;Distance measurement;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustics;RFID tags;Chirp;Ultrasound ranging;RFID tag;IoT smart devices ranging;ultrasound chirp;cross-correlation technique},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2018.2806564},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={April},}

Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile.

Reliability is one of the most important characteristics of an IoT system which should be satisfied with high consideration. The way how IoT devices communicate with each other in different layers of architecture, plays an important role in building a reliable IoT infrastructure. Maintaining the desired level of reliability in IoT applications through application layer protocols, imposes a noticeable amount of overhead to different characteristics of IoT systems. In this paper, we are going to investigate these overheads through practical evaluations on a conventional IoT infrastructure. To this end, we will compare two well-known application layer protocols, i.e., MQTT with many reliable features and CoAP with fewer reliability mechanisms, from different aspects. Conducted experiments in Arduino test-beds illustrate while MQTT provides more reliable and predictable infrastructure for IoT devices, on average, it imposes 364uW of more power consumption than CoAP for delivering the same amount of data. Furthermore, utilizing MQTT as a reliable application layer protocol, imposes 4.99x of more latency in comparison with CoAP.},   keywords={Internet of Things;protocols;IoT devices;safety-critical applications;IoT system;reliable application layer protocol;Internet of Things application layer protocols;MQTT;Protocols;Reliability;Quality of service;Power demand;Transmitters;Medical services;Energy consumption;internet of things;reliability;power consumption;performance;protocol;application;CoAP;MQTT},   doi={10.1109/ICSRS.2017.8272822},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Firstly, the salience of particular small objects is calculated to find candidates of small objects. Next, the Hough Transform is performed on an enhanced RSI constrained by the size of small size to identify small objects from others, such as highway fragment, river fragment, house and farmland and so on. The experiments results regarding small reservoir segmentation show that the method has high robustness and generalization ability, and the idea of classification can be used to the automatic interpreting process of other kind of small objects of RSI.},   keywords={feature extraction;Hough transforms;image segmentation;object recognition;remote sensing;targets segmentation;remote sensing image;RSI;object recognition;salience detection;Hough transform;Image resolution;Image segmentation;Sensors;Encoding;remote sensing image;small object recognition;saliency detection;Hough Transform},   doi={10.1109/ICAIOT.2015.7111562},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={The pervasive computing discipline has evolved substantially since its inception. A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Nowadays smartphones are ubiquitous in various aspects of our lives. The processing power, communication bandwidth, and the memory capacity of these devices have surged considerably in recent years. Besides, the variety of sensor types, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, humidity sensor, and bio-sensors, which are embedded in these devices, opens a new horizon in self-monitoring of physical daily activities. One of the primary steps for any research in the area of detecting daily life activities is to test a detection method on benchmark datasets. Most of the early datasets limited their work to collecting only a single type of sensor data such as accelerometer data. While some others do not consider age, weight, and gender of the subjects who have participated in collecting their activity data. Finally, part of the previous works collected data without considering the smartphone's position. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, called Position-Aware Multi-Sensor (PAMS). The dataset contains both accelerometer and gyroscope data. The gyroscope data boosts the accuracy of activity recognition methods as well as enabling them to detect a wider range of activities. We also take the user information into account. Based on the biometric attributes of the participants, a separate learned model is generated to analyze their activities. We concentrate on several major activities, including sitting, standing, walking, running, ascending/descending stairs, and cycling. To evaluate the dataset, we use various classifiers, and the outputs are compared to the WISDM. The results show that using aforementioned classifiers, the average precision for all activities is above 88.5%.

These service providers require access to a wide range of personal data, which are often sensitive. In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving trust model based on the observation that a large class of applications can be provisioned based on simple threshold detection. The key issue we address in this work is how to minimize privacy loss in the presence of untrusted service providers so that providers are prevented from disclosing information to third parties for secondary uses. Our work can be considered as a lightweight approach to functional encryption (FE) for privacy-preservation. The main algorithm in the proposed model is a uniformization scheme that uses a combination of sensor aliases to hide the identity of the sensing source and per-function initialization vector to reveal information only to relevant service providers. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed scheme on TelsoB, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed scheme on resource-constrained devices.},   keywords={cryptography;data privacy;Internet of Things;privacy-preserving access;sensor data;IoT based service;lightweight privacy-preserving trust model;privacy loss minimization;functional encryption;uniformization scheme;TelsoB;resource-constrained device;Internet of Things;Privacy;Data privacy;Encryption;Servers;Mutual information;Medical services},   doi={10.1109/COMSNETS.2016.7439941},   ISSN={2155-2509},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Increasingly, Internet of Things (IoT) domains, such as sensor networks, smart cities, and social networks, generate vast amounts of data. Such data are not only unbounded and rapidly evolving. Rather, the content thereof dynamically evolves over time, often in unforeseen ways. These variations are due to so-called concept drifts, caused by changes in the underlying data generation mechanisms. In a classification setting, concept drift causes the previously learned models to become inaccurate, unsafe and even unusable. Accordingly, concept drifts need to be detected, and handled, as soon as possible. In medical applications and emergency response settings, for example, change in behaviours should be detected in near real-time, to avoid potential loss of life. To this end, we introduce the McDiarmid Drift Detection Method (MDDM), which utilizes McDiarmid’s inequality [1] in order to detect concept drift. The MDDM approach proceeds by sliding a window over prediction results, and associate window entries with weights. Higher weights are assigned to the most recent entries, in order to emphasize their importance. As instances are processed, the detection algorithm compares a weighted mean of elements inside the sliding window with the maximum weighted mean observed so far. A significant difference between the two weighted means, upper-bounded by the McDiarmid inequality, implies a concept drift. Our extensive experimentation against synthetic and real-world data streams show that our novel method outperforms the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MDDM yields shorter detection delays as well as lower false negative rates, while maintaining high classification accuracies.},   keywords={Microsoft Windows;Adaptive learning;Probability distribution;Real-time systems;Delays;Adaptation models;Memory management},   doi={10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489260},   ISSN={2161-4407},   month={July},}

Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;adaptive LPA validation model;LPAV-IoT;data reliability;IoT healthcare environments;mobile apps;LPA data;IoT environment;data validation model;lifelogging data;personal data;healthcare studies;healthcare system;personalized healthcare platform;lifelogging physical activity;Internet of things;Medical services;Uncertainty;Biomedical monitoring;Adaptation models;Reliability;Data models;Data validation;Internet of Things (IoT);personalized healthcare;physical activity},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2016.2586075},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={4},   pages={24-32},   abstract={With the evolution of the Internet of Things, mutual sharing of information becomes easy among various smart devices across the globe. In such an environment, smart healthcare also needs to be expedited with an aim to provide remote diagnosis to patients located across the globe. However, as the sensitive information about a patient travels using an open channel (i.e., the Internet), there are chances of misusing this information. Hence, there is a requirement for a strong crypto mechanism for securely processing smart healthcare data. Most of the solutions reported in the literature use heavy computation-based solutions for providing security to smart healthcare data, which may not be suitable in view of less resources for modern smart devices. In this article, we propose a novel lattice-based secure cryptosystem for smart healthcare (LSCSH) in future smart cities. LSCSH uses a lightweight key exchange and an authentication mechanism at several stages. The proposed scheme has been evaluated with respect to the communication and computation costs in comparison to the other competitive schemes.

Recently, many research results of IoT related to emergency system, smart building and medical system, etc. The key for IoT applications are the ability to interact with physical world through computation, communication, and machine control. However, each sensor device in IoT cannot conveniently communicate with other terminal devices through internet protocol. So, it is necessary to establish protocol translation stack or equipment between two WSN groups. That is very inefficient and high overhead cost of network construction. The development of micro-IP (uIP) solves this problem. The uIP reduce cost of protocol translation and it also realizes the machine to machine (M2M) concept in wireless sensor network. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution for porting uIP library to the wireless sensor network devices and presents the integration of a speaker module and IPv6 ready sensor device.

Though controlling pollution is a broad topic, but preventing oneself from asthma is an easier way out. It is important to keep track of what triggers asthma attack in a patient, because symptoms do not occur right after the exposure to the triggering parameters.

The vulnerability is commonly known as Heartbleed bug that caused vulnerability in more than 16% of the total webservers. The Heartbleed bug can cause a leakage of 64K memory bytes of memory in plaintext that may contain security keys, X.509 certificates and user's private data. OpenSSL is also used to secure connected embedded devices. The Heartbleed vulnerability has greater impact on embedded systems/IoT because the few KBs or MBs memory of embedded device can be leaked in few seconds during a well-crafted Heartbleed attack. This research demonstrates a Heartbleed attack, and develops a patch for Heartbleed vulnerability. This research proposes an update to RFC-6520 that can be used as Heartbleed patch for embedded systems. The Memory utilization analysis of the developed Heartbleed patch, new proposed Heartbleed patch &amp;amp; unpatched OpenSSL code for STM32 Cortex-M4 microcontroller.},   keywords={embedded systems;Internet of Things;microcontrollers;security of data;OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability;embedded system;Stuxnet computer attack;Iranian nuclear program;cybersecurity;Internet-of-Things;IoT;information security;memory bound check failure vulnerability;Heartbleed bug;STM32 Cortex-M4 microcontroller;memory utilization analysis;Microcontrollers;Google;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Heart beat;Security;Payloads},   doi={10.1109/INMIC.2014.7097358},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={56},   number={2},   pages={163-168},   abstract={In IoT-based healthcare, medical devices are more vulnerable to numerous security threats and attacks than other network devices. Current solutions are able to provide protection to patients' data during data transmission to some extent, but cannot prevent some sophisticated threats and attacks such as collusion attacks and data leakage. In this article, we first investigate the challenges with privacy protected data collection. Then we propose a practical framework called PrivacyProtector, patient privacy protected data collection, with the objective of preventing these types of attacks. PrivacyProtector includes the ideas of secret sharing and share repairing (in case of data loss or compromise) for patients' data privacy. Since it is the first time, we apply the Slepian- Wolf-coding-based secret sharing (SW-SSS) in PrivacyProtector. In the framework, we use a distributed database consisting of multiple cloud servers, which ensures that the privacy of patients' personal data can remain protected as long as one of the servers remains uncompromised. We also present a patient access control scheme in which multiple cloud servers collaborate in shared construction to offer patients' data to healthcare providers without revealing the content of the data. The privacy performance analysis has shown that the PrivacyProtector framework is secure and privacy-protected against various attacks.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;collusion attacks;data leakage;privacy protected data collection;patient privacy;data loss;patient access control scheme;healthcare providers;privacy performance analysis;PrivacyProtector framework;privacy-protected patient data collection;IoT;healthcare systems;medical devices;network devices;data transmission;cloud servers;security threats;Slepian-Wolf-coding-based secret sharing;Cryptography;Servers;Medical services;Data privacy;Maintenance engineering;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700364},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={Feb},}

Blood centers collect, process and transport blood to hospitals and other health care centers. Sometimes blood is collected directly from blood donors rather than taking it from blood bank. Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases. The proposed system is a web based application which helps to reduce the human mistakes or errors and different techniques can be applied for blood type classification, diagnosing diabetic symptoms, classifying blood type and identifying different donors reaction and apply preventive measures against them.},   keywords={data mining;health care;Internet;medical information systems;pattern recognition;safety;DonorHART system;blood donor safety;donor reactions information;risk monitoring;automatic pattern recognition;Web based application;data mining;Blood;Data mining;Classification algorithms;Safety;Cloud computing;Pattern matching;Machine learning algorithms;Blood Bank;DonorHart tool;Data Mining;Database;Classification algorithm},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380516},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Based upon the analysis of QRS frequency, the slope and the threshold decision, the improved algorithm can reliably recognize R peak of QRS complexes. Compared to the traditional Pan-Tompkins, there are three improvements. First one is accurately calculating heart rate even in a slow-moving state; another is wider sampling rate-500 and 1000 sampling rate or any other sampling rate; the last one is effectively avoiding the finite word-length effect during calculation in float type.

Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={A number of apps currently exist to aid users in finding a better lifestyle or to control their food intake by having better nutritional advice at their fingertips. The mobile nutrition area is widely popular with thousands of people around the world accessing information related to nutrition and wellbeing. However, mobile nutrition apps still can offer more to their users by providing better overall Human Device Interaction (HDI). As nutrition apps are used daily, it is imperative to ensure that users can easily grasp their concept, thus allowing them to quickly understand and receive the information they require to achieve a better lifestyle. The problem lies with HDI elements associated with these apps. This research paper highlights the problems with HDI in mobile nutrition apps through an investigative survey. The questionnaire based quantitative survey was used to understand the patterns associated with mobile HDI in the nutrition landscape and how the user interacts with the mobile app throughout the nutrition tracking process. Respondents clearly showed that the following main problems: difficult to input information into the mobile app, too time consuming to complete, not motivated in any way and also a poor overall user interface. The survey results have enabled us to conclude a number of points that greatly impact the overall HDI of nutrition apps. This was of great importance as it laid the foundations to investigate and explore further opportunities in this area.},   keywords={human computer interaction;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;smart phones;human-device interaction patterns;mobile nutrition context;mobile nutrition area;mobile nutrition application;mobile HDI elements;nutrition tracking process;human computer interaction;Mobile communication;Tracking;Image recognition;Context;Real-time systems;Three-dimensional displays;Bridges;human computer interaction;mobile computing;biomedical monitoring;patient monitoring;internet of things},   doi={10.1109/RAECS.2015.7453410},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

In this context, this paper proposes an architecture that considers the use of different types of health managers and gateways, but keeping interoperability by the use of widely adopted standards. The main contribution of this work is the distribution of health managers in different locations, such as mobile devices and cloud applications, enabling the use of a single health service for different types of PHDs. The ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is used as core technology, enabling the transport of PHD information over different technologies and protocols.

It uses Google open source word vector tool word2vec to train text and map the words into abstracted n-dimensional vector space. We can get the latent semantic relations between words and words in the corpus. And then combining the information entropy and word frequency, we can find new words. Finally, we design information extraction rules to get the key information according to the new words, and organize them into structured data.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internet-of-Things applications. Wearables leverage computational and machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from scratch upon any changes in the configuration of the network. Retraining of these algorithms requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and infeasible. We propose an approach for automatic retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our real-time multi-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an accuracy of 80.66% in activity recognition, which is an improvement of 15.96% in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node. This performance is only 7.96% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.},   keywords={Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);plug-n-learn;human-centered Internet-of-Things;wearable technology;machine learning;multiview autonomous learning approach;Training data;Machine learning algorithms;Labeling;Real-time systems;Internet of things;Training},   doi={10.1145/2897937.2898066},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={362-369},   abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in communication technologies have enabled homes, cars even whole cities to be network connected. However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can be considered as a promising solution for detecting, reporting emergency events, eliminating the hoax calls and responding swiftly saving lives.},   keywords={diseases;emergency services;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;IoT automated SIP;emergency call triggering system;communication technologies;emergency incident;IoT devices;healthcare providers;support session-oriented communications;emergency services;public safety stakeholders;IoTA framework;automatically emergency calls;emergency events;general eHealth;bi-directional communication sessions;Medical services;Emergency services;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Conferences;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;emergency calls;Internet of Things;IoT;sensor devices;IP communication session;SIP based calls;eHealth;seizure},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115830},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming a reality, power-efficient techniques are crucial to achieve sufficient battery lifetimes. Whereas current medical IoT devices typically acquire data with a constant quality, we propose an architecture that dynamically adjusts the data quality adaptively based on the current medical condition of the subject being monitored. Since transmission and processing make up a large fraction of the energy consumption, the reduction of the link traffic and processing effort caused by such an adjustment results in a decreased energy consumption of the devices. For example, if anomalies in the monitored data are detected, the monitoring is performed with an increased granularity and more exhaustive processing. Further, not all data generated by the medical sensors needs to be transmitted during all times. Only if certain events are detected, the transmission of the complete data needs to be activated. In this paper, we present a novel approach for body-worn medical IoT devices. In particular, a generic, distributed architecture for the power-management of the whole system, which is based on dynamically switching services, is presented. We show that such an architecture can reduce the energy-consumption of medical sensors by up to 80 % in real-world measurements.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Internet of Things;medical computing;switching networks;dynamic service switching;Internet of Things;power-efficient techniques;battery lifetimes;data quality;link traffic;processing effort;granularity;exhaustive processing;body-worn medical IoT devices;generic distributed architecture;power-management;dynamically switching services;Sensors;Electrocardiography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Switches;Heart rate variability;Mobile communication},   doi={10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794845},   ISSN={2166-9589},   month={Sept},}

For example, personal medical privacy data can be easily leaked to insurance companies, which not only compromises the privacy of individuals, but also hinders the healthy development of the medical industry. With the continuous improvement of cloud computing and big data technologies, the Internet of Things technology has been rapidly developed. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is one of the core technologies of the Internet of Things. The application of the RFID system to the medical system can effectively solve this problem of medical privacy. RFID tags in the system can collect useful information and conduct data exchange and processing with a back-end server through the reader. The whole process of information interaction is mainly in the form of ciphertext. In the context of the Internet of Things, the paper presents a lightweight RFID medical privacy protection scheme. The scheme ensures security privacy of the collected data via secure authentication. The security analysis and evaluation of the scheme indicate that the protocol can effectively prevent the risk of medical privacy data being easily leaked.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data protection;electronic data interchange;Internet of Things;medical computing;radiofrequency identification;medical industry;big data technologies;radio frequency identification;RFID system;medical system;RFID tags;lightweight RFID medical privacy protection scheme;security privacy;collected data;lightweight RFID protocol;traditional medical privacy data;personal medical privacy data;insurance companies;Internet of Things technology;data exchange;IoT;cloud computing;data processing;back-end server;information interaction;ciphertext;secure authentication;security analysis;Privacy;Servers;Security;Data privacy;Medical services;RFID tags;Authentication;Internet of Things (IoT);lightweight;radio frequency identification (RFID);security and privacy},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2794996},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={April},}

Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems aim to connect and scale billions of devices in various domains such as transportation, industry, smart home/city, medical services, and energy systems. Different wireless and wired technologies link sensors and systems together, through wireless access points, gateways, and routers that in turn connect to the web and cloud-based intelligence. IoT architectures make great demands on network control methods for the efficient management of massive amounts of nodes and data. Therefore, some of the cloud's management tasks should be distributed around the edges of networked systems, utilizing fog computing to control and manage, e.g., network resources, quality, traffic prioritizations, and security. In this work, we present adaptive edge computing solutions based on regressive admission control (REAC) and fuzzy weighted queueing (FWQ) that monitor and react to network quality-of-service (QoS) changes within heterogeneous networks, and in a vehicular use case scenario utilizing IEEE 802.11p technology.

The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},   keywords={cryptography;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet;mobile computing;patient care;protocols;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;healthcare;elderly people;disable people;information and communication technologies;ICT;clinical process;Internet of things;context awareness;patient life;6LoWPAN network;RFID technology;NFC technology;secure communications;cryptographic SIM card;authentication;MIPv6 protocol;sensor networks;mobility;Internet;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Communications technology;Radiofrequency identification;Information security;Medical services;Senior citizens;Aging;Environmental management},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421661},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={47-50},   abstract={To evaluate the quality of a person's sleep it is essential to identify the sleep stages and their durations. Currently, the gold standard in terms of sleep analysis is overnight polysomnography (PSG), during which several techniques like EEG (eletroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram), EMG (electromyogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) and for example respiratory airflow and respiratory effort are recorded. These expensive and complex procedures, applied in sleep laboratories, are invasive and unfamiliar for the subjects and it is a reason why it might have an impact on the recorded data. These are the main reasons why low-cost home diagnostic systems are likely to be advantageous. Their aim is to reach a larger population by reducing the number of parameters recorded. Nowadays, many wearable devices promise to measure sleep quality using only the ECG and body-movement signals. This work presents an android application developed in order to proof the accuracy of an algorithm published in the sleep literature. The algorithm uses ECG and body movement recordings to estimate sleep stages. The pre-recorded signals fed into the algorithm have been taken from physionet1 online database. The obtained results have been compared with those of the standard method used in PSG.

The system consists of two bend sensors, one ultrasound sensor, Intel Edison, Minnow board, Bluetooth module, mobile application and a database system. Currently, gait analysis is carried out in a motion laboratory that provides a full analysis of the motion body segments using a super highly accurate computer. This method is expensive and not affordable for everyone, indeed it requires quite a lot of maintenances. Furthermore, gait analysis requires a specialist to conduct and examine the patients, which means patients have to pay a lot of visits to hospital just only to get a treatment and feedback from the doctor that resulted waste of time, energy and money. Thus, this project will introduce a new and advance ways solution in order to evaluate the gait parameters. In this project, it will focus on two types of gait parameters, which is plantar flexion and dorsiflexion.

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={19536-19561},   abstract={The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting every single object to the Internet with the purpose to automate every aspect of daily life. The IoT relies heavily on wireless low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) that collect information from the physical world and send the measurements to data aggregation and processing nodes. Most LLNs operate in the non-licensed industrial, scientific, and medical radio band, which is shared by a considerable number of systems. Coexisting wireless systems cause interference to each other, limiting their achievable performance. Multichannel communications enable frequency diversity, which in turn provides robustness against interference as well as increased network capacity. There is a considerable interest in multichannel medium access control (MAC) protocols for LLNs, including an evolving standard for the MAC layer of LLNs. In this paper, we review the latest advances in the topic and introduce a new classification framework for multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs. While our framework builds on previous review and classification studies, it adds aspects of a MAC protocol that reflect its interactions with the surrounding network stack. Seeing the resource constraints of the LLN devices, the study of such interactions-which is missing in prior classification efforts-can be the key for improving future designs. Relevant protocols published since 2006 are discussed and classified using the presented framework, including the recent multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs, such as the latest version of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for time slotted channel hopping.},   keywords={access protocols;Internet of Things;pattern classification;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels;Zigbee;IoT;data aggregation;processing nodes;medical radio band;wireless systems;multichannel communications;multichannel medium access control protocols;MAC layer;classification framework;classification studies;MAC protocol;prior classification efforts-can;relevant protocols;recent multichannel MAC;network capacity;network stack;multichannel MAC protocol classification;Internet of Things;LLN;wireless low-power lossy networks;nonlicensed industrial scientific and medical radio band;IEEE 802.15.4 standard;time slotted channel hopping;Media Access Protocol;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Mobile ad hoc networks;Wireless communication;Monitoring;LLN;multichannel MAC protocols;Internet of Things;classification framework},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2748178},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;health care;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;patient monitoring;pattern matching;real-time systems;signal classification;telemedicine;Web services;personalized healthcare;wearable systems;real-time ECG Classification;wearable biomedical devices;potential health hazards;timely medical treatment;modern wearable health monitoring devices;real-time analyses;ECG readings;arrhythmia classification;ECG waveforms;ECG equipment;machine learning phase;unique feature extraction method;prediction models;neuralnet fitting models;k-NN Classification models;misclassification error value;wearable devices;3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit;tele health analytical server;prediction tasks;trained classification models;ECG abnormalities;abnormal ECG events;Electronic Health Record;health care;cure institutions;Electrocardiography;Heart;Real-time systems;Databases;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Feature extraction;ECG classification;Wearable IoT;preventive health-care;real-time ECG;arrhythmia detection;arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB;Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;FHIR},   doi={10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively.

Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place. BPMN is lacking of the ability to model and present security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a suitable way.

 title={Secure Healthcare Data Dissemination Using Vehicle Relay Networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In the recent years, vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs) can be an attractive choice for collecting and transferring the healthcare data of the passengers to the remote healthcare centers. In VANETs, some of the intermediate nodes may act as relay nodes in which case, these networks are called as vehicular relay networks (VRNs). However, the transmitted information in VRNs can be captured by intruders during transmission. Moreover, an attacker can launch selective forwarding, blackhole and sinkhole attacks in the network, which may in turn degrade the network performance parameters like high end-to-end delay, low packet delivery ratio and network throughput. Hence, to address these issues, a secure data dissemination scheme using VRNs is proposed. In the proposed scheme, firstly, a secure vehicular medical relay network system is designed for the users belonging to disconnected rural areas. The collected information is filtered at zonal levels before transmission to a nearby road side units (RSUs), which further pass it to the incoming vehicles. Secondly, a secure passenger health monitoring network is designed which continuously monitors health services of the passengers traveling in different vehicles. The information collected through small body sensors installed in the vehicles act as data sets that is forwarded to the on-board monitoring unit within the vehicle. This collected data is then transmitted to centralized healthcare centers for processing by using VRNs. Lastly, a strong Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based cryptographic solution is designed for secure communication among different vehicles. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in various network scenarios with respect to different selected parameters, such as throughput, network delay, packet delivery ratio, jitter, transmission and computation overheads, and key distribution overhead. The obtained results indicate that the proposed scheme provides improvement of 52% in average delay and 5% in packet delivery ratio. This further indicates effective message delivery even with high mobility of the vehicles.},   keywords={Medical services;Data dissemination;Monitoring;Relay networks (telecommunications);Cryptography;Electronic mail;Vehicular relay network;Healthcare;Data dissemination;ECC;Body sensor networks;Security.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2865008},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

This paper proposes a vision for how we may build IoT systems in the future by reconceiving IoT's fundamental unit of construction not as a "thing", but rather as a widely and finely distributed "microservice" already familiar to web service engineering circles. Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles. Our hope is that the vision of a microservices approach will help focus research that can fill in current gaps preventing more effective, interoperable, and secure IoT services and solutions in a wide variety of contexts.},   keywords={application program interfaces;authorisation;Internet of Things;Web services;secure microservice framework;Internet of Things;Web service engineering circles;microservice architectures;IoT systems;microservices;API gateways;service distribution;uniform service discovery;access control;personal health management;connected autonomous vehicles;Cloud computing;Access control;Containers;Medical services},   doi={10.1109/SOSE.2017.27},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Each device gathers data and uploads it to servers via communication networks. Servers store the large volumes of received data in databases. Applications analyze this data and extract valuable information. Finally, based on this information, new services (in domains such as smart cities, public safety, e-commerce, medical, healthcare, or automobile) are provided. In this data flow, systems and applications in the upper layer trust the hardware in the lower layer, which includes data-gathering devices. If the collected information is intentionally modified by adversaries, services in the upper layer could be disrupted. Therefore, to ensure service continuity in the IoT, it is important to secure the hardware layer in which data are harvested and transmitted. In this paper, we focus on hardware-level security in IoT systems and classify the schemes proposed for physical security of IoT into three categories. We also provide examples for each of these and explain threats and countermeasures.},   keywords={computer network security;data privacy;Internet of Things;physical security;IoT systems;hardware-level security;service continuity;data-gathering devices;data flow;public safety;smart cities;communication networks;mobile devices;surveillance cameras;smart meters;electronic devices;IoT devices;EM information security;Internet of Things;Electromagnetic interference;Hardware;Trojan horses;Hafnium;EM information security;Internet of Things;Intentional electromagnetic interference;Hardware Trojan horse},   doi={10.1109/ISEMC.2018.8393878},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={As the Internet of Things becomes a reality, proliferation of wireless devices such as ZigBee nodes has accelerated. Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;},   keywords={ad hoc networks;Internet of Things;Zigbee;nonparametric feature generation;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee devices;Internet of Things;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;nonparametric classifier random forest;Zigbee;Signal to noise ratio;Authentication;Performance evaluation;Linear regression;Wireless communication},   doi={10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645},   ISSN={2329-6267},   month={May},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={This work proposes an ultralow power highly linear analog front-end (AFE) with an input dynamic range from 200μVpp to 20mVpp. The system consists of a signal conditioning instrumentation amplifier (IA), two programmable gain amplifiers (PGA), a mixed signal automatic gain control (AGC), two sample and hold (S/H), a 10 bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC), and a ΣΔ modulator with 10 bit effective number of bits (ENOB). A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32. The proposed system is intended to be powered by an energy scavenging circuit without compromising its own performance.

The mission in investigating an IoT crime is delivered by the dynamic nature of IOT solutions. Many predominant generation areas, which incorporates cloud computing, cellular gadgets, computer systems, sensors and RFID (Radio Frequency identification) technology are the combination of IOT. Forensic science is a mix of two Latin phrases: forensics and science. Forensic, relating to examination accomplished in public as trials in the ancient international were commonly held in public, it also consists of a robust judicial connotation. The second one termed as science, which is nowadays closely tied to the medical technique, also a systematic manner of obtaining knowledge. Collectively, forensic technology may be seen as the usage of the medical approaches and resources in crime solving. No matter its historical etymology, forensic science is something concrete but old fashioned. Branches of forensic science are rooted in nearly each department of technological knowledge and many different elements of current society. Due to its capability to discover nowadays it is identified as a critical part of the judicial world. At the same time as the key evidence in crook cases may additionally have come from witnesses or other subjective manner simply meaning forensic evidence, based as it is at the scientific method, is seen as more decisive than even eyewitness' testimony.

It helps to enable preventive care and promote automation to reduce the risk of human error. In Indonesia, mother and child health care is still an important agenda of the government because the maternal and child mortality rate is still high. This paper describes a preliminary design of IoT applications for supporting mother and child healthcare program. We reviewed government regulations and guidelines to determine the needs and used them as a starting point. Then we defined the networks (topology, architectures, and platform), service and application, security and technology used in the design. This multi-platform system design constitutes portable medical devices with multiple sensors for collecting medical data and sending them to server. A mobile application works as mobile gateway for the devices and as a portal for accessing context-aware personalized information related to patient's condition.

The medical cloud can distribute its own medical data to medical IoT devices via access points. Therefore, network disconnection can happen between the medical cloud and medical IoT devices when power/energy management in each access point is not efficient. This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance.},   keywords={cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network reliability;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical information systems;power aware computing;energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading;medical IoT platform;polynomial-time algorithm;medical cloud storage;medical Internet-of-Things devices;medical data distribution;access points;medical cloud devices;in-hospital network architecture;dynamic energy-efficient algorithm;power allocation;buffer backlog size;channel states;buffer stability;adaptive energy management;adaptive power management;network lifetime;Heuristic algorithms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Energy-Efficiency;Dynamic Buffering;Medical Platforms;Internet of Things;Dynamic buffering;energy efficiency;Internet of Things (IoT);medical platforms},   doi={10.1109/TII.2015.2434773},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={01},   number={},   pages={454-462},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly developing field and has the potential to significantly impact the healthcare industry. However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.},   keywords={analytic hierarchy process;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;multicriteria evaluation;Internet of Things;IoT;dementia care;chronic diseases;special needs;analytic hierarchy process;AHP;health care services;Dementia;Industries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Sensors;Internet of Things;e-Health;Dementia care;Assisted Living;Multicriteria evaluation},   doi={10.1109/CBI.2017.34},   ISSN={2378-1971},   month={July},}

The introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) and latest developments or improvements in E-health, pointed towards the fifth generation (5G) paradigm of health care application and services. This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data. Further, we propose a protocol stack for 5G-CCN WBAN to provide a secure, efficient and reliable E-health application services to meet the required needs of the current IP protocol stack and IoT devices.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;body area networks;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;IP networks;transport protocols;wireless medical sensor prototype;E-health care application record databases;unified communication framework;fifth generation network;fifth generation paradigm;Content-Centric networking based framework;wireless body area network;IP network;CCN router;5G-CCN WBAN;IP protocol stack;IoT devices;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Medical services;Servers;5G mobile communication;Wireless sensor networks;IP networks;Content-Centric Network;Wireless body area network;Caching;Healthcare;Internet-of-things},   doi={10.1109/ICIOTA.2017.8073614},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

As a resource constraint system providing critical health services, the EEG headset design must consider both high application fidelity and energy efficiency. However, through empirical studies with an off-the-shelf Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset, we uncover a mismatch between lossy EEG sensor communication and high neurometric application fidelity requirements. To tackle this problem, we study how to learn the sensitivity of neurometric application fidelity to EEG data. The learned sensitivity is used to develop two algorithms: 1) an energy minimization algorithm minimizing the energy usage in EEG sampling and networking while meeting applications' fidelity requirements and 2) a fidelity maximization algorithm maximizing the sum of all applications' fidelities through the incorporation and optimal utilization of a limited data buffer. The effectiveness of our proposed solutions is validated through trace-driven experiments.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;distributed sensors;electroencephalography;headphones;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;telemedicine;data sensitivity;neurometric fidelity;EEG sensing optimization;wireless neuroheadset electroencephalography neurometrics;ubiquitous physiological monitoring;human mental health;resource constraint system;critical health services;EEG headset design;energy efficiency;off-the-shelf Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset;lossy EEG sensor communication;high neurometric application fidelity sensitivity;energy minimization algorithm;EEG sampling;EEG networking;fidelity maximization algorithm;limited data buffer utilization;Electroencephalography;Wireless communication;Headphones;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Electrodes;Biomedical monitoring;Data sensitivity analysis;electroencephalography (EEG) sensors;energy efficiency;neurometric fidelity},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2322331},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively.

  year={2018},   volume={17},   number={8},   pages={1764-1777},   abstract={Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internet-of-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from scratch upon any changes in the configuration. Retraining of these algorithms requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose an approach for automatic retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. Our multi-view learning approach can be used in both online and batch modes. By applying the autonomous multi-view learning in the batch mode, we achieve an accuracy of 83.7 percent in activity recognition which is an improvement of 9.3 percent due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node. In addition to gain the less computation advantage of incremental training, the online learning algorithm results in an accuracy of 82.2 percent in activity recognition.},   keywords={data analysis;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);autonomous training;activity recognition algorithms;mobile sensors;transfer learning approach;context-invariant views;wearable technologies;human-centered Internet-of-Things applications;wearables leverage machine;physical activities;medical complications;large-scale utilization;labeled training data;labor-intensive;old sensor view;trained algorithms exist;multiview learning approach;autonomous multiview learning;automatic labeling;incremental training;online learning algorithm results;Wearable sensors;machine learning;transfer learning;computational autonomy;optimization},   doi={10.1109/TMC.2018.2789890},   ISSN={1536-1233},   month={Aug},}

By employing real-time e-health monitoring systems for acquiring, and analyzing bio-signals by measurements such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), it is possible to extract information to achieve better health-care in terms of observation, diagnosis, and treatment. However, those systems are limited in acquiring and sending data at high rates, are not energy efficient, or, are restricted in terms of portability due to large size and weight. In this paper, a compact portable bio-signal acquisition device for wearables has been designed and implemented. The developed hardware is capable of acquiring and reliably sending the data wirelessly at a high transfer rate in real-time while keeping the overall energy consumption low. Finally, the signal acquisition performance of the device has been evaluated for both ECG and EMG at 8 channel 24 bit resolution/channel 500 samples/s configuration. Measurement of energy consumption has been conducted using professional tool and it is found that the device can continuously work for up to 13.6 hours with a 3.7V 1700 mAh battery.

 title={The Rebirth of One-Time Pads—Secure Data Transmission from BAN to Sink}, 
  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={1},   pages={63-71},   abstract={Body area networks (BANs) consisting of small sensing and computing devices can help to improve medical care and well-being of humans. Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed-and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;wireless sensor networks;body area networks;BAN;secure data transmission;medical care;wireless link;cryptographic algorithms;one-time pads;memory technology;wireless sensor network;WSN;Encryption;Wireless sensor networks;Intelligent sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless sensors networks;Medical devices;Medical services;Computer security;Privacy;Body area networks;Security;Privacy;Encryption;Wireless Sensor Networks;Body Area Networks;One-Time Pad;Body area networks (BANs);encryption;one-time pad (OTP);privacy;security;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2378783},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

One of the most representative examples of artificial environments are buildings. Residential buildings (e.g. homes, apartment blocks) or dedicated public buildings (educational, medical, commercial, governmental) serve different purposes and needs, and therefore they have different characteristics and constraints. However, every building uses some form of resource (e.g. energy, water) in order to assure the required level of comfort, safety and conditions for carrying out the desired activities.

However, most of the existing dietary assessment methods rely on memory. With the help of pervasive mobile devices and rich cloud services, it is now possible to develop new computer-aided food recognition system for accurate dietary assessment. However, enabling this future Internet of Things-based dietary assessment imposes several fundamental challenges on algorithm development and system design. In this paper, we set to address these issues from the following two aspects: (1) to develop novel deep learning-based visual food recognition algorithms to achieve the best-in-class recognition accuracy; (2) to design a food recognition system employing edge computing-based service computing paradigm to overcome some inherent problems of traditional mobile cloud computing paradigm, such as unacceptable system latency and low battery life of mobile devices. We have conducted extensive experiments with real-world data. Our results have shown that the proposed system achieved three objectives: (1) outperforming existing work in terms of food recognition accuracy; (2) reducing response time that is equivalent to the minimum of the existing approaches; and (3) lowering energy consumption which is close to the minimum of the state-of-the-art.},   keywords={cloud computing;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;mobile radio;food recognition system;edge computing service infrastructure;accurate dietary assessment;existing dietary assessment methods;pervasive mobile devices;rich cloud services;visual food recognition algorithms;best-in-class recognition accuracy;service computing paradigm;traditional mobile cloud computing paradigm;unacceptable system;food recognition accuracy;deep learning;Algorithm design and analysis;Machine learning;Edge computing;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Time factors;Image recognition;Mobile applications;object recognition;deep learning;edge computing;food recognition},   doi={10.1109/TSC.2017.2662008},   ISSN={1939-1374},   month={March},}

IoT is used in many application areas like entertainment, medical, transport, agriculture, security, E-health, etc. even though there are many issues in IoT, one of the main issues during recent years is power management. The need for power management in smart homes focuses on reducing electricity cost and avoiding the high peak demand problems. For reducing electricity cost, another source of power can be used. The most preferable primary power unit will be solar power due to its availability in nature. This paper prioritizes the operation of power units. The proposed system consists of a controller, a photovoltaic system with battery, smart electrical appliance and smart communication network. The main use of the controller is to schedule the power units which may be solar power, battery power and grid supply. The proposed system uses Battery Energy Storage and Management (BESM) algorithm, which helped to reduce electricity cost. The smart controller works on BESM algorithm which picks up power units according to demand. There will be energy conversion from DC to AC so to improve quality of power, Selective Harmonic Elimination(SHE) method.

Various vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, and controls have been introduced for the new generation of CPS. However, there lacks a systematic review of the CPS security literature. In particular, the heterogeneity of CPS components and the diversity of CPS systems have made it difficult to study the problem with one generalized model. In this paper, we study and systematize existing research on CPS security under a unified framework. The framework consists of three orthogonal coordinates: 1) from the security perspective, we follow the well-known taxonomy of threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and controls; 2) from the CPS components perspective, we focus on cyber, physical, and cyberphysical components; and 3) from the CPS systems perspective, we explore general CPS features as well as representative systems (e.g., smart grids, medical CPS, and smart cars). The model can be both abstract to show general interactions of components in a CPS application, and specific to capture any details when needed. By doing so, we aim to build a model that is abstract enough to be applicable to various heterogeneous CPS applications; and to gain a modular view of the tightly coupled CPS components. Such abstract decoupling makes it possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight the potential sources of attacks and ways of protection. With this intensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the state-of-the-art on CPS security, provide researchers with a comprehensive list of references, and also encourage the audience to further explore this emerging field.},   keywords={cyber-physical systems;formal specification;security of data;smart power grids;coupled CPS components;CPS security literature;security challenges;cyber-physical systems security;heterogeneous CPS applications;CPS application;medical CPS;representative systems;general CPS features;CPS systems perspective;CPS components perspective;security perspective;Security;Cyber-physical systems;Smart grids;Integrated circuits;Computer security;Control systems;Wireless communication;Attacks;controls;cyber physical systems (CPSs);industrial control systems (ICSs);medical devices;security;smart cars;smart grids;threats;vulnerabilities},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2703172},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-10},   abstract={The exponentially increasing number of Internet of things (IoT) devices introduces spectrum crisis to the widely used industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. Since IoT devices use heterogeneous radios with different bandwidths (e.g., 20 MHz for WiFi and 2 MHz for ZigBee), traditional interference avoidance methods, such as time-division multiple access (TDMA) and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA), have very low spectrum utilization. This is because TDMA and CSMA allocate the packets at time domain, without considering the bandwidth difference of different IoT radios. To address this issue, we propose PMC, a novel communication system that enables parallel multi-protocol communication to heterogeneous IoT radios (i.e., WiFi and ZigBee) within a single WiFi channel. Our extensive evaluations show that PMC achieves the throughput of up to 121.02 kbit/s and 319.76 Mbit/s for parallel communication to ZigBee and WiFi, respectively. Compared with TDMA and CSMA, the spectrum utilization of PMC is increased by 2.3 and 1.8 times, respectively.},   keywords={carrier sense multiple access;interference suppression;Internet of Things;radiofrequency interference;time division multiple access;time-domain analysis;wireless channels;wireless LAN;Zigbee;PMC;parallel multiprotocol communication;heterogeneous IoT radios;single WiFi channel;spectrum crisis;IoT devices;heterogeneous radios;TDMA;carrier-sense multiple access;CSMA;time domain;bandwidth difference;different IoT radios;novel communication system;parallel communication;Internet of Things;time-division multiple access;ZigBee;Wireless fidelity;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Table lookup;Receivers;Spread spectrum communication},   doi={10.1109/ICNP.2017.8117550},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Human-centered Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications utilize computational algorithms such as machine learning and signal processing techniques to infer knowledge about important events such as physical activities and medical complications. The inference is typically based on data collected with wearable sensors or those embedded in the environment. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of these systems is that the computational algorithms cannot be shared between users or reused in contexts different than the setting in which the training data are collected. For example, an activity recognition algorithm trained for a wrist-band sensor cannot be used on a smartphone worn on the waist. We propose an approach for automatic detection of physical sensor-contexts (e.g., on-body sensor location) without need for collecting new labeled training data. Our techniques enable system designers and end-users to share and reuse computational algorithms that are trained under different contexts and data collection settings. We develop a framework to autonomously identify sensor-context. We propose a gating function to automatically activate the most accurate computational algorithm among a set of shared expert models. Our analysis based on real data collected with human subjects while performing 12 physical activities demonstrate that the accuracy of our multi-view learning is only 7.9% less than the experimental upper bound for activity recognition using a dynamic sensor constantly migrating from one on-body location to another. We also compare our approach with several mixture-of-experts models and transfer learning techniques and demonstrate that our approach outperforms algorithms in both categories.},   keywords={human factors;inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;autonomous sensor-context learning;dynamic human-centered Internet-of-Things environments;human-centered IoT;knowledge inference;computational algorithms;data collection;gating function;shared expert models;physical activities;multiview learning;upper bound;activity recognition;dynamic sensor;on-body location;mixture-of-expert model;transfer learning techniques;Context modeling;Context;Activity recognition;Signal processing algorithms;Computational modeling;Training;Heuristic algorithms},   doi={},   ISSN={1558-2434},   month={Nov},}

Deep learning technology, which has been used successfully in computer vision and language modeling, is finding application in new domains driven by the availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction that use deep learning technology to improve human health. However, timely and reliable transfer of large data streams (a requirement of deep learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralized locations, such as cloud datacenter environments, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies.

This paper addresses some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a secure digital camera integrated with the secure better portable graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this paper is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection, concurrent encryption and watermarking, which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management. The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: 1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image and 2) frequency-domain watermarking using blockwise DCT of size 8 × 8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant increase of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of our knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.},   keywords={cryptography;data compression;data privacy;discrete cosine transforms;emergency services;health care;image coding;image watermarking;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;trustworthy media communications;traditional healthcare;smart bio-sensors;on-body sensors;smart hospitals;smart emergency response systems;smart city;smart technology;information technology;IoT infrastructure;smart healthcare framework;hardware architecture;secure digital camera;patient data protection;SBPG architecture;privacy;compression technique BPG;compression quality;compressed file size;watermarking;compression processes;BPG compression;image authentication capability;secure portable graphics compression algorithm;image quality;secure communication;Medical services;Watermarking;Digital cameras;Image coding;Computer architecture;Smart healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);consumer electronics;secure digital camera;image communications;better portable graphics},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795478},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={2},   number={},   pages={384-385},   abstract={In many respects, farming and food processing have lagged other industries when it comes to adoption of innovative technology. Whilst bioengineering has brought about seeds with much higher yield and less need for water and nutrients, it is only now with IoT that farmers can work on the intensive use of natural resources to increase the sustainability of their operations. In the last ten years, high-end machinery has evolved primarily to the benefit of larger corporations, with the introduction of satellite driven machines, sensors and all components of precision farming. The most recent IoT advances bring about a level of simplification and cost reduction that enable all farmers to benefit and a true adoption of prescription agriculture. In this conference presentation, we will examine a practical case of a Malthouse, where careful modeling of how CO2, Temperature, Humidity and PH vary in the three steps of the malting process, enabled an artificial intelligence system to prescribe different setting and schedules. The end result is malt with higher content of starch and proteins, which in turn means higher alcohol in the downstream process. A second example on the cultivation of Medical Marijuana, where similarly but in a more complex fashion (138 variables) the artificial intelligence supported the tuning of many settings and schedules, is presented only in the conference.},   keywords={agricultural machinery;agriculture;artificial intelligence;cost reduction;farming;food processing industry;Internet of Things;food processing;innovative technology;bioengineering;seeds;higher yield;water;nutrients;farmers;natural resources;high-end machinery;larger corporations;satellite driven machines;precision farming;cost reduction;malting process;artificial intelligence system;downstream process;complex fashion the artificial intelligence;IoT solutions;food manufacturing;artificial intelligence applications;digital food;higher alcohol content;Artificial intelligence;Sensors;Schedules;Agriculture;Companies;Humidity;Proteins;IoT;Precision Farming;Prescriptive Farming},   doi={10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.157},   ISSN={0730-3157},   month={July},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Cloud-Assisted Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is one of the key emerging technology for medical applications in the era of Internet-of-Things. In cloud-assisted WBANs, the WBANs are able to access the cloud resources, which are geographically close to the local Access Points (APs). However, in the presence of poor radio link-quality between cloud-assisted WBANs and APs, energy consumption and service delay of the network dynamically changed. In order to solve this problem, we propose an energy-efficient Body-to-Body (B2B) communications among coexisting WBANs to relay the information of the patients to APs to provide real-time healthcare services. On the other hand, the healthcare services enabled for cloud-assisted WBANs is popularly known as Healthcare-as-a-Service (He-aaS). In He-aaS, it is very challenging to finalize a price agreement between WBANs and H-CSPs as WBANs follow a heterogeneous architecture. The existing pricing mechanisms, which are constrained to the homogeneous applications, are not compatible to He-aaS. We propose an optimal and dynamic pricing policy for He-aaS in order to increase the profit level of each WBAN with the consideration of the optimal QoS and energy. Extensive results indicate that our proposed schemes are able to efficiently utilize limited resource with optimal QoS and energy consideration.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Pricing;Body area networks;Medical services;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Delays;Wireless Body Area Networks;Cloud-Assisted B2B Communication;QoS;Distributed Pricing Policy},   doi={10.1109/TSC.2018.2841914},   ISSN={1939-1374},   month={},}

In IoT based healthcare, diverse distributed devices aggregate, analyse and communicate real time medical information to the cloud, thus making it possible to collect, store and analyse the large amount of data in several new forms and activate context based alarms. This novel information acquisition paradigm allows continuous and ubiquitous medical information access from any connected device over the Internet. As each one of the devices used in IoT are limited in battery power, it is optimal to minimise the power consumption to enhance the life of the healthcare system. This work explains the implementation of an IoT based In-hospital healthcare system using ZigBee mesh protocol.

Numerous studies have been carried out for accurately monitoring and assessing physical activity. Most attentions of these studies focus on designing standalone highly accurate wearable sensors or investigating advance machine learning algorithms to train these PA data in a controlled environment. But the wide use of cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps makes it possible to monitor and access PA into a more open and connective Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Yet, it still lacks of a systemic survey on how to effectively transfer classic PA monitoring and assessment (PAMA) technologies into a heterogeneous device connected IoT environment.

Such devices often require cryptographic services such as authentication, integrity and non-repudiation, which are provided by Public-Key Cryptography (PKC). As these devices are severely resource-constrained, choosing a suitable cryptographic system is challenging. Pairing Based Cryptography (PBC) is among the best candidates to implement PKC in lightweight devices. In this research, we present a fast and energy efficient implementation of PBC based on Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves and optimal Ate pairing using hardware/software co-design. Our solution consists of a hardware-based Montgomery multiplier, and pairing software running on an ARM Cortex A9 processor in a Zynq-7020 System-on-Chip (SoC). The multiplier is protected against simple power analysis (SPA) and differential power analysis (DPA), and can be instantiated with a variable number of processing elements (PE). Our solution improves performance (in terms of latency) over an open-source software PBC implementation by factors of 2.34 and 2.02, for 256- and 160-bit field sizes, respectively, as measured in the Zynq-7020 SoC.},   keywords={circuit optimisation;energy consumption;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;low-power electronics;multiplying circuits;public key cryptography;system-on-chip;cryptographic services;Public-Key Cryptography;PKC;lightweight devices;Barreto-Naehrig curves;optimal Ate pairing;Montgomery multiplier;ARM Cortex A9 processor;System-on-Chip;differential power analysis;open-source software PBC implementation;Zynq-7020 SoC;light-weight hardware/software co-design;energy consumption;embedded electronic devices;cryptographic system;pairing based cryptography;simple power analysis;Software;Cryptography;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Clocks;Sensors;Power measurement;ECC;pairing-based cryptography;Montgomery multiplier;hardware-software co-design;system-on-chip;embedded},   doi={10.1109/FPT.2017.8280149},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.},   keywords={brain;cognition;diseases;embedded systems;injuries;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;sport;Web services;traumatic brain injury diagnosis;disability;athlete;head trauma;cognitive abilities;cognitive impairment;inexpensive diagnostic helmet;web-based application system;head injury;patient-tailored treatment plans;web application;Intel Edison IoT IDE;JavaScript;HTML;CSS;Node.js platform;Force;Brain injuries;Head;Sensors;Acceleration;Resistors;Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Intel Edison;Wireless computing;Patient care;Internet of Things;Application;SMS;Traumatic Brain Injury},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249087},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Although wireless networks are utilized in various applications and are providing the backbone for the Internet of Things (IoT), it remains fairly difficult to quickly prototype a visualization. The need for an easily accessible simulator is a necessity, sparked by the alarming growth of sensor networks and the IoT. The development of a reliable and robust large-scale wireless system requires that design concepts are visualized in some digital form, before implementation. Simulations provide a cost effective and feasible method of examining the correctness and scalability of the system before deployment. This work presents a lightweight and interactive topology generator as part of a novel web based network simulator. The simulation framework, to the best of our knowledge, is unlike any other, as it renders and generates graphs in the browser. A simple GUI allows the user to generate isotropic and anisotropic topologies of different shapes, and provides tools that help manipulate complex graphs on client browsers and mobile devices. This tool has its application in several domains including computer network configuration and management, sensor and ad-hoc networks, medical infrastructure, biological and social media visualizations.

IPv6, the new Internet Protocol has made every grain of sand on earth addressable and thus emergence of a new technology called IoT. IoT is simply a machine to machine M2M communication and Sensor nodes are proved to be best suited for this new technology. IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) has attracted lots of attention recently as it can be used for communication of IoT. This paper provides a framework for medical environment, for reducing handoff (HO) latency and signaling overhead while the patient is on the move inside the hospital premises and further it can be applied to other domains also where can be applicable. Sensor nodes can be used for collecting the particular parameters of human body which constitutes wireless body area network (WBAN).

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={256-260},   abstract={In recent years, image processing had covered a wide area over medical applications in diagnosis of wide variety of diseases in medical images. Brain tumor detection is one of the most widely used applications by vast researchers. In this paper a novel approach is presented for detection of affected mass (tumor) in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two level wavelet transform is used to decompose the brain image with mother wavelet `db6'. The horizontal, vertical and the diagonal components at both the levels are further decomposed to level five using histogram for each of the component using one dimensional wavelet transform. By finding global minima at level five, and then mapped at the component histogram, a threshold value is found out. The component then is thresholded using this adaptive threshold. The original image is then reconstructed with the obtained components using this course segmentation. The approximation component at level one is unaltered. Lastly a windowing technique is used to eliminate the false detection due to light in-homogeneity or due to hard tissues, which uses a window based threshold. Results after fine segmentation showed that normal patient images showed complete black region in the final segmented image whereas malignant images showed the region of interest after segmentation. The MRI images from a research institute were obtained and the results after segmentation were validated from an expert from the same research institute.},   keywords={approximation theory;biomedical MRI;diseases;image reconstruction;image resolution;image segmentation;medical image processing;tumours;wavelet transforms;brain tumor pixel detection;adaptive wavelet based histogram thresholding;fine windowing;image processing;medical applications;medical images;affected mass detection;magnetic resonance images;two-level wavelet transform;mother wavelet;diagonal components;vertical components;horizontal components;one-dimensional wavelet transform;course segmentation;hard tissues;black region;malignant images;MRI images;Image segmentation;Histograms;Tumors;Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Wavelet transforms;Magnetic resonance images;wavelet transform;global minima;adaptive threshold;course segmentation;windowing technique;fine segmentation},   doi={10.1109/INCITE.2016.7857627},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Also a critical issue of using D2D assisted cellular networks under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical equipments. In consideration of CTI and EMI, we study the problem of optimizing individual channel rates of the mobile users in different priorities (different levels of emergency) within the Internet of Vehicles for mobile health, and propose an algorithm of controlling the transmit power to solve the above-mentioned problem under a game-theoretical framework.

  year={2017},   volume={1},   number={2},   pages={106-112},   abstract={With mobility as the dominant theme in the emerging fabric of IoE (Internet of Everything), a prolific demand for capacity is a natural consequence. Throughput, latency reduction, availability and reliability are elemental attributes of experientially attractive and robust mobile multimedia services. These elemental attributes drive the demand for spectrum. The use of E-UTRA (Enhanced-Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) technologies, specified under the LTE project, over the 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum, is being considered as a forward-looking approach for standardization to meet the growing capacity demands to support mobile multimedia services. The 5 GHz spectrum band also includes the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, which is utilized by the IEEE 802 family of technologies. LAA (license assisted access) refers to the use of LTE technologies over unlicensed spectrum, with assistance using a licensed radio frequency carrier. A significant challenge in the standardization of LAA for interoperability is the management of co-channel and adjacent channel interference, when both E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies share the same unlicensed spectrum. These challenges are compounded by the differences in the regulations across the three different global ITU (International Telecommunication Union) regions (Europe, Americas, and Asia.) This article will identify strategies and corresponding trade-offs to mitigate the coexistence challenges between the E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies, utilizing forward-looking and interoperable enablers.

From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature.

In addition to algorithm-based auto-grading, the captured mobile multimedia payload is stored in a decentralized repository, which can be shared with a medical practitioner for replay and further manual analysis purposes. Since the framework is language-independent and based on Blockchain and a decentralized big data repository, dyslexic patterns and a massive amount of captured multimedia IoT test data can be shared for further clinical research, statistical analysis, and quality assurance. Notwithstanding, our proposed Blockchain and off-chain based decentralized and secure dyslexia data storage, management and sharing framework will allow security, anonymity, and multimodal visualization of the captured test data for mobile users.

Valid concerns about security, safety and privacy do not appear to be hampering this rapid growth of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). There have been many popular and technical publications by those in software engineering, cyber security and systems safety describing issues and proposing various “fixes.” In simple terms, they address the “why” and the “what” of IoT security, safety and privacy, but not the “how.” There are many cultural and economic reasons why security and privacy concerns are relegated to lower priorities. Also, when many systems are interconnected, the overall security, safety and privacy of the resulting systems of systems generally have not been fully considered and addressed. In order to arrive at an effective enforcement regime, we will examine the costs of implementing suitable security, safety and privacy and the economic consequences of failing to do so. We evaluated current business, professional and government structures and practices for achieving better IoT security, safety and privacy, and found them lacking. Consequently, we proposed a structure for ensuring that appropriate security, safety and privacy are built into systems from the outset. Within such a structure, enforcement can be achieved by incentives on one hand and penalties on the other. Determining the structures and rules necessary to optimize the mix of penalties and incentives is a major goal of this paper.},   keywords={data privacy;Internet of Things;security of data;Internet of Things;IoT security;IoT safety;IoT privacy;software engineering;cyber security;Security;Safety;Privacy;Standards;Software;Government;Internet of Things (IoT);security;safety;privacy;value hills;time to value;system development lifecycle (SDLC);vulnerability marketplace;software liability},   doi={10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160214},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2017},   volume={21},   number={5},   pages={1327-1337},   abstract={The computer-aided diagnosis for histopathological images has attracted considerable attention. Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.},   keywords={image classification;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;principal component analysis;histopathological image classification;color pattern random binary hashing-based PCaNet;matrix-form classifier;computer-aided diagnosis;principal component analysis network;deep learning algorithm;feature learning;color norm pattern;angular pattern;color channels;multiple binary images;C-RBH-PCANet algorithm;Image color analysis;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Histograms;Algorithm design and analysis;Image classification;Color angular pattern;color histopathological image;color norm pattern;matrix-form classifier;PCANet;random binary hashing;Algorithms;Breast Neoplasms;Databases, Factual;Female;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Kidney Diseases;Machine Learning;Principal Component Analysis;ROC Curve},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2016.2602823},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={31630-31643},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) comprises of large number of smart devices that can exchange sensed data by availing online services. Smart devices can directly interact with the human beings for sensing the healthcare parameters and transmitting to a central repository. During the data exchange, it is mandatory to secure the messages between sender and receiver to handle the malicious human based attacks. For providing secure communication, a number of signature-based schemes are explored in literature but smart devices need more lightweight operations by ensuring desired security strengths. The main problem during signature based approaches is the computational overhead due to large real numbers required for signature and verification processes. This paper presents a light weight shortened complex digital signature algorithm for providing secure communication between smart devices in human centered IoT. We have used less extensive operations to achieve signature and verification processes like human beings do signatures on legal documents and verify later as per witness. We have also presented a multi-option parameter selection to use a signature-verification pair of expressions at particular index by adopting the common practice of human beings for using different signatures as per document criticality level. It enhances the security strength to guard against traffic analysis attacks. We have developed an experimental setup where a number of cell phones and smart devices are considered for secure communication using existing and proposed digital signature schemes. Results demonstrate the supremacy of our scheme as compared to preliminaries.},   keywords={computer network security;digital signatures;Internet;Internet of Things;telecommunication traffic;lightweight digital signature;security scheme;smart devices;data exchange;malicious human based attacks;secure communication;signature-based schemes;verification processes;complex digital signature algorithm;human-centered Internet of Things;IoT;healthcare parameters;central repository;multioption parameter selection;traffic analysis attacks;cell phones;Digital signatures;Smart devices;Internet of Things;Receivers;Public key;Medical services;Confidentiality;Complex numbers;Digital signatures;Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844406},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In particular, smart healthcare applications in IoTs have been receiving increasing attention for industrial and academic research. However, due to the sensitiveness of medical information, security and privacy issues in IoTs healthcare systems are very important. Designing an efficient secure scheme with less computation time and energy consumption is a critical challenge in IoTs healthcare systems. In this paper, a lightweight online/offline certificateless signature (L-OOCLS) is proposed, then a heterogeneous remote anonymous authentication protocol (HRAAP) is designed to enable remote WBANs users to anonymously enjoy healthcare service based on the Internet of Things applications. The proposed L-OOCLS scheme is proven secure in random oracle model and the proposed HRAAP can resist various types of attacks. Compared with the existing relevant schemes, the proposed HRAAP achieves less computation overhead as well as less power consumption on WBANs client.

Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Smart grid (SG) is one of the most advanced technologies, which plays a key role in maintaining a balance between demand and supply by implementing demand response (DR) program. In SG, the main focus of the researchers is on home energy management (HEM) system, which is called demand side management (DSM). Appliance scheduling is an integral part of HEM system as it manages energy demand according to supply, by automatically controlling the appliances and shifting the load from peak to off peak hours. In this paper, the comparative performance of HEM controller embedded with heuristic algorithms; harmony search algorithm (HSA), enhanced differential evolution (EDE) and harmony search differential evolution (HSDE) is evaluated. The integration of renewable energy source (RES) in SG makes the performance of HEM system more efficient. The electricity consumption in peak hours usually creates peaks and increases the cost but integration of RES makes the electricity consumer able to use the appliances in the peak hours.We formulate our problem using multiple knapsack theory that the maximum capacity of the consumer of electricity must be in the range which is bearable for consumer with respect to electricity bill. Feasible regions are defined to validate the formulated problem. Finally, simulation of the proposed techniques is conducted in MATLAB to validate the performance of proposed scheduling algorithms in terms of cost, peak to average ratio and waiting time minimization.},   keywords={Home appliances;Heuristic algorithms;Energy consumption;Peak to average power ratio;Pricing;Optimization;Energy management;Smart grid;knapsack;enhanced differential evolution;harmony search algorithm;home energy management system;demand side management},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2763624},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

It is an active research area and has evolved tremendously in recent decades. The learning activities are commonly explored using patient cases. Among multiple medical education methodologies, Case-Based Learning (CBL) is considered as an effective methodology for small-group of medical students. Normally in CBL, the medical experts give the legacy fixed medical cases to students during their class for group discussions and their learning. In this practice, due to lack of beforehand practice or knowledge about that particular case, students hesitate to participate due to lack of confidence. Internet of Things (IoTs) is one of the well-known emerging technology and this hesitation can be dealt with creating real-world clinical cases using IoTs data and user-friendly environment for case-based learning. In this paper, an IoT-based CBL methodology is introduced, which records realworld patient data using IoTs, analyzes the imperative signs' data, creates the real-world clinical case for students practicing, and finally provides feedback to medical students.

One of its promising branches, the medical IoT, will also be accompanied by heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures. However, the efficacy of a medical IoT application will depend on how well the surrounding smart devices collaborate with it to serve the individual needs of the users. Pre-programmed solutions lack flexibility to adapt to each need and environment, and fail to make full use of the capabilities of a set of smart devices. In this paper, we propose a concept based on the flexible and user-friendly synthesis and switching of services for medical IoT applications. The crux of the concept is to provide a methodology in which non-experts can dynamically define services based on their needs. We describe a potential scenario, discuss the associated challenges, and present preliminary results on the feasibility of this approach. Particularly, we focus on design aspects for realizing the concept and propose the use of interpreters on the smart devices as alternative solution.

With the promise of Internet of Things (IoT) and advent of wearable-captured PCG signal, automated analysis of PCG signal plays vital role in remote and mobile cardiac health management. One of the challenging problems of completely automated analytics or clinical prediction method is the frequent presence of corruption in PCG signals from multiple noise sources like motion artifacts, ambient noise and majority of the automated computational methods fail to ensure sufficient clinical utility due to their inability to eliminate the corruption in PCG signals. In this paper, we propose a personal cardiac management application and ecosystem that helps patient's on-demand cardiac health assessment. It applies novel noise filtering method on PCG signals through robust feature space optimization feature selection with audio signal processing primitives to ensure effective clinical analytics and identifies cardiac abnormality condition. The proposed scheme is a precise blend of signal processing, information theoretic and machine learning techniques. We depict more than 85% accuracy and high specificity of identifying noisy PCG signals while experimenting over annotated PCG datasets from large publicly available MIT-Physionet database.

To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce embedded multiple flows (EMF) communication method, which (i) embeds different pieces of information in existing traffic and (ii)concurrently sends out these information from one IoT sender to multiple IoT receivers that have a different communication technology from the sender. By doing this, our EMF method (i) enables cross-technology communication among heterogeneous IoT devices, (ii) does not introduce any extra control traffic, and (iii) is transparent to the higher layer applications.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={In this work, the advantages of coupling biomedical signal compressors with clinical feature-based distortion measures are demonstrated. Such a coupling allow biomedical signal compressors to self-establish hard limits with regards to choices surrounding compression ratios, or `quality settings', a compressor can safely choose from to guarantee that features of clinical significance are protected so that their reconstruction remains clinically relevant. This coupling allows biomedical signal compressors to operate in an unsupervised manner, since it is demonstrated that establishing hard limits that are applied equally to all signals does not allow one to maximize and/or strike a balance between compression ratio and signal fidelity. Such mechanisms can be employed in communication architectures in wearable body area sensor networks (BASNs) for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications for autonomous tasks. While feature-based distortion measures such as the Clinical Distortion Index (CDI), and the Weighted Distortion Measure (WDD) already exist, we demonstrate the viability of our work by proposing a generalizable feature-based distortion measure we call the Diagnostic Distortion Measure (DDM), which offers several benefits that address a few shortcomings present in the CDI and WDD in real-time applications for unsupervised self-guided compressors.

In addition, self-synchronous switching is achieved by applying electrodes to the track of the rolling ball. A new passive prebiasing mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the pulse generator. Both simulation and experimental results were conducted to demonstrate the improvement. Experimental results show that 76% more energy can be extracted by the prebias mechanism compared to the unbiased case.

Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code.

  year={2018},   volume={14},   number={5},   pages={2210-2219},   abstract={Telemonitoring of diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) signal in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise to be an evolving direction in personalized medicine. The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care, especially for the respiratory diseases. However, while designing such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency, etc., to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different from the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps toward these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi.

The EMS requires cooperative workflows between patients or caregivers, paramedics and medical centers in the community. In a conventional EMS, they have difficulties in obtaining causes of emergencies and personal medical histories, which are important for a rapid and proper response. We analyzed the requirement of a smart EMS (SEMS) system and derived the key components in connected care environments leveraging information and communication technology. A survey of paramedics (n=113) revealed that a SEMS system using IoT technology should integrate personal lifelogs, electronic medical records, and patient monitoring in ambulances into pre-hospital care recording systems. It also addressed context-awareness in the EMS accelerates first responder's activities, while supporting personalized care not only at the scene of the emergency but also during the entire hospital stay. Based on requirement analysis, we designed and implemented SEMS using health information standards to provide interoperability between devices and systems.

In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes.

In business, industries, institutions and organizations, individuals contribute the data volume like technical reports, seminar reports, research papers, dissertations, thesis etc. For instance, 30 billion web pages are accessed or the World Wide Web. With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms.

Security attacks may disrupt the working of insulin pump system by delivering the lethal dose to patients and endanger their lives.

Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the thresh hold value of insulin based on last three months log of insulin pump system. If the amount of insulin to be injected by the insulin pump system is greater than our predicted thresh hold amount, then our system asks the patient to perform the gesture.

Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient's real-time data at fog layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT-based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days.

Real time monitoring for analyzing vital signs to early detect or predict life threatening adverse events and frequent checks if the prescribed medicine is taken in time or not is required. In the existing system there is a need of another person for monitoring the patient condition. The proposed system eliminates the need of such manual observation of the patient. This system mainly consists of three components iMed box, iMed pack, Bio_patch which plays an important role. The iMed box is the central platform of the ihome health-IOT system to which iMedpack and the Bio-patch are connected. This box sends the information regarding patient to the doctor through internet and reminds the patient to take the tablets at the prescribed timings. The Bio patch is used for continuous monitoring and then sends that information to the iMed box. With the help of the GPS doctor/family members can locate the patients position. GSM is used to send and receive the information from the Doctor. Implementaton of this system will monitor the patient condition regularly and thus reduces sudden deaths.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cellular radio;diseases;Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;microprocessor chips;patient monitoring;real-time systems;health monitoring system;ARM7;global ageing;chronic diseases;patient physical status;medication monitoring;real time monitoring;vital signs;patient condition monitoring;iMed box;iMed pack;ihome health-IOT system;Bio-patch;Internet of Things;GPS;GSM;Medical services;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;ZigBee;Biosensors;Temperature sensors;ARM 7;GSM;GPS;Sensors;Zigbee;RFID Communication},   doi={10.1109/CESYS.2016.7889825},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

AAL systems are able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sensors. In this paper, we propose an AAL architecture for the monitoring of elderly people, able to guarantee the collection of heterogeneous sensor data as well as the detection of critical events such as the older adult fall. A remote reasoning system processes this data with the aim of generating appropriate events.

However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources.

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;Parkinson's disease management;wearable technologies;Internet-of-Things;IoT;diagnostics;self-assessment;objective device-assessment;patient experience;disease progression;physical deficits;intelligent algorithms;tablets;cell phones;medical database;lightweight wearable sensors;real-time motion metrics;laterally distributed platform;chronic neurological disorders;life expectancy;global healthcare system;Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors;Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies;Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

We proposed a complete cognitive control process which contains three stages: (sensory stage: 110~140ms, identification stage: 260~320ms, execution stage: 500~700ms). Based on this cognitive process, each EEG sample is divided into three parts. Average amplitude in time domain and LZC (LempelZiv Complexity) was computed for the divided part of each EEG sample and used to extract features from the EEG signal. Optimized SVM was used to recognize the EEG sample.

Miniaturization is a new key requirement for the application in the internet of things and implantable medical devices. Realization of efficient RF power transfer using conventional techniques based on 900 MHz and 2.4GHz is difficult, mainly due to the relatively large wavelength in these bands. On the other hand, conventional inductive coupling is very inefficient as the device becomes very small, limited by the small coupling factor and operating frequency. In this paper, we utilize a multicoil transmitting (Tx) array to power up very small receiving (Rx) devices in the near field by boosting the power gain to a much higher level. The power gain boosting is achieved by operating the array close to its self-resonance frequency and optimizing the phase relationship of the array elements. To validate the proposed technique, we implemented a prototype printed circuit board (PCB) to power a 1 cm × 1 cm small Rx coil at a distance of 20 cm. To demonstrate the improvement on power gain, we designed a 3 × 3 Tx coil array composed of nine 3 cm × 3 cm elements, as well as an individual large Tx coil with the same dimension of the array for fair comparison. Measured results show that the transducer power gain can be increased by 16.4 dB with the proposed technique.},   keywords={inductive power transmission;transducers;gain boosting array technique;weakly-coupled wireless power transfer;near-field inductive coupling;Internet of Things application;implantable medical device;RF power transfer;multicoil transmitting array;very small receiving device;printed circuit board prototype;transducer;frequency 900 MHz;frequency 2.4 GHz;Couplings;Mathematical model;Gain;Transducers;Impedance;Boosting;Phased arrays;Miniaturization;multicoil array;near-field;power gain;weakly-coupled;wireless power transfer (WPT)},   doi={10.1109/TPEL.2016.2626473},   ISSN={0885-8993},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={Recent advances in embedded and IoT (internet-of-things) technologies are rapidly transforming health-care solutions and we are headed to a future of smaller, smarter, wearable and connected medical devices. IoT and advanced health sensors provide more convenience to patients and physicians. Where physicians can now wirelessly and automatically monitor patient's state. While these medical embedded devices provide a lot of new opportunities to improve the health care system, they also introduce a new set of security risks since they are connected to networks. More importantly, these devices are extremely hardware- and power-constrained, which in turn makes securing these devices more complex. Implementing complex malware detectors or anti-virus on these devices is either very costly or infeasible due to these limitations on power and resources. In this paper, we propose a new framework called SYNDROME for “externally” monitoring medical embedded devices. Our malware detector uses electromagnetic (EM) signals involuntary generated by the device as it executes a (medical) application in the absence of malware, and analyzes them to build a reference model. It then monitors the EM signals generated by the device during execution and reports an error if there is a statistically significant deviation from the reference model. To evaluate Syndrome, we use open-source software to implement a real-world medical device, called a Syringe Pump, on a variety of well-known embedded/IoT devices including Arduino Uno, FPGA Nios II soft-core, and two Linux IoT mini-computers: OlimexA13 and TS-7250. We also implement a control-flow hijack attack on SyringePump and use Syndrome to detect and stop the attack.

However, as a heterogeneous network system, the interconnection of different CMIoT components is the primary problem, which needs to be solved. Traditional protocol conversion gateway in the Internet of Things only implements the packet format conversion. When the network environment changes, it is difficult to effectively implement the data path. We propose a CMIoT architecture with the assist of the communication auxiliary gateway, and design the simplified protocol message format under the premise of satisfying the functional requirements. At the same time, the CMIoT architecture model is built based on the Ptolemy II modeling environment and implemented in a community, and it is proved that the interconnection between the IPv6 network and the physical network can be realized more effectively.},   keywords={Internet of Things;internetworking;IP networks;medical computing;protocols;transport protocols;core technology IPv;medical field;heterogeneous network system;communication auxiliary gateway;simplified protocol message;CMIoT architecture model;IPv6 network;Community Medical Internet of Things;CMIoT components;protocol conversion gateway;Sensors;Logic gates;Servers;Protocols;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;component architectures;modeling;simulation;IP networks},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2801563},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={79-90},   abstract={Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internetof-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. These algorithms, however, need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as addition/ removal of a sensor to/ from the network or displacement/ misplacement/ mis-orientation of the physical sensors on the body. We challenge this retraining model by stimulating the vision of autonomous learning with the goal of eliminating the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly expensive process of collecting labeled training data in dynamic environments. We propose an approach for autonomous retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any new labeled training data. We focus on a dynamic setting where new sensors are added to the system and worn on various body locations. We capture the inherent correlation between observations made by a static sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new dynamic sensor views for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our realtime dynamic-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an average accuracy of 81.1% in activity recognition using three experimental datasets. This amount of accuracy represents more than 13.8% improvement in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the sensor data in the newly added sensor. This performance is only 11.2% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.},   keywords={computer based training;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);wearable computers;synchronous dynamic view learning;autonomous training;activity recognition models;wearable sensors;wearable technologies;human-centered Internet-of-Things applications;machine learning algorithms;physical sensors;autonomous learning;realtime dynamic-view autonomous learning approach;Heuristic algorithms;Activity recognition;Wearable sensors;Machine learning algorithms;Training data;Signal processing algorithms;Training;Wearable Sensors;Machine Learning;Signal Processing;IoT},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The first approach utilizes phase locked loop (PLL) to multiply the frequency of a very accurate Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS), generating a FMCW signal. The second approach multiplies the generated DDS signal using a frequency multiplier (F12). Counter-intuitive existence of low power harmonics (F13, F14, F11, F10, etc.) in the frequency multiplier added improvements in our tests. Tiny variations in environment are easily observed on specific bars in FFT of down-converted signals in the frequency multiplier approach. Both approaches work by sending a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) that reflects off objects present in the room. Based on the reflected signal, we calculate distances and movements, from which we then extract breathing and heart rates. In both approaches, we try two sets of microwave signals: Triangular FMCW and Sawtooth FMCW. Both approaches showed more obvious variation for body movement. In the case of the Triangular FMCW signal, interpreting data is more challenging. On the other hand, the Sawtooth FMCW signal resulted in clear output but lower power and harder to directly observe.},   keywords={direct digital synthesis;fast Fourier transforms;frequency modulation;medical signal detection;microwave measurement;patient monitoring;phase locked loops;pneumodynamics;down-converted signals;frequency multiplier approach;Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave;reflected signal;microwave signals;body movement;Triangular FMCW signal;Sawtooth FMCW signal;remote monitoring;vital signs;m-health application;phase locked loop;generated DDS signal;counter-intuitive existence;low power harmonics;Direct Digital Synthesizer;breathing;heart rates;Phase locked loops;Bandwidth;Biomedical monitoring;Time-frequency analysis;Radar;Heart rate;Vital sign monitoring;m-health;signal processing},   doi={10.1109/FiCloudW.2017.105},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity.

In IoT everything collaborates to deliver services and applications to users, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) being one of these applications. Some AAL smart homes uses infrared sensors to recognize some activities of daily living and to track people along the environment. Location tracking is vital in Ambient Assisted living and can be a useful information to improve AAL systems. A common problem in such systems is that each tracking model is based on a specific sensor's placing architecture. In order to assure that the system will work properly, the model has to be fitted by an expert. Modeling is usually costly and it relies on a specific architecture. In our previous work, the tracking model needed to be fitted manually. In order to introduce adaptability, this work proposes an approach to automatically fit the model avoiding the need of an expert to fit a different model for each kind of sensor's placing architecture.

Meanwhile, the performance and accuracy of these applications highly depend on the characteristics of communication over advertisement channels. Unfortunately, the existing literature does not offer an extensive characterization of these channels under various operational conditions. In this paper, we address this research gap through conducting extensive experiments in four different environments. We study the effect of environment and interference on noise floor and signal propagation, and we present a model for noise floor and extract the parameters of log-normal path loss model.

In this vision e-health applications are one of the most promising applications in IoT. However, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality constitutes the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight authentication scheme for an e-health application. This scheme allows both of sensors and the Base Station (BS) to authenticate each other in order to secure the collection of health-related data. Our scheme uses nonces and Keyed-Hash message authentication (HMAC) to check the integrity of authentication exchanges. In addition, it provides authentication with less energy consumption, and it terminates with a session key agreement between each sensor and the Base Station. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that our scheme saves energy.

We present an instance of a cloud-based web server which relies on a “home system” for the collection of information from an heterogeneous set of devices, providing a high level description of the proposed overall architectural model, of the induced opportunities from the market perspective, and of how it could be used by healthcare applications developers and service providers, including details on how the web server Application Programming Interfaces (API) is implemented in our instance.},   keywords={application program interfaces;cloud computing;cost reduction;file servers;health care;home automation;Internet of Things;operating systems (computers);physiology;Web services;IoT-inspired cloud-based Web service architecture;e-Health applications;Internet of Things;cost reduction;user-friendliness;health monitoring devices;environmental sensors;physiological parameter monitoring devices;home automation devices;operating system;service providers;cloud infrastructure;user data collection;user data storage;healthcare service provisioning applications;cloud-based Web server;home system;market perspective;Web server application programming interfaces;Web server API;Medical services;Web services;Internet of things;Monitoring;Sensors;Business;Portals;e-Health;Internet of Things (IoT);Web of Things (WoT);REST;web services;cloud platforms;s-Health},   doi={10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580759},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={6530-6539},   abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. Its process control is often referred to as embedded systems. Generally, CPS and Internet of Things have the same basic architecture, whereas the former shows a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements, i.e., wireless sensor networks can be a vital part of CPS applications. With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},   keywords={alarm systems;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;health care;medical computing;wireless sensor networks;medical cyber physical systems;process control;embedded systems;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;CPS applications;medical sensors;healthcare organization;Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter;healthcare environments;fuzzy logic;MFAFilter;fuzzy if-then rules;cyber-physical systems;false alarm reduction;Sensors;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks;Fuzzy logic;Industries;Computer science;Intrusion detection;False alarm reduction;fuzzy if-then rules;alarm filter;medical cyber-physical systems;wireless sensor networks;machine learning technique},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794685},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In this paper, we consider a three-tier hierarchical m-Health system: 1) the sensor network tier capturing vital signals; 2) the mobile computing network tier processing and routing the sensed data to a fixed remote location; and 3) the back-end network tier processing and analyzing the sensed medical data along with patient's medical history. Based on this architecture, a physical layer security scheme for the second tier is developed and network performance of the introduced scheme is analyzed under different metrics using stochastic geometry. To be specific, secure transmission range and average end-to-end delay are analyzed for two different strategies: the mobile device transmits: 1) to the nearest neighbor and 2) to the furthest neighbor. Furthermore, we consider the cases of full knowledge on eavesdroppers' locations and when such information is unavailable. Results show that transmitting to the nearest neighbor achieves the highest secure transmission distance with the lowest mean delay when full information on eavesdroppers is available.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;stochastic processes;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;sensor network tier;mobile computing network tier processing;fixed remote location;back-end network tier processing;sensed medical data;physical layer security scheme;mobile Health cyber-physical systems;biomedical sensors;m-Health server;three-tier hierarchical m-Health system;end-to-end delay;mobile device;stochastic geometry;Mobile handsets;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Wireless communication;Physical layer;Network security;Eavesdropping;end-to-end delay;mobile health (m-Health);physical layer security;secure transmission;stochastic geometry},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780263},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

They are used to support a variety of personalized, advanced, and integrated applications in the field of medical, fitness, sports, military, and consumer electronics. In a WBAN, network longevity is a major challenge due to the limitation of the availability of energy supply in body nodes. Therefore, routing protocols can play a key role towards making such networks energy efficient. In this work, we exhibit that a routing protocol together with an effective body node coordinator (BNC) deployment strategy can influence the network lifetime eminently. Our initial work shows that the variation in the placement of a BNC within a WBAN could significantly vary the overall network lifetime. This motivated us to work on an effective node placement strategy for a BNC, within a WBAN; and thus we propose three different BNC placement algorithms considering different features of available energy efficient routing protocols in a WBAN. Our simulation results show that these algorithms along with an appropriate routing protocol can prolong the network lifetime by up to 47.45%.},   keywords={body area networks;routing protocols;body node coordinator placement algorithms;wireless body area networks;WBAN;intelligent wireless monitoring systems;effective node placement strategy;network lifetime;BNC placement algorithms;energy efficient routing protocols;Routing protocols;Algorithm design and analysis;Wireless sensor networks;Energy efficiency;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Internet of Things;Body Area Network (BAN);Body Node Coordinator (BNC);BNC deployment;energy efficiency;human body;IEEE 802.15.6;Internet of Things (IoT);node deployment;WBAN;Body area network (BAN);body node coordinator (BNC) deployment;energy efficiency;human body;IEEE 802.15.6;Internet of Things (IoT);node deployment;wireless body area network (WBAN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366110},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data.

Firstly, the concept and various applications of IoT are discussed; then the technologies of IoT are compared with its diverse selected characteristics followed by the discussion on communication features of IoT; subsequently technological challenges in IoT are explored which lead to the thought of discussion on recent perspectives in IoT. Among these perspectives, nowadays, IoT needs a service oriented approach to improve the functionality of device and to provide successful application integration using middleware architecture. Finally, the critical disputes that require addressing by research community are investigated and a solution for these issues is taken in hand by using IoT gateway and a proposal has been made to make the data handling in IoT more efficient.},   keywords={Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;IoT gateway;smart gateway solution;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;Radiofrequency identification;Medical services;Monitoring;Agriculture;Mobile communication;Internet of Things (IoT);Service Oriented IoT;Service Oriented Architecture (SOA);Middleware;IoT gateway},   doi={10.1109/I-SMAC.2017.8058352},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={230-237},   abstract={Usefulness of health care services is seriously effected by medication adherence. Medication intake is one of the cases where adherence may be difficult for the patients, who are willing to undertake the prescribed therapy. Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure for activity monitoring is a strong candidate solution to maintain adherence of forgetful patients. In this study, we propose an IoT framework where medication intake is ensured with real time continuous activity recognition. We present our use case with the focus of application and network layers. We utilize an activity classification scheme, which considers inter-activity detection consistency based on non-predefined feature extraction as the application layer. The network layer includes a gateway structure ensuring end-to-end reliability in the connection between a wireless sensor network (WSN) and Internet. Results obtained in simulation environment suggest that the selected application and network layers introduce a feasible solution for the medication intake use case.},   keywords={biomedical communication;computer network reliability;feature extraction;health care;image classification;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical computing;object detection;object recognition;patient treatment;wireless sensor networks;medication intake adherence;real time continuous activity recognition;IoT framework;Internet-of-things;health care services;prescribed therapy;application layers;network layers;activity classification scheme;interactivity detection consistency;non- predefined feature extraction;gateway structure;end-to-end reliability;wireless sensor network;Internet;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Sensors;Smart phones;Logic gates;Wireless sensor networks;medical adherence;medication intake;Internet of Things;activity recognition;gateway},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2015.7347966},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={Views on the role and importance of dew computing in the service and control technology}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={164-168},   abstract={Modern day computing paradigms foster for a huge community of involved participants from almost the entire spectrum of human endeavour. For computing and data processing there are individual Computers, their Clusters, Grids, and, finally, the Clouds. For pure data communication there is the Internet, and for the Human-understandable Information Communication for example the World Wide Web. The rapid development of hand-held mobile devices with high computational capabilities and Internet connectivity enabled certain parts of Clouds to be “lowered” into the so called “thin clients”. This led to development of the Fog-Computing Paradigm as well as development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) concepts. However, the most significant amount of information processing all around us is done on the lowest possible computing level, outright connected to the physical environment and mostly directly controlling our human immediate surroundings. These “invisible” information processing devices we find in our car's motor, in the refrigerator, the gas boiler, air-conditioners, wending machines, musical instruments, radio-receivers, home entertainment systems, traffic-controls, theatres, lights, wood-burning stoves, and ubiquitously all over the industry and in industrial products. These devices, which are neither at the cloud/fog edge, nor even at the mobile edge, but rather at the physical edge of computing are the basis of the Dew Computing Paradigm. The merits of seamlessly integrating those “dew” devices into the Cloud - Fog - Dew Computing hierarchy are enormous, for individuals, the public and industrial sectors, the scientific community and the commercial sector, by bettering the physical and communicational, as well as the intellectual, immediate human environment. In the possibility of developing integrated home management/entertainment/maintenance systems, self-organising traffic-control systems, intelligent driver suggestion systems, coordinated building/car/traffic pollution control systems, real-time hospital systems with all patient and equipment status and control collaborating with the medical staff, fully consistent synaesthetic artistic performances including artists and independent individuals (“active public”) from wide apart, power distribution peek filtering, self-reorganisation and mutual cooperation systems based on informed behaviour of individual power consumption elements, emergency systems which cooperate with the town traffic, etc., etc., the Dew-Computing paradigm shows the way towards the Distributed Information Services Environment (DISE), and finally towards the present civilisation's aim of establishment of a Global Information Processing Environment (GIPE). It is therefore essential, through Research, Innovation and Development, to explore the realm of possibilities of Dew Computing, solve the basic problems of integration of the “dew” level with the higher level Dew-Fog-Cloud hierarchy, with special attention to the necessity of information (not only data) processing and communication, and demonstrate the viability and high effectiveness of the developed architecture in several areas of human endeavour through real life implementations. The present scientific and technological main objective is to provide the concepts, methods and proof-of-concept implementations that are moving Dew Computing from a theoretical/experimental concept to a validated technology. Finally, it will be necessary to define and standardise the basics of the Dew Computing Architecture, Language and Ontology, which is a necessity for the seamless integration of the emerging new Global Information Processing Architecture into the Fog and Cloud Paradigms, as a way towards the above mentioned civilisation goals.},   keywords={cloud computing;network computers;dew computing;modern day computing paradigms;human endeavour;pure data communication;human-understandable information communication;World Wide Web;hand-held mobile devices;computational capabilities;Internet connectivity;thin clients;fog-computing paradigm;Internet of things;IoT;Internet of everything;IoE;cloud-fog edge;integrated home management-entertainment-maintenance systems;self-organising traffic-control systems;intelligent driver suggestion systems;coordinated building-car-traffic pollution control systems;real-time hospital systems;synaesthetic artistic performances;power distribution peek filtering;self-reorganisation;mutual cooperation systems;power consumption elements;distributed information services environment;DISE;global information processing environment;GIPE;dew-fog-cloud hierarchy;civilisation goals;Cloud computing;Internet of things;Computer architecture;Information processing;Supercomputers},   doi={10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522131},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers. In addition, the system can represent the collected data in useful ways, perform automatic decision making and provide many advanced services such as real-time notifications for immediate attention.},   keywords={diseases;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;low-cost fog-assisted health-care IoT system;Internet of Things;energy-efficient sensor nodes;heart diseases;coronary artery disease;heart muscle disease;cardiomyopathy;heart attack;heart rate irregularity;heart condition monitoring;ECG;electrocardiography;real-time monitoring;real-time analysis;low-cost health monitoring system;continuous remote monitoring;wireless transmission;respiration rate;body temperature;smart gateway;automatic decision making;real-time notifications;Monitoring;Logic gates;Electrocardiography;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Internet-of-Things;low-cost;wearable;fog computing;health monitoring;energy-efficient;low energy},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986551},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2548-2556},   abstract={Social Internet of Things is assumed to provide health services by incorporating social networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although, much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the multisensor therapy (m-Therapy) framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.},   keywords={Big Data;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient treatment;social networking (online);medical institutions;ambient IoT sensors;ambient environmental data;m-Therapy monitoring system;multisensor framework;social networks;medical solutions;home use;multisensor therapy;ambient data;therapy exercises;in-home therapy management;social therapy of things perspective;social Internet of things;gesture-tracking sensors;m-therapy framework;Medical treatment;Sensors;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Servers;Gesture recognition sensors;range of motion;smart living;Social Internet of Things (SIoT)-based mobile therapy;therapy},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2776150},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

Over the last decade, as an important part of the Internet of Things, we have witnessed WBANs playing an increasing role in modern medical systems because of its capabilities to collect real-time biomedical data through intelligent medical sensors in or around the patients' body and send the collected data to remote medical personnel for clinical diagnostics. WBANs not only bring us conveniences but also bring along the challenge of keeping data's confidentiality and preserving patients' privacy. In the past few years, several anonymous authentication (AA) schemes for WBANs were proposed to enhance security by protecting patients' identities and by encrypting medical data. However, many of these schemes are not secure enough. First, we review the most recent AA scheme for WBANs and point out that it is not secure for medical applications by proposing an impersonation attack. After that, we propose a new AA scheme for WBANs and prove that it is provably secure. Our detailed analysis results demonstrate that our proposed AA scheme not only overcomes the security weaknesses in previous schemes but also has the same computation costs at a client side.},   keywords={authorisation;biomedical communication;body area networks;cryptography;data privacy;embedded systems;medical computing;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;wireless body area network;provable security;wireless communications;embedded systems;integrated circuit technologies;WBAN;modern medical systems;real-time biomedical data;intelligent medical sensors;remote medical personnel;anonymous authentication schemes;networking paradigm;patients body;Internet of Things;clinical diagnostics;data confidentiality;patients privacy;patient identity protection;medical data encryption;impersonation attack;Authentication;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Elliptic curve cryptography;Medical diagnostic imaging;Attack;authentication;security;wireless body area network (WBAN)},   doi={10.1109/JSYST.2016.2544805},   ISSN={1932-8184},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1333-1338},   abstract={The application of IPv6 to the community medical Internet of things (CMIoT) is helpful to solve the heterogeneous network fusion problem. However, how to effectively implement the application of IPv6 technology in the CMIoT is still a problem that needs to be constantly explored. While the IPv6 technology can effectively solve the problem of identifying the nodes of the CMIoT, the big data in the CMIoT becomes a more prominent problem. On the basis of the research on the application of IPv6 technology to the Internet of things (IoT), this paper proposes a kind of IPv6 proxy scheme for the interconnection between the IoT subnet and the IPv6 Internet. At the same time, the big data problem of the IoT is discussed, and a big data processing architecture based on cloud platform is designed for effective processing of the big data of the CMIoT. Combined with the Ptolemy II modeling and simulation platform, the IPv6 proxy scheme and the medical big data processing architecture based on cloud platform are modeled and simulated. The simulation and analysis results show that the IPv6 proxy scheme can not only achieve more efficient implementation of IoT subnet nodes accessing the IPv6 Internet based on the IPv6 technology, but also play a certain role in the big data processing of CMIoT.},   keywords={Big Data;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;Unicast;Medical diagnostic imaging;IPv6 proxy;Internet of things;Big data;Data mining;Smart health},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450268},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

 title={Fidelity-preserving coefficient truncation method for wavelet-based compressors for biomedical IoT applications}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={A common approach in the realization of wavelet-based compressors for ECG signals makes use of truncation methods, whereby wavelet coefficients are truncated (i.e., thrown away) if they're deemed insignificant. A popular truncation strategy applied in these compressors is to truncate based on Energy Packing Efficiency or EPE, which tends to favor coefficients at higher scales because their energy contribution (either in squared or absolute-value sense) is itself insignificant. In this paper, we present four rudimentary truncation strategies to analyze and demonstrate how the choice of truncation strategy can affect the signal in terms of compression ratio (CR) and signal fidelity. Of these, a truncation strategy we call `ScaleRelativeMAX' is proposed, which exhibits some useful properties for sensitive biomedical applications. Simulation results are presented using representative select ECG records from PhysioNet's database to show that some truncation methods - in particular, our proposed truncation strategy - allows for fine-grained fidelity and CR control than others and offer nearly linear reconstruction error growth as a function of the truncation threshold in comparison to other strategies that are more aggressive in favoring CR over signal fidelity. Such fidelity-first strategies are useful in biomedical communication architectures for emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that employ compressors to minimize energy transmission costs in Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) and similar wearable devices. Such signals carry diagnostic information that are of clinical significance, and whose reconstruction of clinical features should take priority and is in stark contrast to ordinary multimedia class signals, which generally tend to favor CR over signal fidelity.},   keywords={biomedical communication;body sensor networks;data compression;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;signal reconstruction;wavelet transforms;signal fidelity;sensitive biomedical applications;truncation methods;fine-grained fidelity;truncation threshold;compressors;fidelity-preserving coefficient truncation method;biomedical IoT applications;ECG signals;wavelet coefficients;popular truncation strategy;rudimentary truncation strategies;wavelet-based compressors;energy packing efficiency;ScaleRelativeMAX;PhysioNet's database;body area sensor networks;Discrete wavelet transforms;Compressors;Electrocardiography;Computer architecture;Partitioning algorithms;Fidelity-Preserving;Wavelet;Truncation;Strategies;IoT;Biomedical;Compressors;Energy-Packing Efficiency;Communication;Architectures;Body Area Sensor Networks;BASN;Wearables;ECG;PhysioNet},   doi={10.1109/ICSPCS.2017.8270509},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1-13},   abstract={This paper presents an advanced Internet of Things point-of-care bio-fluid analyzer; a LoRa/Bluetooth-enabled electronic reader for biomedical strip-based diagnostics system for personalized monitoring. We undertake test simulations (technology trial without patient subjects) to demonstrate potential of long-range analysis, using a disposable test `key' and companion Android app to form a diagnostic platform suitable for remote point-of-care screening for urinary tract infection (UTI). The 868 MHz LoRaWAN-enabled personalized monitor demonstrated sound potential with UTI test results being correctly diagnosed and transmitted to a remote secure cloud server in every case. Tests ranged over distances of 1.1-6.0 Km with radio path losses from 119-141 dB. All tests conducted were correctly and robustly received at the base station and relayed to the secure server for inspection. The UTI test strips were visually inspected for correct diagnosis based on color change and verified as 100% accurate. Results from testing across a number of regions indicate that such an Internet of Things medical solution is a robust and simple way to deliver next generation community-based smart diagnostics and disease management to best benefit patients and clinical staff alike. This significant step can be applied to any type of home or region, particularly those lacking suitable mobile signals, broadband connections, or even landlines. It brings subscription-free long-range biotelemetry to healthcare providers and offers savings on regular clinician home visits or frequent clinic visits by the chronically ill.

In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases. Overall, this study can usefully promote the development of healthcare-strategy design and implementation.},   keywords={diseases;electronic health records;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;patient care;pattern clustering;high-cost cluster;healthcare-strategy design;cluster analysis;flattened electronic medical records;health systems;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;patient clusters;health care;LOS difference;facility utilization;Diseases;Hypertension;Diabetes;Heart;Clustering algorithms;Electronic medical records},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.49},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={188-194},   abstract={Communication technology improvements have inspired the idea of connecting almost every things to the Internet: from home appliances, medical devices, and cars, to large infrastructures. A unified and secure network of these things is almost a dream because the Internet has not had this goal from the beginning; protocols have been implemented and then secured, and then extended to new domains. This has been the cause of many vulnerabilities so far. In this paper, we take a fundamental look at the inherited architectural security issues of Internet of Things (IoT) which have raised serious security concerns due to its overwhelming number of nodes. Then, we investigate Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA), a very promising network architecture, as a design solution; we demonstrate how RINA can specifically address security challenges of IoT networks, and how it mitigates their common attacks. Moreover, we will show how RINA can provide other features which are now mentioned as the future trend in IoT.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;internetworking;RINA;unified network;secure network;IoT networks;recursive internetwork architecture;network architecture;Internet of Things;architectural security issues;Security;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Routing protocols;IEEE 802.15 Standard},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390263},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

The feeding point can be located at the bottom of the zipper, and to be more specific, around one of the teeth. The excitation at certain tooth of the zipper would bring variations in the reflection coefficients as well as the radiation patterns. No matter the zipper is totally closed, quarterly opened, half opened, or is even totally opened, the antenna can operate with acceptable performance, though the common status of the handbag zipper is closed. Thus, it is to some extent reconfigurable, especially for radiation patterns. A fractional bandwidth of 4.92% at 2.44 GHz of the industrial, scientific, and medical band with a gain of about 5 dBi has been achieved. The impact of the human body has been evaluated. It is noticeable but affordable. The measured results indicate reasonable agreements to that of the simulations in both the matching performance and the radiation feature for the zipper antenna, which seems to be a promising candidate for body-centric wireless communications and the Internet of Things.},   keywords={antenna feeds;antenna radiation patterns;body area networks;Internet of Things;UHF antennas;wearable antennas;handbag zipper antenna;body-centric wireless communication;Internet of Things;feeding point;reflection coefficients;radiation patterns;fractional bandwidth;industrial, scientific, and medical band;radiation feature;matching performance;Body-centric communication;Internet of Things (IoT);off-body antenna;wearable antenna;zipper antenna},   doi={10.1109/TAP.2017.2743046},   ISSN={0018-926X},   month={Oct},}

This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task.

  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={1},   pages={52-62},   abstract={Recently, most wireless network security schemes merely based on physical layer characteristics tackle the two fundamental issues-device authentication and secret key extraction separately. It remains an open problem to simultaneously achieve device authentication and fast secret key extraction merely using wireless physical layer characteristics, without the help of advanced hardware or out-of-band channel. In this paper, we answer this open problem in the setting of wireless body area networks (BANs). We propose MASK-BAN, a lightweight fast authenticated secret key extraction scheme for intra-BAN communication. Our scheme neither introduces advanced hardware nor relies on out-of-band channels. To perform device authentication and fast secret key extraction at the same time, we exploit the heterogeneous channel characteristics among the collection of on-body channels during body motion. On one hand, MASK-BAN achieves authentication through multihop stable channels, which greatly reduces the false positive rate as compared to existing work. On the other hand, based on dynamic channels, key extraction between two on-body devices with multihop relay nodes is modeled as a max-flow problem, and a novel collaborative secret key generation algorithm is introduced to maximize the key generation rate. Extensive real-world experiments on low-end commercial-off-the-shelf sensor devices validate MASK-BAN's great authentication capability and high-secret key generation rate.},   keywords={body area networks;private key cryptography;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication security;wireless channels;MASK-BAN;movement-aided authenticated secret key extraction;body area networks;wireless network security schemes;device authentication;wireless physical layer characteristics;intra-BAN communication;out-of-band channels;on-body channels;body motion;relay nodes;Authentication;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system security;Medical services;Internet of Things;Medical devices;Intelligent sensors;Biomedical monitoring;;Authenticated key generation;physical layer;received signal strength (RSS);sensor;wireless body area network (WBAN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2391113},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.},   keywords={health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;healthcare;patient confidence;HealthSense;peer to peer database;blockchain-Internet of Things model;bio-sensor;patient medical status;smart contract;inter planetary file system;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Contracts;Internet of Things;Biological system modeling;Conferences;BlockchInternet of Things;InterPlanetary File System;MQTT;Representational State Transfer},   doi={10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389459},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={An Examination of Inefficiencies in Key Dependent Variations of the Rijndael S-Box}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1658-1663},   abstract={Substitution boxes, or s-boxes, provide the primary source of non-linearity in symmetric cryptographic primitives. There are a variety methodologies used to design s-boxes. One method, that is widely used, is an s-box that is created at execution time, based on the cipher key. These are usually termed key-dependent s-boxes. Such s-box designs have been demonstrated to be sufficiently secure. However, what has not been adequately studied, is whether the additional overhead required by key-dependent s-boxes actually improves the nonlinearity of the algorithm, or is offset by a decrease in efficiency. Efficiency in algorithms is a growing concern due to devices with limited processing power. Internet of Things (Io‘T), implanted medical devices, and sensors all require security which includes encryption. However, these devices have limited processing power. Additional processing overhead may be counterproductive. This current study examines two questions. The first being how much additional overhead is introduced by key-dependent s-boxes. The focus for this study is on key dependent variations of the Rijndael cipher. The current study shows that while key-dependent variations of Rijndael are sufficiently secure, they do not demonstrate improved non-linearity over the standard Rijndael s-box, and do introduce additional processing overhead. This indicates these key-dependent variations of Rijndael may not have any advantage, and are contra indicated for implementations with limited processing resources.},   keywords={Ciphers;Linearity;Force;Design methodology;Standards;symmetric ciphers;s-box;key dependent s-box;loT encryption},   doi={10.1109/ICEE.2018.8472462},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={216-220},   abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},   keywords={assisted living;body sensor networks;cloud computing;gait analysis;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sensor fusion;multisensor IoT;assistive device;discrete gait monitoring;deployable gait monitoring;global healthcare system;chronic disease;wearable devices;particular impairments;mobility impairments;walkers;assistive technologies;unobtrusive activity monitoring;mobile device;multisensor fusion algorithm;health monitoring;gait cycles;hybrid sensorized canes;cloud storage;Monitoring;Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Instruments;Stability analysis;Aging;Sociology},   doi={10.1109/HIC.2017.8227623},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Injection Flaws are serious software vulnerability, and are listed on The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. Injection flaws are introduced when the input data is supplied to the interpreter without proper security validation. Using Whitelist is an efficient input data validation strategy to avoid Injection Flaws attacks. In this paper, an improved object pool management method which provides properly validated input data as an object is proposed. Since pre-validated input, as a form of objects are managed through the object pool pattern, the object pool works as a white list and it helps prevent Injection Flaw attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that any performance degradation can be compensated by reduced object construction time, since objects in the object pool don't need construction.},   keywords={embedded systems;Internet of Things;security of data;object pool realization;whitelist strategies;injection flaws;smart heath care system;IOT systems;open Web application security project;OWASP;efficient input data validation strategy;improved object pool management method;Security;Software;Storage area networks;Medical services;Hardware;Computers;Educational institutions},   doi={10.1109/ICITCS.2014.7021734},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Systems that offer AAL technologies make extensive use of personal data in order to provide services that are context-aware and personalized. This makes privacy preservation a very important issue especially since the users are not always aware of the privacy risks they could face. A lot of progress has been made in the deep learning field, however, there has been lack of research on privacy preservation of sensitive personal data with the use of deep learning. In this paper we focus on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder, which is a principal component of deep learning, and propose a new encoding technique that allows the creation of different AAL data views, depending on the access level of the end user and the information they require access to. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated with experiments on a simulated AAL dataset. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns privacy operations such as disclosure, deletion and generalization and can perform encoding and decoding of the data with almost perfect recovery.},   keywords={Privacy;Machine learning;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Decoding;Assisted living},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480247},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

However, the stringent regulations on the usage of certain industrial, scientific, and medical bands in many countries in which LPWAN operate limit the amount of time IoT motes can occupy the shared bands. This is particularly challenging in industrial scenarios, where not being able to report some detected events might result in the failure of critical assets. To alleviate this, and by mathematically modeling LPWAN-based IoT motes, we have derived optimal transmission policies that maximize the number of reported events (prioritized by their importance) while still complying with current regulations. The proposed solution has been customized for two widely known LPWAN technologies: 1) LoRa and 2) Sigfox.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Planning the deployment of antennas in complex environments is a difficult task that requires the analysis of each specific scenario. In many cases, real measurements are taken so as to map signal strengths, interferences, and so on. However, taking real measurements is very time consuming and becomes impractical in complex, large scenarios. With the aim to avoid this burden, simulation techniques based on Ray Tracing, combining Geometric Optics and Uniform Theory of Diffraction, are used to predict waves' behaviour within a given environment. Those simulations depend on a number of parameters, namely angular resolution, number of rebounds, cells size, etc. By tuning these parameters, high-definition (HD) and low-definition (LD) results can be obtained. Although more practical than manual measurements, the computational cost of simulations in HD prevents their use in complex environments and their LD counterparts are applied. In this article we propose a technique based on collaborative filtering (CF) that allows the use of LD simulations (with low computational cost) by lessening their low quality problems. The proposed CF strategy exploits spacial constraints in 2D propagation planes to improve simulation results, which end up being very similar to those of HD, with a fraction of its computational cost.},   keywords={collaborative filtering;Internet of Things;medical computing;wireless channels;two-dimensional collaborative filtering approach;wireless channel characterization;medical complex scenarios;antennas deployment planning;signal strengths;simulation techniques;ray tracing;geometric optics;uniform theory-of-diffraction;wave behaviour;angular resolution;rebound number;cells size;high-definition results;low-definition results;complex environments;collaborative filtering;low-quality problems;2D propagation planes;IoT;Databases;High definition video;Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Computational efficiency;Filtering;Wireless Channel Characterization;Collaborative Filtering;Ray Launching;Smart Health},   doi={10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580801},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

This paper describes an IoT-based approach to the management intervention of type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is a major chronic disease with significant economic and social impact worldwide. Specifically, we focus on the structure, functionality, and development process of MyDay, which is an IoT-based, multi-faceted self-management problem solving tool for pediatric T1D patients. By leveraging IoT technologies, MyDay can connect with various devices to integrate traditionally paper-documented physiological data (e.g., blood glucose values) in real-time with psychosocial and contextual data, such as mood, stress, and social activities. By integrating relevant-but heterogeneous-data sources, MyDay can create personalized feedback for self-awareness of factors associated with diabetes self-management patterns and promote data sharing and problem solving. Iterative user-centered design cycles were used throughout the development of MyDay to document and/or troubleshoot feasibility and technical stability, optimize feedback for effective health communication through data visualization, identify barriers to app use, optimize assessment, and evaluate capability of the app as a problem solving tool.

We focus on measuring real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitoring using a smartphone case. With the increasing number of cardiac patients worldwide, this design can be used for early detection of heart diseases. Unlike most of the existing methods that use an optical sensor to monitor heart rate, our approach is to measure real-time ECG with dry electrodes placed on smartphone case. The collected ECG signal can be stored and analyzed in real time through a smartphone application for prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed hardware system consists of a single chip microcontroller (RFduino) embedded with Bluetooth low energy, hence miniaturizing the size and prolonging battery life. The system called “smart case” has been tested in a laboratory environment. We also designed a 3-D printed smartphone case to validate the feasibly of the system.

 title={Optimized Deep Learning for EEG Big Data and Seizure Prediction BCI via Internet of Things}, 
  year={2017},   volume={3},   number={4},   pages={392-404},   abstract={A brain-computer interface (BCI) for seizure prediction provides a means of controlling epilepsy in medically refractory patients whose site of epileptogenicity cannot be resected but yet can be defined sufficiently to be selectively influenced by strategically implanted electrodes. Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.},   keywords={Big Data;brain-computer interfaces;diseases;electroencephalography;feature extraction;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;principal component analysis;patient-specific BCI;ECoG clinical datasets;automatic computing;cloud-computing solution;independent component analysis;extended optimization approach;epileptic seizure prediction;BCI seizure prediction;deep learning;cloud computing;real-time processing;significant processing delays;electrode contacts;prediction task;manually extracted features;ictal patterns;electrographic ictal behavior;real-time solutions;medically refractory patients;brain-computer interface;seizure prediction BCI;EEG big data;optimized deep;Big Data;Electroencephalography;Cloud computing;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Electrodes;Brain-computer interfaces;Predictive models;BCI;EEG big data;cloud computing;deep learning;epilepsy;seizure prediction and localization},   doi={10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2769670},   ISSN={2332-7790},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={28019-28027},   abstract={With the application of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in smart city, intelligent medical terminals play a more and more significant role in our daily life. These terminals can monitor our physical conditions and get lots of medical data in time. For the sake of data security and practicality, the collected big data can be encrypted and then stored on a cloud server such that only authorized users, such as the data owner and the doctors, can access. However, smart terminals are usually limited in computing power and users' privacy issues remain. To tackle this challenging problem, an efficient medical data sharing scheme is presented in this paper. To solve the privacy issues in users' data sharing, we utilize attribute-based encryption to enable data sharing. In addition, we remove the attribute matching function and use the attribute bloom filter to hide all the attributes in the access control structure. In order to improve the efficiency of encryption, we introduce the online/offline encryption technology in the encryption phase. Before the message is known, a large amount of work that is needed at the encryption stage will be done. Then, once the message is known, the ciphertext can be generated quickly. Besides, the initialization stage of the system does not need to specify all attributes. When the overall attributes of the system users increase, the system does not need to be reinitialized, which will also improve the system efficiency. Security analysis and performance analysis show that the data sharing scheme is secure and can improve data processing ability in IoT based data sharing.},   keywords={authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;Internet of Things;medical computing;Internet of Things technologies;IoT-based data sharing;online-offline encryption technology;privacy-preserving medical data sharing;access control structure;attribute bloom filter;attribute matching function;efficient medical data sharing scheme;smart terminals;data owner;authorized users;data security;intelligent medical terminals;smart city;limited computing power;encryption stage;Encryption;Access control;Servers;Privacy;Data privacy;Attribute-based encryption;data share;attribute bloom filter;privacy-preserving},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2840504},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option.

However, most of these technologies are expensive, can only be used in laboratory environments, and examine only a few trials of each movement action. In this paper, we present a novel ambulatory motion analysis framework using wearable inertial sensors to accurately assess all of an athlete's activities in real training environment. We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.},   keywords={discrete wavelet transforms;gradient methods;medical signal processing;signal classification;sport;automatic activity classification;movement assessment;sports training session;motion analysis technologies;wearable inertial sensors;discrete wavelet transform;DWT;computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm;curve-shift registration technique;random forest classifier;Motion control;Medical devices;Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Accelerometers;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Injuries;Activity classification;Wearable inertial sensor;Technique assessment;Sensor fusion;Knee joint angle;Curve shift registration;Biomechanics;Smart and connected health;Activity classification;biomechanics;curve shift registration;knee joint angle;sensor fusion;smart and connected health;technique assessment;wearable inertial sensor},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2377238},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

Common diabetic test on patients are done on urinary test and blood ketone test to monitor for diabetes condition. However, those methods are considers as invasive, inconvenient and expensive. Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors. This research is significant where patients can independently monitor their diabetic health and the IoT system can be alerted directly to medial officers in the hospitals.},   keywords={biomedical measurement;blood;diseases;gas sensors;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;wireless LAN;diabetic patients;noninvasive breath test;diabetic ketoacidosis;type 1 diabetes mellitus;urinary test;blood ketone test;breath acetone;ketone biomarker;breath measurement;IoT-based personal health care monitoring device;diabetic test;handheld health care;hardware connection;Internet of things system;patients exhalation;patient diagnosis;personal monitoring;Arduino board;gas sensor;mouthpiece;ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module;Diabetes;Databases;Monitoring;Data collection;Gas detectors;Wireless fidelity;Temperature sensors;ketone;personal monitoring system;acetone;exhaled breath;Internet of Things;sensor},   doi={10.1109/ISCAIE.2017.8074971},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Due to the high subjectivity involved in scanning and semi-skilled nature of the operating person, this assumption may not always be valid. The remotely scanned ultrasound video contains a lot of redundant information, which is not useful for diagnosis. Transmitting redundant and large volumes of medical data to the expert end for analysis may lead to faulty diagnosis, associated with high transmission cost, and also poses serious challenges on data storage, processing, infrastructure, etc. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel WebRTC based framework to detect representative frames in the ultrasound video and transmit only those frames to the remote sonographer for getting a diagnosis. Detection of representative frames in ultrasound video is done with invariant scattering convolution network. The entire framework is developed using WebRTC, which enables the browser to browser communication thus reducing the computation on end ultrasound scanner and ensures ubiquitous and secured connectivity between technician and the sonographer. The proposed video validation algorithm achieved an accuracy of 96.5% in classifying the representative frames and nonrepresentative frames in the ultrasound video.},   keywords={biomedical ultrasonics;Internet of Things;medical image processing;telemedicine;video signal processing;data storage;ultrasound video;remote sonographer;invariant scattering convolution network;WebRTC;video validation algorithm;ultrasonic videos;transmitted medical ultrasound videos;faulty diagnosis;IoT enabled tele-sonography;ultrasound scanner;Ultrasonic imaging;Videos;Feature extraction;Scattering;WebRTC;Medical diagnostic imaging},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355197},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1-12},   abstract={Heart sounds deliver vital physiological and pathological evidence about health. Wireless cardiac auscultation offers continuous cardiac monitoring of an individual without 24*7 manual healthcare care services. In this paper, a novel wireless sensing system to monitor and analyze cardiac condition is proposed, which sends the information to the caregiver as well as a medical practitioner with an application of the Internet of Things (IoT). An integrated system for heart sound acquisition, storage, and asynchronous analysis has been developed, from scratch to information uploading through IoT and signal analysis. Cardiac auscultation sensing unit has been designed to monitor cardiovascular health of an individual. Bluetooth protocol is used to offer power efficiency and moderate data transmission rate. The Hilbert-Huang transform is used to eliminate interference signals and to help to extract the heart sound signal features. Subsequence segmentation algorithm based on double-threshold has been developed to extract physiological parameters. Preprocessing, segmentation, and clustering technique were performed for significant health information interpretation. The cardiac auscultation monitoring system may provide a way for heart disease self-management.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Bluetooth;cardiovascular system;diseases;health care;Hilbert transforms;Internet of Things;medical information systems;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient care;patient monitoring;pattern clustering;power efficiency;data transmission rate;Hilbert-Huang transform;heart sound signal feature extraction;subsequence segmentation algorithm;clustering technique;Bluetooth protocol;Internet of Things;health information interpretation;manual healthcare care services;interference signals;moderate data transmission rate;cardiovascular health;cardiac auscultation sensing unit;signal analysis;information uploading;asynchronous analysis;heart sound acquisition;integrated system;IoT;medical practitioner;cardiac condition;wireless sensing system;continuous cardiac monitoring;wireless cardiac auscultation;pathological evidence;vital physiological evidence;heart disease self-management;cardiac auscultation monitoring system;physiological parameters;Heart;Sensors;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Stethoscope;Bluetooth;Wireless communication;Heart sound;IoT;Hilbert-Huang transform;double-threshold},   doi={10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2847329},   ISSN={2168-2372},   month={},}

However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively.

In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs - and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation - are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed.

Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Distributed Bayesian inference or estimation in Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received much attention due to its broad application in the areas of object classification, target tracking and medical diagnosis etc. In many distributed IoT systems with limited resources, e.g. sensor networks and crowdsourcing systems, it is likely that only a few agents will have valuable information at any given time. Therefore, the paradigm of information-driven distributed sensing (IDDS) is essential to achieve efficient inference, where the resources are spent only on sensing and communicating valuable information. In this paper, we consider the problem of IDDS for efficient Bayesian inference with exponential family distributions. We first propose a centralized algorithm (C-IDDS) where a centralized controller exists to make sensing decisions for the sensing agents. As the centralized algorithm does not scale well in large systems, we continue to design a distributed algorithm (D-IDDS) where each individual sensing agents can make their own sensing decisions independently. Both C-IDDS and D-IDDS are online algorithms which can adapt to stochastic system conditions without any future information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithms can achieve an asymptotically optimal system-wide utility. A real testbed has been built to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in real-world environments. Using the data from the real-world testbed and comparing with some baseline methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed C-IDDS and D-IDDS algorithms.},   keywords={Bayes methods;belief networks;distributed algorithms;distributed sensors;inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;target tracking;distributed IoT systems;sensor networks;crowdsourcing systems;distributed sensing;exponential family distributions;centralized algorithm;C-IDDS;centralized controller;sensing decisions;distributed algorithm;individual sensing agents;online algorithms;stochastic system conditions;asymptotically optimal system-wide utility;D-IDDS algorithms;object classification;Bayesian inference;Internet of Things systems;information-driven distributed sensing;Sensors;Inference algorithms;Energy consumption;Bayes methods;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Scheduling},   doi={10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397111},   ISSN={2155-5494},   month={June},}

Embedded sensors of the mobile device provide additional useful status information (such as: user location, magnetic or noise level, acceleration, temperature, etc.). The user interface of our software solution is suitable for different skilled users, highly configurable and provides diary functionality to store information (about sleep problems, can act as a diet log, or even can be used as a pain diary).

This provides ample information regarding the citizens in various smart environments. We can leverage this people-centric information, provided by the smart city infrastructure, to improve “smart health” applications: user data from connected wearable devices can be accompanied with ubiquitous environmental sensing and versatile actuation. The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation. In this paper, we apply our modular approach for IoT applications - the context engine - to smart health problems, enabling the ability to grow with available data, use general-purpose machine learning, and reduce compute redundancy and complexity. For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment. We demonstrate the potential with three sets of interconnected context-aware applications, extracting health-related people-centric context, such as user presence, user activity, air quality, and location from IoT sensors.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;smart cities;IoT applications;smart health problems;smart city environment;interconnected context-aware applications;Internet of Things;personalized smart health application design;modular smart health application design;smart connected city;health-related people-centric context extraction;health-related conditions;general-purpose machine learning;heterogeneous data;distributed low-capacity computing;connected wearable devices;user data;smart health applications;smart city infrastructure;people-centric information;smart environments;ubiquitous environmental user sensing;Context;Internet of Things;Complexity theory;Smart cities;Engines;Intelligent sensors;Context-aware computation;Internet of Things (IoT);personalized health-care;smart health},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2712558},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

Applications of CPS span various fields such as medical monitoring, traffic control, and smart grid. With such widespread applications, privacy assurance is becoming more and more important since what the CPS connects are people and the real world. Any leakage of private information will cause serious consequences. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the secrecy of wireless communications in CPS by use of physical layer security techniques. Specifically, we study an amplify and forward (AF) relay network where all devices are equipped with a single antenna. We propose a privacy-enhanced waveform design approach aided by artificial noise (AN) to enhance the communication secrecy in a wireless environment with multipath receptions. First, we consider the case with perfect eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI). We optimize the AF coefficient for forwarding the informationbearing signal and the AN covariance to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. The optimal solution is obtained by solving a series of semidefinite programs. Then, a more practical scenario with imperfect eavesdropper's CSI is studied. We develop a robust waveform design method and obtain the lower bound of the achievable secrecy rate. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},   keywords={data privacy;optimisation;radio networks;radio transmitters;telecommunication security;wireless communications privacy;security-aware waveforms;robust waveform design method;multipath receptions;cyber-physical system;engineered system;physical world;CPS span various fields;medical monitoring;privacy assurance;CPS connects;private information;physical layer security techniques;privacy-enhanced waveform design approach;communication secrecy;wireless environment;perfect eavesdropper;Relays;Privacy;Wireless communication;Security;Covariance matrices;Cyber-physical systems;Protocols;Cyber-physical system (CPS);physical layer security (PLS);privacy;relay transmission;waveform design;wireless communications},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2684221},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

The topographical map of the brain is divided into different regions and synchrony measures are computed between these different regions to identify the region responsible for epileptic seizure. The molecular and biochemical process of seizure generation during pre-ictal period is essential for seizure to start and this property has been investigated here in EEG signals to predict the onset of epileptic seizure. Particular region of the brain responsible for seizure is identified by pairing the EEG signals from different regions of brain and identifying the changes in synchrony measures corresponding to those regions. Two synchrony measures one from time domain, correlation, and other from frequency domain, coherence, are used in this work to validate the observations. Coherence and correlation increases in pre-ictal state and hence seizure onset can be predicted in advance. The results shows that epileptogenic region of the brain can also be identified.},   keywords={brain;correlation methods;electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;electroencephalogram;coherence synchrony;frequency domain synchrony;correlation synchrony;time domain synchrony;pre-ictal period;seizure generation molecular process;seizure generation biochemical process;brain topographical map;EEG signal synchrony analysis;brain epileptogenic region identification;epileptic seizure prediction;Electroencephalography;Correlation;Coherence;Electrodes;Epilepsy;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;coherence;correlation;electro encephalo gram (EEG);epilepsy;seizure},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380644},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={10594-10604},   abstract={The conditions of the environment where a person lives have a great impact on his wellness state. When buying a new house, it is important to select a place that aids in improving the wellness state of the buyer or, at least, keeps it at the same level. A deficient wellness state implies an increase of stress and the appearance of some effects associated with it. Heart rate variability (HRV) allows measuring the stress or wellness levels of a person by measuring the difference in time between heartbeats. A low HRV is related to high stress levels whereas a high HRV is associated with a high wellness state. In this paper, we present a system that measures the wellness and stress levels of home buyers by employing sensors that measure the HRV. Our system is able to process the data and recommend the best neighborhood to live in considering the wellness state of the buyer. Several tests were performed utilizing different locations. In order to determine the best neighborhood, we have developed an algorithm that assigns different values to the area in accordance with the HRV measures. Results show that the system is effective in providing the recommendation of the place that would allow the person to live with the highest wellness state.},   keywords={Big Data;biomedical measurement;cardiology;medical computing;BigData;stress levels;wellness state;heart rate variability;Heart rate variability;Stress;Stress measurement;Psychology;Biomedical monitoring;Sensors;Wellness;heart rate variability;heart rate;stress;BigData;real estate},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2702107},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, interference from other co-located BANs or other nearby devices sharing the same spectrum may cause unacceptable QoS degradation. The impact of such degradations can be minimized by using adaptive schemes that intelligently adjust relevant parameters at the transmitting or receiving nodes of a BAN. This paper provides a framework for low complexity regret minimization based algorithms for Energy Detection Threshold (EDT) adaptation in the transmitter node of a BAN. The nodes are assumed to be using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol according to the IEEE 802.15.6 BAN standard.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The ADHD (Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity) is a brain disorder and whose main characteristics are inattention, restlessness and impulsivity. It has its onset in childhood (it occurs in 3 to 5% of the children in the world), being able to accompany the individual throughout its life, although some symptoms become more soft throughout the life.In adults, most problems are related to the difficulty of organizing, planning, managing time, remembering dates, appointments, objects, among others. With the advancement of technology, several solutions have emerged to help our day-to-day life, as well as for peoples with some type of disability, giving them a greater autonomy.In this context, we have the IoT (Internet of Things), one of the solutions with great potential to provide this autonomy, since we can provide several devices, for example, to monitor our blood pressure or body temperature, without the need to be in a hospital.This work proposes a solution, based on IoT, to help the daily activities of an adult person with ADHD. For this, was developed a tool that is able to remember activities and possible lost objects. The evaluation carried out over the proposed solution was based on a questionnaire applied to specialized professionals. The results obtained so far, show that the tool has demonstrated a great potential to help people with ADHD.},   keywords={brain;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;day-to-day life;IoT;Internet of Things;blood pressure;daily activities;body temperature;childhood;impulsivity;restlessness;brain disorder;Hyperactivity;Deficit Disorder;adult patients;daily life;ADHD;adult person;Sensors;Monitoring;Organizations;Internet of Things;Mobile communication;Tools},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254442},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Quite recently in IEEE Internet of Things Journal (DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828463), Liu et al. proposed a large-scale concurrent data anonymous batch verification scheme for mobile healthcare crowd sensing, claiming to provide batch authentication, non-repudiation, and anonymity. However, after a close look at the scheme, we point out that the scheme suffers two types of signature forgery attacks and hence fails to achieve the claimed security properties. In addition, a reasonable and rigorous probability analysis indicates that the security reduction from the security of the scheme to the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem is invalid. We hope that similar design flaws can be avoided in future design of anonymous batch verification schemes for mobile healthcare crowd sensing.},   keywords={Sensors;Internet of Things;Medical services;Public key;Authentication;Indexes;Cryptanalysis;Mobile healthcare crowd sensing;Anonymity;Batch authentication.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2862381},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Hence, they can be used in variety of applications like smart city, smart energy, and healthcare etc. Doctor-patient ratio in India is well below the global average. So, IoT can have profound effect on healthcare in India. Healthcare organizations must be prepared to play critical role in managing and analyzing huge volumes of data received from all health and fitness devices. In healthcare, several companies offer remote healthcare services through their platforms. However, most these platforms are proprietary. They can provide data and services to the specific devices and their proprietary servers. But these platforms cannot provide integration services, as they cannot communicate each other. They follow different standards or use different communication protocols. Management and interoperability of data is very important in healthcare.

The diseases which include various ailments in the form of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. These diseases are the main cause of hospitalization for elder people. People who have suffered from chronic diseases are needed to repeatedly monitor the vital signs periodically. The vital signs are the basic measurements of body functions. The vital signs of our body are heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood glucose level. The respiratory rate monitor is one of the important vital signs which is useful for patient's who admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The respiratory rate is calculated by using LM35 temperature sensor and monitored the patient's respiration continuously based on voltage value of inhaled and exhaled air. NRF24l01 is used to transmit the sensor data from home to medical center. Then the data are published in a webserver using Ethernet to know the patient's status which is useful for doctor.

They usually come with a voice-enabled feature to add an extra level of usability and convenience to elderly, disabled people, and patients. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},   keywords={cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition;privacy-preserving voice-based search;mHealth data;in-home IoT devices;healthcare systems;smart personal assistants;voice-enabled feature;elderly;disabled people;patients;in-home healthcare applications;voice recording;voice upload;voice content;mood;tone;background sound;voice data privacy;speech recognition;homomorphic encryption;encrypted voice data;caregiver queries;voice feature similarity;Servers;Databases;Encryption;Data privacy;Medical services;Speech recognition},   doi={10.1109/CHASE.2017.66},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

 title={A Fog Based Middleware for Automated Compliance With OECD Privacy Principles in Internet of Healthcare Things}, 
  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={8418-8441},   abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;middleware;distributed data collection protocol;IoHT devices;intensive privacy preserving processes;privacy regulation frameworks;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;concealment process;holistic privacy middleware;personal gateways;sensitive health information;cloud-based healthcare services;accountability act;health insurance portability;personal health information;privacy laws;healthcare data;healthcare provider;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;living organism;healthcare Web services;hospital setting;personalized health insights;health data;healthcare delivery;Internet of Healthcare Things;healthcare things;OECD privacy principles;automated compliance;fog based middleware;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data privacy;Data models;Logic gates;Privacy;Internet of things;Patient monitoring;Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

They need to gather the data from the surrounding environment, and they need a sensor interface. These robots can be worked with IoT environment. In fact, in traditional methods the number of sensors connected are minimized, sampling rate is less and even has a restriction over types of signal in sensors. Using reconfigurable smart sensor interface the complexity of the code can be reduced in IoT environment. In the proposed system, FPGA is taken as the main logic controller. It can parallel process the data in real time. It is smaller in size and has finer grain capability. It works faster than CPLD. This system uses IEEE1451.2 standard; this gives an intelligent sensor interface between sensors in robot.

However, it still faces many severe challenges on the privacy of users&amp;#x2019; health information and the accuracy of diagnosis result, which deter the wide adoption of online medical primary diagnosis system. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online medical primary diagnosis framework (CINEMA). Within CINEMA framework, users can access online medical primary diagnosing service accurately without divulging their medical data. Specifically, based on fast secure permutation and comparison technique, the encrypted user&amp;#x2019;s query is directly operated at the service provider without decryption, and the diagnosis result can only be decrypted by the user, meanwhile, the diagnosis model in service provider can also be protected. Through extensive analysis, we show that CINEMA can ensure that user&amp;#x2019;s health information and healthcare service provider&amp;#x2019;s diagnosis model are kept confidential, and has significantly reduce computation and communication overhead.

  year={2013},   volume={13},   number={10},   pages={3793-3805},   abstract={Everyday around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created. There is also a growing trend toward integrating real world data into the Internet, which is provided by sensory devices, smart phones, GPS, and many other sources that capture and communicate real world data. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real world objects (i.e., Things). This paper focuses on how to optimize the data exchange between the sensory devices and applications in IoT and Cyber-Physical systems. In particular, a method to construct higher-level abstractions of data at local gateways is proposed. This will reduce the traffic load imposed on the communication networks that provide the real world data. The proposed method is based on an information processing algorithm where gateways analyze the data collected from the sensors and create higher level abstractions. We enhance the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) algorithm that is used as a building block of the abstraction creation framework, into an optimized version for sensor data, called sensor SAX. We extend the parsimonious covering theory that is usually used for medical purposes with a probabilistic parsimonious criterion in the temporal domain to infer abstractions based on time-dependent sensor data. The proposed method is analyzed and evaluated over a real world data set and the results are discussed in terms of the data size reduction, accuracy, and latency needed to create the abstractions.},   keywords={approximation theory;data structures;Internet;Internet of Things;probability;information abstraction;heterogeneous real world Internet data;Internet of Things;data exchange;cyber-physical systems;higher-level abstractions;local gateways;information processing algorithm;symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm;sensor SAX algorithm;parsimonious covering theory;probabilistic parsimonious criterion;medical purposes;Information abstraction;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2013.2271562},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={Oct},}

Sometimes, it is necessary to make dynamic updates to the hierarchy, in order to implement an access control policy which evolves with time. All security models for hierarchical key assignment schemes have been designed to cope with static hierarchies and do not consider the issue of performing dynamic updates to the hierarchy. In this paper, we define the concept of hierarchical key assignment schemes supporting dynamic updates, formalizing the relative security model. In particular, we provide the notion of security with respect to key indistinguishability, by considering the dynamic changes to the hierarchy. Moreover, we show how to construct a hierarchical key assignment scheme supporting dynamic updates, by using as a building block a symmetric encryption scheme. The proposed construction is provably secure with respect to key indistinguishability, and provides efficient key derivation and updating procedures, while requiring each user to store only a single private key.},   keywords={authorisation;private key cryptography;key derivation;symmetric encryption scheme;key indistinguishability;dynamic updates;static hierarchies;relative security model;encryption keys;private information;hierarchical key assignment scheme;dynamic structures;cryptographic hierarchical access control;Access control;Internet of things;Encryption;Medical services;Context;Sensors;Access control;key assignment;provable security;dynamic structures;adaptive adversary},   doi={10.1109/TIFS.2016.2581147},   ISSN={1556-6013},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={13},   number={5},   pages={2140-2150},   abstract={Data intensive analysis is the major challenge in smart cities because of the ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of sensors. The natural characteristic of geodistribution requires a new computing paradigm to offer location-awareness and latency-sensitive monitoring and intelligent control. Fog Computing that extends the computing to the edge of network, fits this need. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical distributed Fog Computing architecture to support the integration of massive number of infrastructure components and services in future smart cities. To secure future communities, it is necessary to integrate intelligence in our Fog Computing architecture, e.g., to perform data representation and feature extraction, to identify anomalous and hazardous events, and to offer optimal responses and controls.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={116-121},   abstract={Recently, loT based healthcare systems have evolved as a tool to enhance the quality of life of people. This kind of system allows medical professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) to verify continuously the health conditions of their patients. As the healthcare systems manage highly sensitive physiological information of patients such as blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse, they are extremely vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care. In Gope-Hwang scheme, the authors proposed a lightweight anonymous authentication protocol and claimed that their scheme was secure. Unfortunately, this paper finds that Gope-Hwang scheme still has security pitfalls and limitations. This paper describes and cryptanalyzes the Gope-Hwang scheme to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security limitations. Then, it proposes an enhanced lightweight anonymous authentication scheme that solves the discovered security flaws. Additionally, this work executes security and performance analysis to demonstrate how the proposed protocol is more appropriate for a safe healthcare systems..},   keywords={cryptographic protocols;health care;Internet of Things;message authentication;BSN-Care;gryptanalysis;authentication system;loT based health care systems;Internet of Things;security mechanism;Gope-Hwang scheme;lightweight anonymous authentication protocol;Servers;Authentication;Medical services;Protocols;Cryptography;Databases;sensor network;healthcare service;user authentication;security;BAN logic;Internet of things},   doi={10.1109/IRIS.2016.8066076},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={124-130},   abstract={With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated &amp; intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-2},   abstract={Despite the phenomenal advances in the computational power and functionality of electronic systems, human-machine interaction has largely been limited to simple control panels, keyboard, mouse and display. Consequently, these systems either rely critically on close human guidance or operate almost independently from the user. An exemplar technology integrated tightly into our lives is the smartphone. However, the term “smart” is a misnomer, since it has fundamentally no intelligence to understand its user. The users still have to type, touch or speak (to some extent) to express their intentions in a form accessible to the phone. Hence, intelligent decision making is still almost entirely a human task. A life-changing experience can be achieved by transforming machines from passive tools to agents capable of understanding human physiology and what their user wants [1]. This can advance human capabilities in unimagined ways by building a symbiotic relationship to solve real world problems cooperatively. One of the high-impact application areas of this approach is assistive internet of things (IoT) technologies for physically challenged individuals. The Annual World Report on Disability reveals that 15% of the world population lives with disability, while 110 to 190 million of these people have difficulty in functioning [1]. Quality of life for this population can improve significantly if we can provide accessibility to smart devices, which provide sensory inputs and assist with everyday tasks. This work demonstrates that smart IoT devices open up the possibility to alleviate the burden on the user by equipping everyday objects, such as a wheelchair, with decision-making capabilities. Moving part of the intelligent decision making to smart IoT objects requires a robust mechanism for human-machine communication (HMC). To address this challenge, we present examples of multimodal HMC mechanisms, where the modalities are electroencephalogram (EEG), speech commands, and motion sensing. We also introduce an IoT co-simulation framework developed using a network simulator (OMNeT++) and a robot simulation platform Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP). We show how this framework is used to evaluate the effectiveness of different HMC strategies using automated indoor navigation as a driver application.},   keywords={control engineering computing;decision making;electroencephalography;human-robot interaction;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical robotics;smart phones;virtualisation;human-machine communication;assistive IoT technologies;electronic systems;human-machine interaction;smartphone;intelligent decision making;human physiology;assistive Internet of Things;HMC;electroencephalogram;EEG;speech commands;motion sensing;network simulator;OMNeT++;robot simulation platform;virtual robot experimentation platform;V-REP},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Early detection of such infection cases is necessary to identify population at risk accurately and effectively. This paper introduces a systematic infection detection framework utilizing mobile communication technologies including mobile networking and encounter statistics during infection breakouts. Our target environment is smart connected hospitals using Internet of things. First, the disease infection trace-back problem is defined. Then a detailed practical framework is devised using wireless encounters to facilitate the trace-back to the infection source and identify the population at risk; the nodes that are likely infected. Trace back and filtering methods are then proposed using probabilistic forward and backward search techniques. We use extensive WLAN campus traces of six buildings with different mobility characteristics and over 34K users to drive our simulations. Metrics of true positive, true negative, accuracy and coverage are measured and presented. Our results thus far show promise, where in most cases the accuracy of correctly selecting the infected nodes that have been in the area during the epidemic period were found to reach 70-80% with population selection coverage close to the infection percentage of nodes.},   keywords={biomedical communication;diseases;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;wireless LAN;disease infection tracing;smart hospital;infection detection;mobile communication technology;mobile networking;Internet-of-things;probabilistic forward technique;backward search technique;WLAN campus trace;epidemic period;Hospitals;Sociology;Statistics;Diseases;Sensors;Wireless communication;Mobile communication},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763193},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Then, we compared alterations of frequency-specific functional hub across five different frequency bands in 21 GTCS patients to 22 normal control (NC) subjects. CTCS patients showed aberrant functional hubs predominately at some particular frequency bands and primary in the default mode network (DMN) and the somatomotor network (SMN).

Thus, designing efficient transceivers is crucial to reduce transmission delay and energy through leveraging data reduction techniques. In this context, we propose an efficient data-specific transceiver design that leverages the inherent characteristics of the generated data at the physical layer to reduce transmitted data size without significant overheads. The goal is to adaptively reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted in order to efficiently communicate and possibly store information, while maintaining the required application Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.

In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},   keywords={3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;3G-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;WiFi-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;ubiquitous real-time monitoring;data logging;sensor nodes;temperature data;ECG signals;Internet-of-Things functionality;serial-line-Internet-protocol;UbuntuOne;remote U-healthcare monitoring;3G connectivity;4G connectivity;Electrocardiography;Temperature sensors;Medical services;Servers;Clouds;Real-time systems;Internet},   doi={10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783258},   ISSN={1558-2531},   month={Feb},}

 title={Design of a low cost smart chair for telemedicine and IoT based health monitoring: An open source technology to facilitate better healthcare}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={89-94},   abstract={In this paper, we present a novel design of an Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine based health monitoring system-The Smart Chair. Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities. The results presented show that the proposed system is definitely a low cost affordable solution for IoT based telemedicine system, as compared to existing systems.},   keywords={Android (operating system);Bluetooth;electronic messaging;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;patient monitoring;public domain software;telemedicine;wireless LAN;remote doctor;design phase;low cost affordable solution;IoT based telemedicine system;low cost smart chair;IoT based health monitoring;open source technology;human body;physiological signals;health parameters;Internet of Things;physiological parameters;telemedicine based health monitoring system;The Smart Chair;raw signal processing;secured Web server;Wi-Fi module;remote location;Android application;Bluetooth;text file;Email;MMS;SMS;healthcare facilities;Microcontrollers;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Hardware;Temperature sensors;Heart rate;Remote Monitoring;Healthcare;Internet of Things;Telemedicine;Arduino;Android;Thingspeak},   doi={10.1109/ICIINFS.2016.8262913},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},   keywords={Protocols;Cyberattack;Internet of Things;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Critical infrastructure;Internet of Things;Cyber Attacks;Smart Grids;SCADA;Intelligent Transportation Systems;Smart Medical Systems;Smart Home;Critical Infrastructures.},   doi={10.1109/COMST.2018.2855563},   ISSN={1553-877X},   month={},}

Yet, we have barely scratched the surface. Using existing and new technologies, we are connecting the physical world to the Internet. It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Internet of Everything has top five applications; Traffic monitoring, Healthcare, Security, Transport and logistics, and Daily life. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an architectural framework to monitor the health of a patient with a diabetic illness in proactive and reactive monitoring behavior. This type of patients have difficulty maintaining healthy glucose levels which can be lead to a diabetic coma, where a patient becomes unconscious, and can die if left untreated. In the proposed system a patient has registries in the health monitoring company (HMC) to help him avoid diabetic comas and emergency visits to the hospital. He wears a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and a fitness tracker to monitor his exercise level and respiration. Based on the type of data transmission; proactive or reactive, these devices will process and provide the data for the health monitoring company to take the correct action when patient's state of health moves outside normal range.

As a solution, cryptographic system is often adopted to encrypt the data, and Random Number Generator (RNG) is of vital importance to such system. This paper proposes a new random number generation method for securing on-body IoT devices based on temporal signal variations of the outputs of the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) worn by the users while walking. As most new wearable and implantable devices have built-in IMUs and walking gait signals can be extracted from these body sensors, this method can be applied and integrated into the cryptographic systems of these new devices. To generate the random numbers, this method divides IMU signals into gait cycles and generates bits by comparing energy differences between the sensor signals in a gait cycle and the averaged IMU signals in multiple gait cycles. The generated bits are then re-indexed in descending order by the absolute values of the associated energy differences to further randomise the data and generate high-entropy random numbers. Two datasets were used in the studies to generate random numbers, where were rigorously tested and passed four well-known randomness test suites, namely NIST-STS, ENT, Dieharder, and RaBiGeTe.},   keywords={cryptography;entropy;gait analysis;Internet of Things;random number generation;on-body IoT devices;temporal signal variations;wearable devices;implantable devices;walking gait signals;body sensors;cryptographic system;gait cycle;sensor signals;averaged IMU signals;multiple gait cycles;generated bits;high-entropy random numbers;randomness test suites;Inertial Measurement unit signals;On-Body IoT Devices;wearable technologies;implantable technologies;random number generation method;inertial measurement unit signal;on-body Internet-of-Things devices;Random Number Generator (RNG);Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU);wearable security;IoT security},   doi={10.1049/cp.2018.0028},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2884-2895},   abstract={The recent proliferation of mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearable devices has given rise to crowdsourcing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients, and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure three-factor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card; 2) password; and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely accepted real-or-random model and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. With the combination of high security and appreciably low communication and computational overheads, our scheme is very much practical for battery limited devices for the healthcare applications as compared to other existing related schemes.},   keywords={authorisation;biometrics (access control);cryptographic protocols;formal verification;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;message authentication;mobile computing;public key cryptography;smart cards;battery limited devices;healthcare applications;chaotic map-based anonymous user authentication scheme;user biometrics;fuzzy extractor;Internet of Things applications;remote storage;ProVerif 1.93;real-or-random model;Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic;computational overheads;smart card;password;personal biometrics;formal security verification;expensive elliptic curve point multiplication;extended chaotic maps;three-factor user remote user authentication protocol;wireless communication;authorized users;medical server data;remote access;crowdsourcing IoT applications;e-healthcare service;wearable devices;mobile devices;Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Medical services;Internet of Things;Chaotic communication;Smart cards;Biometrics;Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic;chaotic map;crowdsourcing;Internet of Things (IoT);ProVerif 193;security;user authentication},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2714179},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

Their large-scale pervasive deployment within the population has already attracted many malware authors, cybercriminals, and even governments. Since the first demonstration of mobile malware by Marcos Velasco, millions of these have been developed with very sophisticated capabilities. They infiltrate highly secure networks using air-gap jumping capability (e.g., “Hammer Drill”and “Brutal Kangaroo”) and spread through heterogeneous computing and communication platforms. Some of these cross-platform malware attacks are capable of infiltrating isolated control systems which might be running a variety of operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Linux. This paper investigates cross-platform/heterogeneous mobile malware that uses removable media, such as USB connection, to spread between incompatible computing platforms and operating systems. Deep analysis and modeling of cross-platform mobile malware are conducted at the micro (infection) and macro (spread) levels. The micro-level analysis aims to understand the cross-platform malware states and transitions between these states during node-to-node infection. The micro-level analysis helps derive the parameters essential for macro-level analysis, which are also crucial for the elaboration of suitable detection and prevention solutions. The macro-level analysis aims to identify the most important factors affecting cross-platform mobile malware spread within a digitized population. Through simulation, we show that identifying these factors helps to mitigate any outbreaks.},   keywords={computer crime;invasive software;mobile computing;operating systems (computers);user interfaces;microlevel analysis;cross-platform malware states;macro-level analysis;heterogeneous mobile malware propagation;mobile personal devices;USB thumb drives;large-scale pervasive deployment;air-gap jumping capability;heterogeneous computing;communication platforms;cross-platform malware attacks;isolated control systems;cross-platform-heterogeneous mobile malware;Malware;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Computational modeling;Viruses (medical);Payloads;Universal Serial Bus;Smartphone;mobile;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile malware;coloured Petri nets (CPN) modelling;epidemic model;industrial control systems},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2772787},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={16-16},   abstract={Summary form only given. As people get excited about the latest idea for "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things", computer people often shake our heads and say "It won't scale." Pessimism isn't always justified: we have been able to scale up quite a number of tasks, from connectivity through search to social media. But other applications are recalcitrant, from energy management to medical records. The conventional computer-science view is that scaling systems is about computational complexity; about whether the storage or communications required for a task grows more than linearly in the number of users. Over the past thirty years we've developed a pretty good theory of that, but we're learning that it's nowhere near enough. In this talk I present a complementary view, based on over thirty years' experience of security engineering, that the real limits to scale are usually elsewhere. Even where the data are manageable and the algorithms straightforward, things can fail because of the scaling properties of the social context, the economic model or the regulatory environment. This makes some automation projects much harder than they seem. When it comes to safety and privacy many of the attacks that are easy to do in the lab are rare in the wild, as they don't scale either. But others surprise us; no-one in the intelligence community anticipated a leak on the Snowden scale. In short, scaling is now a problem not of computer science but of systems engineering, economics, governance and much else. Conceiving problems too narrowly makes failure likely, while good engineering will require ever more awareness of context. The implications for research, education and policy bear some thought.},   keywords={security of data;social aspects of automation;Big Data;Internet of Things;computer people;social media;energy management;medical records;computer-science view;computational complexity;security engineering;social context;economic model;regulatory environment;Context;Economics;Computer security;Big data;Internet of things;Computers;Head},   doi={10.1109/CSF.2016.41},   ISSN={2374-8303},   month={June},}

The approach avails itself of Genetic Programming to automatically find an explicit relationship between blood pressure values and photoplethysmography ones. This relationship is tested on a set of eleven subjects and compared against other regression methods, and turns out to be better.

Important elements of modern healthcare services are physical rehabilitation and injury prevention. Wearable sensor devices attached to the patient can offer valuable supplemental information to healthcare professionals during treatment or therapy. In physical rehabilitation, wearable inertial sensor devices help therapists to monitor and evaluate parameters and key performance indicators of the rehabilitation activities. Therapy efficiency can be increased by using real-time feedback systems. Three different feedback system architectures are defined and studied: therapist, user, and cloud system. A case study involving rehabilitation therapy based on swimming exercises was performed. Field test results show that the developed sensor device and real-time therapist feedback application provide sufficiently accurate and precise data for the efficient evaluation of swimming parameters, such as stroke time and stroke rotation angle symmetry. Rehabilitation therapists should be able to operate the system without the constant presence of trained and experienced technical personnel (engineers).

In the literature, several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed, most of them have focused only in content-oriented privacy, omitting the contextual privacy aspects. To cope with this deficiency, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme adapted to eHealth systems considering a normal and an emergency health scenarios. Our proposed scheme satisfies both content and contextual privacy requirements, as well as secure communications and quality of service (QoS). To do, we used an identity-based encryption scheme, a set of privacy mechanisms, and a prioritized queuing model. Moreover, we established a performance evaluation to study the queuing behavior of the proposed system. Extensive security analysis shows the robustness of our scheme. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed solution provides the first solution ensuring security as well as perfect privacy without neglecting any requirement.},   keywords={biomedical communication;computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;medical computing;patient monitoring;quality of service;queueing theory;QoS enabled privacy preserving solution;eHealth system;patient information sharing;content-oriented privacy;contextual privacy omission;emergency health scenario;normal health scenario;quality of service;identity-based encryption scheme;prioritized queuing model;Privacy;Medical services;Quality of service;Authentication;Sensors;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Security and Privacy;Content privacy;Contextual privacy;eHealth;Quality of Service},   doi={10.1109/PEMWN.2016.7842905},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Surface winds are often deflected or funneled. At times, the mariner in Puget Sound may find the weather vastly different from the shoreside real-time observations from NOAA sensors. During periods of high winds and maximum tidal currents, some ferries are prevented from safety landing or departing their moorings. Washington State Ferries sought a means to collect real-time meteorological data in the open waters of Puget Sound to assist operators with sailing decisions and to keep the public informed of schedule changes. In 1998, WSF implemented a Fleet Location System (FLS) using communications network services provided by Meteor Communications Corporation (MCC). The FLS uses a radio transceiver, with GPS positional inputs, to transmit ferry location, course speed and heading every thirty seconds. All FLS information is displayed on nautical charts at the WSF operations center and used as a system-wide management tool. Through a cooperative engineering effort, WSF and MCC will outfit six ferries normally used on the longest crossings with equipment to collect real-time meteorological data. A data logger, wind speed and wind direction sensor, barometric sensor and temperature and humidity sensor will be added. To each ferry. In addition, an interface to the ship's gyrocompass will be added to complete the calculations for true wind speed and direction. To gather only the necessary meteorological data, the sensors will report every fifteen minutes throughout Puget Sound.},   keywords={atmospheric techniques;wind;wind;geophysical signal processing;North Pacific;coast;United states;USA;Puget Sound;wind speed data collection system;atmosphere;meteorology;Washington;measurement technique;surface wind;real-time meteorological data;Fleet Location System;communications network;Meteor Communications Corporation;data logger;wind direction;Wind speed;Acoustic sensors;Temperature sensors;Meteorology;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Safety;Scheduling;Communication networks;Radio transceivers},   doi={10.1109/OCEANS.1999.804909},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states.

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors. The readings are shown in the form of graphs at IBM Watson IoT platform.},   keywords={Android (operating system);cloud computing;computerised monitoring;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;temperature sensors;transport protocols;remote health monitoring;Raspberry pi;medical science;Internet of Things;reduced clinical costs;pulse rate monitoring;body temperature;vital body parameters;Bluemix cloud;Bluemixuses MQTT;message queuing telemetry transport protocol;heart rate sensor;DS18B20;KG011;IBM Watson IoT platform;Temperature sensors;Medical services;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Sensor systems;Healthcare System;Internet of Things;Arduino UNO;Raspberry pi;cloud computing;IBM Bluemix cloud service},   doi={10.1109/CCAA.2017.8230004},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={581-588},   abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;end-to-end security;healthcare Internet-of-Things;IoT;smart gateways;DTLS session resumption technique;remote end-users;security context;session resumption technique;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;energy performance evaluations;remote patient monitoring prototype;Conferences;Computers;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing},   doi={10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={293-297},   abstract={With the advent of the Internet of Things, body-worn sensor nodes are continuously becoming more important. In case of bio-medical, rescue-worker or military applications sensitive data are often transmitted, requiring the need for encryption. The distribution of symmetric encryption keys is often an issue leading to security risks. Body-worn sensor nodes are generally employed in quickly varying channel conditions due to body movement. The radio-communication channel between such nodes is however reciprocal, allowing the extraction of an array of similar channel measurements at both ends of the link. These data can be used to build equal encryption keys at both link ends without the need for actual over-the-air key distribution. This paper studies the practical performance of an enhanced channel-based key generation system with a very short round-trip delay, allowing reciprocal channel assessment with increased accuracy. Measurements were performed using the new system and the results of the enhanced key generation are evaluated. Although the performance is slightly increased thanks to the shorter round-trip delay, the accuracy of the signal level detector still imposes limits.},   keywords={body sensor networks;channel estimation;cryptography;telecommunication security;channel estimation;body-worn sensor nodes;Internet of Things;bio-medical;rescue-worker;military;symmetric encryption keys;radiocommunication channel;over-the-air key distribution;channel-based key generation system;channel assessment;Antenna measurements;Wireless communication;Measurement uncertainty;Delays;Wireless sensor networks;Error analysis;Encryption;sensor nodes;key generation;encryption;antenna;propagation;measurement},   doi={10.23919/EuCAP.2017.7928251},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

In this paper, we present our preliminary findings of early detection of MCI in elderly who are living in the community, through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for continuous, unobtrusive sensing. Multi-modal sensors are placed in the residences of elderly, to monitor their Activities of Daily Living (ADL), as well as to detect signs of forgetfulness, which are considered symptoms of MCI.

However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;patient centric agent;privacy;PCA based architecture;continuous time patient monitoring architecture;real time patient monitoring architecture;continuous patient monitoring;block architecture;continuous remote patient monitoring;RPM architectures;RPM challenging;tier-based End to End architecture;healthcare;Internet of Things;IoT;Computer architecture;Medical services;Principal component analysis;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Blockchain;body area sensor network;healthcare;remote patient monitoring;patient centric agent;proof of work;streamed data;Internet of Things;dynamically generated session key;patient record encryption key},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846779},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Smart health care can be implemented at all levels, starting from temperature monitoring for babies to tracking vital signs in the elderly. The complexity and cost of implementation varies based on the required precision of the individual device, functionalities, and sophistication of the application for which they are used. Smart health care also falls under vertical areas such as very-large-scale integration, embedded system, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={452-457},   abstract={With the more and more serious population aging problem, the demand of long-term care is increasing. Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly.

We have performed complexity analysis for the proposed lightweight architectures, and the results show that the hardware complexity of the proposed superserial multiplier is reduced compared with that of regular serial multipliers. This has been also confirmed through our application-specific integrated circuit hardware- and time-equivalent estimations.

The design of QoS in WBAN is a challenging task due to several reasons such as lossy channel, resource-constraint nodes and priority-based services. The QoS provisioning mechanisms mostly focus on the MAC layer and do not extend easily across all platforms. We propose to integrate the QoS design into the application layer using the standard CoAP framework. CoAP architecture is a platform independent standard intended to be used in simple electronics devices such as Internet of Things (IoT). We introduce three CoAP features such as Caching, Confirmability and Multicast addressing.

Automatic or semi-automatic methods are especially useful with this technique, due to the high quantity of data, in the form of 4D images (3D space + time), to be analysed in each test. This survey describes approaches to fully automatic computer-aided detection/diagnosis of breast lesions with CE-MRI, with particular emphasis on computational intelligence techniques.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;cancer;image enhancement;image segmentation;medical image processing;skin;tumours;breast cancer lesions;imaging techniques;nonskin cancer;CE-MRI examination;fully automatic computer;contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging;breast tissue;Solid modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Breast cancer;Heuristic algorithms;Computed tomography},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.27},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, due to the limited resources available in such constrained devices, it is challenging to exploit expensive cryptographic operations in the conventional security protocols.

It improves the quality of medical services by allowing periodic patient diagnostics. As it collects and sends sensitive biomedical information, both content and contextual privacy requirements must be satisfied. Content privacy ensures the protection of patient information against inappropriate disclosure. Contextual privacy is about the context of the communication. Several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed. However, they only consider content privacy requirement. To fill this gap, we propose in this paper a new privacy preserving scheme adapted to e-Health systems, satisfying all privacy requirements, as well as communication security and authentication. Content privacy is based on cryptographic primitives. Contextual privacy relies on the onion routing concept, fake messages injection and a multicast strategy. To validate our proposal, a security and performance analysis are reported. The security analysis confirms its safety and proves its resistance to a set of security attacks. The performance analysis highlights the trade-off between privacy and efficiency.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;security of data;Internet of Things;periodic patient diagnostics;sensitive biomedical information;contextual privacy;patient information;privacy-preserving approaches;content privacy requirement;privacy requirements;eHealth systems;communication security;authentication;authentication;onion routing concept;fake messages injection;multicast strategy;security attacks;Privacy;Medical services;Public key;Sensors;Payloads;Internet of Things;Security and Privacy;Content privacy;Contextual privacy;e-Health;ns-3},   doi={10.1109/AICCSA.2017.75},   ISSN={2161-5330},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={32258-32285},   abstract={Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;parallel processing;protocols;quality of service;smart cities;smart cities;mobile cloud computing;future healthcare demands;network latency;next-generation healthcare;ubiquitous healthcare framework;edge computing;deep learning;high-performance computing;HPC;network traffic;network layers;data rates;data caching;application protocols;anomalous data;Big Data;UbeHealth system;personalized ubiquitous cloud computing;edge-enabled networked healthcare system;personalized healthcare;patient data analysis;reliability;Internet of Things;IoT;enhanced network quality of service;routing decisions;traffic flows;malicious traffic detection;Medical services;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Quality of service;Machine learning;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Cloudlets;deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile edge computing;mobile healthcare;preventive healthcare;traffic classification;traffic prediction;survey;fog computing;cloud computing;multimedia applications;smart cities},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846609},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Many types of unimodal biometric systems have been developed. However, these systems are only capable of providing lowto mid-range security features. Thus, for higher-security features, the combination of two or more unimodal biometrics (multiple modalities) is required. In this paper, we propose a multimodal biometric system for person recognition using face, fingerprint, and finger vein images. Addressing this problem, we propose an efficient matching algorithm that is based on secondary calculation of the Fisher vector and uses three biometric modalities: face, fingerprint, and finger vein. The three modalities are combined and fusion is performed at the feature level. Furthermore, based on the method of feature fusion, the paper studies the fake feature which appears in the practical scene. The liveness detection is append to the system, detect the picture is real or fake based on DCT, then remove the fake picture to reduce the influence of accuracy rate, and increase the robust of system. The experimental results showed that the designed framework can achieve an excellent recognition rate and provide higher security than a unimodal biometric-based system, which are very important for a IoMT platform.},   keywords={authorisation;biometrics (access control);discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;image matching;Internet of Things;Internet of Medical Things;matching algorithm;DCT;liveness detection;unimodal biometric-based system;biometric modalities;finger vein images;fingerprint;multimodal biometric system;unimodal biometric systems;access control systems;higher-security features;IoMT platform;biometrics identification system;multimodal feature-level fusion;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Veins;Fingers;Face;Face recognition;Multi-model fusion;fisher vector;liveness detection;personal identification;IoMT},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2815540},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Hardware-based authentication and encryption offer several advantages in these types of resource-constrained applications, including smaller footprints and lower energy consumption. Bitstring and key generation implemented with Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs can further reduce resource utilization for authentication and encryption operations and reduce overall system cost by eliminating on-chip non-volatile-memory (NVM). In this paper, we propose a dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) strategy for implementing both authentication and encryption using a PUF for bitstring and key generation on FPGAs as a means of optimizing the utilization of the limited area resources.

In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health.

 title={Collecting Data about the Way Dyslexic Children Write}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Internet Of Things (IoT) is one of the major topics in computer science. The connection of IoT to applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is common in order to propose practical solutions. Simultaneously, games are known to increase interest and motivation among students when they are designed with pedagogic intent. Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them. But as our application gathers information that are relevant for remediation, it is also a forward useful solution to doctors who are always busy and who might check the display of children without an actual meeting.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;Internet Of Things;wireless sensor networks;WSN;dyslexic children;medical care;IoT;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Sensors;Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Software;Games},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417598},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},   keywords={body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;healthcare;power consumption;statistical techniques;bandwidth consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;wireless human gait monitoring system;Decision support systems;Internet;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Body Area Networks},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},   keywords={cardiology;cardiovascular system;diseases;electroencephalography;Haar transforms;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;time series;individual physiological time series;biosignal processing system;Haar Transform;IoT application;Internet of Things;blood pressure;heart rate;EEG;chronic diseases;urgent diseases;cardiovascular disease;Time series analysis;Transforms;Correlation;Physiology;Medical services;Market research;Euclidean distance;time series;correlation;Haar wavelet;Haar transform;distance measure;clustering;healthcare;IoT},   doi={10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54},   ISSN={2471-7819},   month={Oct},}

IoT will have an important role in connecting almost everything (mobile devices, cameras, home appliances, healthcare devices, military equipments, ..., etc) to the Internet via different communication technologies such as Wi-Fi. This connection will have impact on many sectors of our life such as industry, economy, social life, and ICT sector. Moreover, there will be huge amounts of data (including financial and medical records for example) transmitted between those devices and the non-secure Internet. Some of these data might be very sensitive and their privacy and security must not be compromised. Here comes the need for Cryptographic systems to protect the vital data. There are many hardware and software implementations for the symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and RSA. And since we are talking about protecting physical devices connected to the Internet, we think that the hardware cryptosystems are more useful to be used in this case. In this paper, we introduce the IoT concept, applications, and challenges facing IoT.

The rapid development of IoT and vast expansion of wireless technologies unfold the new chances of growth in several domains such as, Education, Transportation, Agriculture, and especially in the Healthcare sector. Introducing the IoT through healthcare applications fetch several benefits, including cost savings through lowered hospital visiting costs, health care provider costs, transportation costs, human resource costs and the insurance costs. It leads to an added advantage of improved quality care in health care. However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT.

However, standards are highly complex and require a large amount of interpretation, deployments are currently scarce, and performance evaluations simplistic or speculative. In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications.

 title={Internet of Things for a Smart and Ubiquitous eHealth System}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={903-907},   abstract={Connected data has always been considered as a primary source to knowledge. Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly. Nevertheless, the enormous spread of Internet of Things for efficient and intelligent healthcare services holds quite inevitable. Rather it adds to the foundation notion of ubiquitous services by making available to everyone and everywhere. The new age eHealth facilities are expected to enable end-to-end monitoring systems even at remote scenarios, helping medical services reach the unreached.},   keywords={decision support systems;health care;Internet of Things;medical administrative data processing;patient monitoring;Internet of Things;smart eHealth system;ubiquitous eHealth system;healthcare technologies;patient data;patient treatment;healthcare personnel accessibility;mutual knowledge sharing;intelligent clinical decision support system;smart medical environment;end-to-end monitoring systems;Internet of things;Medical services;Medical diagnostic imaging;Decision support systems;Real-time systems;Context;Monitoring;cloud;eHealth;healthcare;internet of things;smart;ubiquitous},   doi={10.1109/CICN.2015.178},   ISSN={2472-7555},   month={Dec},}

The proposed framework is constructed on the basis of author's preceding studies [1-6] and combines IoT technology with the power line communication networks. The framework was constructed based on the scenarios which were created on the 3 layers among the 7-layers of OSI and then, a test bed was created to check the performance. The study showed that this expandable framework was successful in its design and implementation. In addition, the test bed experiment confirmed that the elements in the framework worked flexibly. Previous partial research findings in the preceding studies [1-6] were published in both domestic and foreign conferences or journals, where the feasibility of each research was proven.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={9464-9472},   abstract={Meeting application requirements under a tight power budget is of a primary importance to enable connected health internet of things applications. This paper considers using sparse representation and well-defined inequality indexes drawn from the theory of inequality to distinguish ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) from non-VEBs. Our approach involves designing a separate dictionary for each arrhythmia class using a set of labeled training QRS complexes. Sparse representation, based on the designed dictionaries of each new test QRS complex is then calculated. Following this, its class is predicted using the winner-takes-all principle by selecting the class with the highest inequality index. The experiments showed promising results ranging between 80% and 100% for the detection of VEBs considering the patient-specific approach, 80% using cross validation and 70% on unseen data using independent sets for training and testing, respectively. An efficient hardware implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is also presented. The results show that the proposed hardware implementation can classify a QRS complex in 69.3 ms that use only 0.934 W energy.},   keywords={diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;signal classification;sparse representation;arrhythmia class;multipliers algorithm;inequality indexes;health internet of things applications;QRS complexes;ventricular ectopic beats detection;Dictionaries;Indexes;Optimization;Hardware;Convex functions;Clustering algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Inequality indexes;dictionary learning;ADMM;arrhythmia;classification;connected health;QRS},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780190},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

IoT has made big contributions to data growth, requiring highly reliable data storage solutions. Storage area networks (SANs) are one of such solutions. To meet high reliability and availability requirements, SANs have to provide fault tolerance through redundancy to minimize or eliminate system downtime, thus preventing business discontinuity due to catastrophic events. Mesh is one of the common SAN topologies that have been applied to implement a fault tolerant SAN in practice. In this paper, failure behavior of a mesh SAN is modeled using a dynamic fault tree (DFT) in the case of perfect links, or a network graph in the case of imperfect links. Based on the constructed DFT or network graph model, reliability of the mesh SAN is evaluated using a binary decision diagram-based method. Results obtained from the case study can provide insights into the behavior of general mesh SAN systems, providing guidelines in the reliable design and operation of SANs.},   keywords={binary decision diagrams;computer network reliability;discrete Fourier transforms;fault tolerance;fault trees;graph theory;Internet;Internet of Things;storage area networks;fault tolerant SAN topologies;data storage solution;system downtime elimination;business discontinuity prevention;DFT;binary decision diagram-based method;financial services;smart grids;medical services;intelligent data sensors;IoT;mesh storage area networks;reliability modeling;general mesh SAN systems;network graph model;dynamic fault tree;Topology;Fault trees;Servers;Computer network reliability;Reliability theory;Decision making;Mesh networks;Storage area networks;Binary decision diagram (BDD);dynamic fault tree (DFT);Internet of Things (IoT);mesh topology;reliability;storage area network (SAN)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2749375},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative, sometimes revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications that can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implantable and wearable devices. We show that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power and mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers the gap in attenuation between 2.4 GHz RF and ultrasonic waves is still substantial, e.g., ultrasounds offer 70 dB less attenuation over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires much lower transmission power compared to 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability in tissues, e.g., 35 dBm lower over 12 cm for 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; Bit Error Rate (BEr) leading to lower energy per bit and longer device lifetime. Finally, we show experimentally that 2.4 GHz RF links are not functional at all above 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; up to 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.},   keywords={biomedical communication;biomedical ultrasonics;error statistics;Internet of Things;low-power electronics;prosthetics;ultrasonic transducers;low-power ultrasonic platform;wirelessly networked systems;implantable medical devices;sensors;actuators;revolutionary therapies;networked implantable devices;dielectric nature;human body;radio-frequency electromagnetic waves;software architecture;ultrasonic connectivity;wearable devices;ultrasonic waves;mm-sized components;ultrasonic transducers the gap;attenuation;IoMT platform;lower transmission power;longer device lifetime;ultrasonic links;intrabody communications;RF links;transmission power;Internet of Medical Things platform;frequency 2.4 GHz;noise figure 70.0 dB;size 10.0 cm;size 12.0 cm;size 20.0 cm;Acoustics;Radio frequency;Sensors;Implants;Hardware;Wireless communication;Field programmable gate arrays},   doi={10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057133},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Generated data are usually raw, requiring cloud resources for processing and decision-making operations to distill smartness. However, use of cloud resources raises serious design issues: limited bandwidth, insufficient energy, and security concerns. We propose a novel way out of this predicament by employing signal compression and machine learning inference on the IoT sensor node. Since on-sensor compression and inference drastically reduce the amount of data that need to be transmitted, we actually end up with a dramatic energy bonus relative to the traditional sense-and-transmit IoT sensor. We use a small part of this energy bonus to carry out cryptographic techniques to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

Activity monitoring is one of the most important services in the field of the elderly care service. In this paper, we proposed a wearable solution to provide an activity monitoring service on elders for caregivers. The system uses wireless signals to estimate calorie burned by the walking and localization. In addition, it also uses wireless motion sensors to recognize physical activity, such as drinking and restroom activity. Overall, the system can be divided into four parts: wearable device, gateway, cloud server, and caregiver's android application. The algorithms we proposed for drinking activity are Decision Tree (J48) and Random Forest (RF). While for restroom activity, we proposed supervised Reduced Error Pruning (REP) Tree and Variable Order Hidden Markov Model (VOHMM).

To realize the full potential of these services, fragmented and heterogeneous data that is generated by different segments of the system need to be consolidated in order to support high-quality processes. This paper proposes a tiered data integration scheme for mHealth systems that works on the schema, entity, and event levels. The proposed scheme incorporates an algorithm that merges and ranks sensor streams for schema integration and event identification, and performs contextual record registration and deduplication for entity resolution. We tested the proposed integration scheme on two sets of sensor-based mHealth data related to human activity recognition.

  year={2018},   volume={65},   number={4},   pages={809-820},   abstract={Goal: The two dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) possesses many important applications in bioengineering but suffers from long acquisition duration. Non-uniform sampling has been applied to the spatiotemporally encoded ultrafast MRS, but results in missing data in the hybrid time and frequency plane. An approach is proposed to recover this missing signal, of which enables high quality spectrum reconstruction. M ethods: The natural exponential characteristic of MRS is exploited to recover the hybrid time and frequency signal. The reconstruction issue is formulated as a low rank enhanced Hankel matrix completion problem and is solved by a fast numerical algorithm. Results: Experiments on synthetic and real MRS data show that the proposed method provides faithful spectrum reconstruction, and outperforms the state-of-the-art compressed sensing approach on recovering low-intensity spectral peaks and robustness to different sampling patterns. C onclusion: The exponential signal property serves as an useful tool to model the time-domain MRS signals and even allows missing data recovery. The proposed method has been shown to reconstruct high quality MRS spectra from non-uniformly sampled data in the hybrid time and frequency plane. Significance: Low-intensity signal reconstruction is generally challenging in biological MRS and we provide a solution to this problem. The proposed method may be extended to recover signals that generally can be modeled as a sum of exponential functions in biomedical engineering applications, e.g., signal enhancement, feature extraction, and fast sampling.},   keywords={biomedical MRI;compressed sensing;feature extraction;Hankel matrices;image reconstruction;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;matrix algebra;medical image processing;signal sampling;low-intensity spectral peaks;exponential signal property;time-domain MRS signals;high quality MRS spectra;fast magnetic resonance spectroscopy;dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy;ultrafast MRS;high quality spectrum reconstruction;Hankel matrix completion problem;fast numerical algorithm;low-intensity signal enhancement;low-intensity signal enhancement;low rank enhanced matrix recovery;spatiotemporally encoded ultrafast MRS;Two dimensional displays;Time-domain analysis;Time-frequency analysis;Magnetic resonance;Fourier transforms;Spectroscopy;Exponential signal;fast sampling;low rank;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;reconstruction},   doi={10.1109/TBME.2017.2719709},   ISSN={0018-9294},   month={April},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={35801-35808},   abstract={In this paper, a wireless implantable sensor prototype with subcutaneous solar energy harvesting is proposed. To evaluate the performance of a flexible solar panel under skin, ex-vivo experiments are conducted under natural sunlight and artificial light sources. The results show that the solar panel covered by a 3 mm thick porcine flap can output tens of microWatts to a few milliWatts depending on the light conditions. The subcutaneous solar energy harvester is tested on different body parts, which suggests the optimal position for the harvester to implant is between neck and shoulder. A wireless implantable system powered by the subcutaneous energy harvester is presented, which consists of a power management circuit, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth low energy module. An application is developed for data visualization on mobile devices, which can be a gateway for future IoT-based healthcare applications. The entire device is embedded in a transparent silicone housing (38 mm × 32 mm × 4 mm), including a 7 mAh rechargeable battery for energy storage. The average power consumption of the implants is about 30 μW in a 10 min operation cycle. With the subcutaneous solar energy harvester, the self-powered operation of the implantable sensor prototype is demonstrated by long-term experimental results.

For the emergency communication platforms and services to cope with the cataclysmic changes that the 5G era is bringing along, a swift change is required in terms of incorporating mission critical IoT communications, massive machine-type communication and Gigabit mobile connectivity.

In today's Internet of Things (IoT) world, there has been numerous wearable technological devices to monitor/measure different health attributes. With the increasing number of attributes and wearables, it becomes unclear to individuals which ones they should be using. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them. Lastly, we use a mathematical optimization model that we developed to recommend the optimal wearable devices and IoT solutions for the individual. Thus, our solution enables proactive health monitoring and can thus provide a significant human benefit.},   keywords={data mining;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;medical computing;recommender systems;text analysis;recommendation system;proactive health monitoring;Internet of Things;IoT world;wearable technological devices;health attributes;personalized advised wearables;recommendation engine;unstructured medical history;text mining;structured demographic attributes;machine learning classification model;eventual diseases;mathematical optimization model;optimal wearable devices;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diseases;Wearable sensors;Temperature sensors;IoT;Healthcare;Monitoring;Wearable Technologies;Analytics;Text Mining;Optimization},   doi={10.1109/AIMS.2017.11},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Log compression is being used to compress the data to 8 bits. Since log compression is a non linear compression it is very difficult to trace the original characteristics of the signal. In this paper various global and local compression techniques were studied as a replacement for log compression so that the dynamic range of image can be retrieved if the physician has a better monitor for display, and also ensure minimum error in the retrieved signal leading to minimum error in retrieved image. From the results it is observed that Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of wavelet compressed image is 1.02 times more and that of gamma compressed image is 2.24 times more than log compressed image. Gamma based compression can be preferred to log and wavelet based compression, as it gives good quality image when compared with other compression techniques, but cannot be used to retrieve the statistical properties when expanded, since these statistical properties are helpful for doctors for better analysis.

Moreover, with the help of software defined networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any trusted third party. Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching.

With the continuous development of the IoT, more and more “things” will be able to access to the IoT. Considering a large number of heterogeneous “things”, how to provide a unified access mechanism to the IoT is a fundamental and key issue. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT access architecture based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) and system on chip (SoC), which can provide a unified access to the IoT for a wide variety of low-speed and high-speed devices with associated extendibility and configurability. We have adopted IEEE1451.2 standard for this design and applied the proposed design to vehicle monitoring system. The results indicate that the system can provide good performance in practical application.},   keywords={electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;system-on-chip;IoT access architecture;Internet of Things;traffic monitoring;medical treatment;industrial application;field programmable gate array;FPGA;system on chip;SoC;IEEE 1451.2 standard;vehicle monitoring system;FPGA;IoT;SoC;Vehicle Monitoring},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845396},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Tolerating Sensitive-Leakage With Larger Plaintext-Space and Higher Leakage-Rate in Privacy-Aware Internet-of-Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={33859-33870},   abstract={When executing a program or storing data in a medical Internet of Things (mIoT) system, physical side-channels analysis, such as recent-timing, cold-reboot, and virtual-machine attacks, might obtain partial information about internal sensitive medical data/states in memory that the attacker can gain partial privacy information. Leakage-resilient cryptography has led to better implementation of many cryptographic primitives that can be proven secure against attackers who can obtain limited sensitive information about private keys, randomness, and other internal states, and therefore prevents from breaking the security. In this paper, to tolerate the sensitive information leakage in mIoT, we first present a leakage-resilient public-key encryption mechanism that is semantically secure against adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks in the presence of key leakage under standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our construction employs a special universal hashing in multiplicative group to provide an efficient strong extractor, and a key derivation function to derive one or more symmetric keys from a single value. Also, the plaintext space of the scheme is extended to the full domain field of group so as to provide a larger space for the message. We emphasis that our scheme can be deployed in mIoT since the limited power and energy budgets, the communication and computation cost, and the leakage attack are taken into account. Using the first scheme as a building block, we also give a protocol construction to achieve the security resilient to randomness leakage and key leakage. Our schemes feature with a shorter key size and a larger plaintext space. Concretely, the private-key contains only four elements in the finite field, and the allowable key-leakage rate is 25%, which provides a higher leakage rate than Naor Segev (leakage rate is 16.7%) and its variants. It is worth highlighting of the construction resilient to both key leakage and randomness leakage, simultaneously, and is flexible to deploy in easy-to-attack outdoor nodes such as in medical IoT and smart grids, since in these nodes the private keys and randomness are either stored or generated in outdoor privacy-aware environments.},   keywords={computer network security;data privacy;Internet of Things;medical computing;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;virtual machines;partial privacy information;leakage-resilient cryptography;private keys;sensitive information leakage;leakage-resilient public-key encryption mechanism;adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks;key derivation function;symmetric keys;leakage attack;randomness leakage;easy-to-attack outdoor nodes;key-leakage rate;computation cost;communication cost;limited energy budget;limited power budget;universal hashing;standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption;cryptographic primitives;internal sensitive medical states;internal sensitive medical data;virtual-machine attack;cold-reboot attack;recent-timing attack;physical side-channels analysis;mIoT system;medical Internet-of-Things system;leakage-rate privacy-aware Internet-of-Things;plaintext-space;sensitive-leakage;plaintext space;key size;Encryption;Internet of Things;Random access memory;Public key;Protocols;Sensitive information leakage;key entropy;randomness leakage;leakage rate;medical Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2842713},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-10},   abstract={We build upon the idea of Physiological Value Based Security schemes as a means of securing body sensor networks (BSN). Such schemes provide a secure means for sensors in a BSN to communicate with one another, as long as they can measure the same underlying physiological signal. This avoids the use of pre-distributed keys and allows re-keying to be done easily. Such techniques require identifying signals and encoding methods that can be used in the scheme. Hence we first evaluate step interval as our physiological signal, using existing modular encoding method and our proposed learned partitioning function as the encoding methods. We show that both of these are usable with the scheme and identify a suitable parametrisation. We then go on to evaluate arterial blood pressure using our proposed learned mean FFT coefficients method. We demonstrate that with the correct parameters this could also be used in the scheme. This further improves the usability of PVS schemes, by identify two more signals that could be used, as well as two encoding methods that may also be useful for other signals.},   keywords={blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;body sensor networks;fast Fourier transforms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wireless sensor networks;arterial pressure;PVS schemes;body sensor networks;encoding methods;arterial blood pressure;learned mean FFT coefficients method;physiological signal;modular encoding method;security;medical;sensor;physiological;network},   doi={10.1049/cp.2018.0036},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2011},   volume={},   number={},   pages={192-195},   abstract={The internet of things (IOT) has the same security requirements as traditional network, but according to the characteristics of its own, the internet of things also has some specific security features. Among these features, the flexibility of the network requires nodes to apply corresponding measures when scene changes. For example, in emergency situations (e.g. an accident occurs, and a doctor is needed), the location of the user is available, while under normal circumstances, the user's location information is confidential. This paper is in the background of the above scene to present an identity based system for personal location in emergency situations. The proposed system consists of registration subsystem, user authentication subsystem, policy subsystem and client subsystem. The system confirms the identity of the user through the user authentication subsystem and gets the level of the emergency through the policy subsystem. Then it can make sure that user's location information can be accessed only by some authorized user, and only when necessary. The proposed system strengthens the protection of the user's privacy while providing the location of the user, and prevents the disclosure of the users' information.},   keywords={authorisation;data privacy;emergency services;Internet;message authentication;identity-based personal location system;protected privacy;IOT;Internet of things;security requirement;security features;network flexibility;emergency situation;registration subsystem;user authentication subsystem;policy subsystem;client subsystem;user identity;authorized user;user privacy protection;user location;virtual identity;Privacy;Authentication;Servers;Accidents;Internet;Medical services;emergency situations;virtual identity;internet of things (IOT);privacy;security},   doi={10.1109/ICBNMT.2011.6155923},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

These benefits are discussed from the perspective of the medical (mobile health) and business marketing (right time experiences) disciplines. Moreover, other business benefits from the use of these technologies have also been discussed in this paper.

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},   keywords={cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones;flexible wound assessment system;diabetic patient;Android smartphone;diabetic ulcers;wound assessment;visual examination;wound size;healing status;caregivers;high-resolution digital camera;chronic ulcer image analysis;wound image analysis system;Android App;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;skin color;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;Wounds;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Diabetes;Algorithm design and analysis;Smart phones;Patients with diabetes;Android Smartphones;Android App;RGB color evaluation;Mean Shift Algorithm},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

We present an IoT based smart edge system for remote health monitoring, in which wearable vital sensors transmit data into two novel software engines, namely Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis (RASPRO) and Criticality Measure Index (CMI) alerts, both of which we have implemented in the IoT smart edge. RASPRO transforms voluminous sensor data into clinically meaningful summaries called Personalized Health Motifs (PHMs). The CMI alerts engine computes an aggregate criticality score. Our IoT smart edge employs a risk-stratified protocol consisting of rapid guaranteed push of alerts &amp; PHMs directly to the physicians, and best effort pull of detailed data-on-demand (DD-on-D) through the cloud. We have carried out both clinical validation and performance evaluation of our smart edge system. The clinical validation on 183 patients demonstrated that the IoT smart edge is highly effective in remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of cardiac conditions, as quantified by three measures, precision (0.87), recall (0.83), and F1-score (0.85). Furthermore, performance evaluation showed significant reductions in the bandwidth (98%) and energy (90%), thereby making it suitable for emerging narrow-band IoT networks. In the deployment of our system in the cardiology institute of our University hospital, we observed that our IoT smart edge helped to increase the availability of physicians by 59%.

 title={Enhancing Adherence to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia through Machine and Social Persuasion}, 
  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={750-757},   abstract={Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a treatment that focuses on psychological and behavioral factors. Although the CBT-I has proven efficacy, yet 32%-V89% of patients fail to consistently follow recommendations. The critical challenge of CBT-I is how to enhance the adherence of patients to therapy. In this study, we propose a persuasion method which integrates machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion for enhancing adherence, and we design a mobile application Win-Win ASleep (WWaS). We performed a 6-week study to evaluate the usability of WWaS on enhancing behavioral and recording adherence in comparison to a paper-based diary. Results show that machine-generated persuasion and socially-generated persuasion enhanced the adherence of patients in different manner, and WWaS assists users keeping a sleep diary accurate and complete. These higher quality records of sleep diary benefits the therapy. We also discuss strategies and provide recommendations for designing similar mobile applications to promote healthy behavior.},   keywords={behavioural sciences computing;cognition;social sciences computing;cognitive behavioral therapy;insomnia;social persuasion method;machine generated persuasion;socially generated persuasion;mobile application;Win-Win ASleep;usability;recording adherence;WWaS assists;sleep diary accurate;sleep diary benefits;healthy behavior;Medical treatment;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Reliability;Schedules;Educational institutions;Psychology;Insomnia;Cognitive Behavior Therapy;Persuasion;Adherence;Mobile phone},   doi={10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.135},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

 title={Assessment of the Suitability of Fog Computing in the Context of Internet of Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={1},   pages={46-59},   abstract={This work performs a rigorous, comparative analysis of the fog computing paradigm and the conventional cloud computing paradigm in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), by mathematically formulating the parameters and characteristics of fog computing-one of the first attempts of its kind. With the rapid increase in the number of Internet-connected devices, the increased demand of real-time, low-latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional cloud computing framework. Also, our irreplaceable dependency on cloud computing demands the cloud data centers (DCs) always to be up and running which exhausts huge amount of power and yield tons of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. In this work, we assess the applicability of the newly proposed fog computing paradigm to serve the demands of the latency-sensitive applications in the context of IoT. We model the fog computing paradigm by mathematically characterizing the fog computing network in terms of power consumption, service latency, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission, and cost, and evaluating its performance for an environment with high number of Internet-connected devices demanding real-time service. A case study is performed with traffic generated from the 100 highest populated cities being served by eight geographically distributed DCs. Results show that as the number of applications demanding real-time service increases, the fog computing paradigm outperforms traditional cloud computing. For an environment with 50 percent applications requesting for instantaneous, real-time services, the overall service latency for fog computing is noted to decrease by 50.09 percent. However, it is mentionworthy that for an environment with less percentage of applications demanding for low-latency services, fog computing is observed to be an overhead compared to the traditional cloud computing. Therefore, the work shows that in the context of IoT, with high number of latency-sensitive applications fog computing outperforms cloud computing.},   keywords={air pollution;carbon compounds;cloud computing;computer centres;Internet of Things;synchronisation;telecommunication power management;Internet-connected devices;fog computing network;latency-sensitive applications;cloud computing paradigm;Internet of Things;cloud data centers;IoT;carbon dioxide gas;power consumption;CO<sub>2</sub>;Cloud computing;Real-time systems;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Logic gates;Context;Performance evaluation;Fog computing;cloud computing;Internet of things (IoT);service latency;power consumption;carbon-dioxide emission},   doi={10.1109/TCC.2015.2485206},   ISSN={2168-7161},   month={Jan},}

 title={Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier for Behavior Analysis to Estimate Parkinson’s Disease Severity Using Smartphones}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={36825-36833},   abstract={Although the preclinical detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been explored, a practical, inexpensive, and overall screening diagnosis has yet to be made available. However, due to the large variability and complexity in progress of PD and the difficulties in gathering a single time-point measurement of a single sign, the goal of precision treatment and assessment severity would be impossible to achieve. Hence, the repeated monitoring and tracking of individuals during their daily living activities at different times would also be of great importance for treating this chronic disease. We propose a deep multi-layer perceptron (DMLP) classifier for behavior analysis to estimate the progression of PD using smartphones. This paper aims to identify severity in PD patients' actions by analyzing their speech and movement patterns, as measured with a smartphone accelerometer in their pocket at different times of the day. Popular machine learning classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, M5P, and DMLP, are applied on one dataset from the University of California Irvine and another dataset collected by the authors to classify each patient as being Parkinson positive or negative. We further measure the success of each method for their ability to correctly classify the patients into one of these categories. Of the experimental models, it is demonstrated that DMLP performs the best in both datasets.},   keywords={accelerometers;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;regression analysis;smart phones;practical screening diagnosis;chronic disease;DMLP;PD patients;smartphone accelerometer;Parkinsons disease;deep multilayer perceptron classifier;machine learning classification algorithm;logistic regression;random forest;k-nearest neighbor;California Irvine;Smart phones;Diseases;Legged locomotion;Monitoring;Biomedical measurement;Sensors;Accelerometers;Parkinson’s disease;behavior analysis;DMLP;classification},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2851382},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In contrast, the use of wireless sensors to capture physiological data from patients for long term health monitoring is becoming increasingly popular although some previous studies recorded complaints from users about discomfort when wearing these. In addition, these systems can sometimes suffer from interference from existing Wi-Fi traffic. Therefore, a sensor system that is both comfortable to use and does not encounter interference with existing wireless traffic is required. This paper presents a system design that includes a probe, sensor, radio, and receiver for a long term heart rate monitoring in a senior center. This system has been deployed in a senior center since May 2012, and 63 seniors have used this system in this period. The senior center has its own wireless network, and no changes were made to this.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-11},   abstract={An ultra-low power electrocardiogram (ECG) processing architecture with an adequate level of accuracy is a necessity for Internet of Things (IoT) medical wearable devices. This paper presents a novel real-time QRS detector and an ECG compression architecture for IoT healthcare devices. An absolute-value curve length transform (A-CLT) is proposed that effectively enhances the QRS complex detection with minimized hardware resources. The proposed architecture requires adders, shifters, and comparators only, and removes the need for any multipliers. QRS detection was accomplished by using adaptive thresholds in the A-CLT transformed ECG signal, and achieved a sensitivity of 99.37% and the predictivity of 99.38% when validated using Physionet ECG database. Furthermore, a lossless compression technique was incorporated into the proposed architecture that uses the ECG signal first derivative and entropy encoding. An average compression ratio of 2.05 was achieved when evaluated using MIT-BIH database. The proposed QRS detection architecture deals with almost all the ECG signal artifacts, such as low-frequency noise, baseline drift, and high-frequency interference with minimum hardware resources. The proposed QRS architecture was synthesized using 65-nm low-power process using standard-cell-based flow. The power consumption of the design was 6.5 nW while operating at a supply of 1 V and a frequency of 250 Hz. Moreover, the system could benefit from duty-cycling.},   keywords={Electrocardiography;Computer architecture;Transmitters;Medical services;Transforms;Low-power electronics;Power demand;Elecrocardiogram;QRS complex;computational complexity;absolute value curve length transform;compression.},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2018.2867746},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={},}

The paper discussed and analyzed metrics for the handover mechanism based on Wi-Fi. In addition, a complete remote real-time health monitoring IoT system was implemented for experiments.

When the body is deprived of essential nutrients, it can lead to serious disease and organ deterioration which can cause serious health issues in adulthood. Automated monitoring of the nutritional content of food provided to infants, not only at home but also in daycare facilities, is essential for their healthy development. To address this challenge, this paper presents a new Internet of Things (IoT)-based fully automated nutrition monitoring system, called Smart-Log, to advance the state-of-art in smart healthcare. For the realization of Smart-Log, a novel 5-layer perceptron neural network and a Bayesian network-based accurate meal prediction algorithm are presented in this paper. Smart-Log is prototyped as a consumer electronics product which consists of WiFi enabled sensors for food nutrition quantification, and a smart phone application that collects nutritional facts of the food ingredients.

  year={2016},   volume={46},   number={10},   pages={2372-2385},   abstract={Clustering of big data has received much attention recently. In this paper, we present a new clusiVAT algorithm and compare it with four other popular data clustering algorithms. Three of the four comparison methods are based on the well known, classical batch k-means model. Specifically, we use k-means, single pass k-means, online k-means, and clustering using representatives (CURE) for numerical comparisons. clusiVAT is based on sampling the data, imaging the reordered distance matrix to estimate the number of clusters in the data visually, clustering the samples using a relative of single linkage (SL), and then noniteratively extending the labels to the rest of the data-set using the nearest prototype rule. Previous work has established that clusiVAT produces true SL clusters in compact-separated data. We have performed experiments to show that k-means and its modified algorithms suffer from initialization issues that cause many failures. On the other hand, clusiVAT needs no initialization, and almost always finds partitions that accurately match ground truth labels in labeled data. CURE also finds SL type partitions but is much slower than the other four algorithms. In our experiments, clusiVAT proves to be the fastest and most accurate of the five algorithms; e.g., it recovers 97% of the ground truth labels in the real world KDD-99 cup data (4292637 samples in 41 dimensions) in 76 s.},   keywords={Big Data;pattern clustering;visual databases;hybrid approach;Big Data;clusiVAT algorithm;data clustering algorithm;batch k-means model;single-pass k-means;online-k-means;clustering-using representatives;CURE;data sampling;distance matrix;single linkage;noniterative data labelling;nearest prototype rule;ground truth labels;SL type partitioning;real world KDD-99 cup data;Clustering algorithms;Big data;Partitioning algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Image edge detection;Cybernetics;Indexes;Big data cluster analysis;cluster tendency assessment;data analytics;Internet of things;single linkage},   doi={10.1109/TCYB.2015.2477416},   ISSN={2168-2267},   month={Oct},}

Blood sugar level of body is a very important factor for health and it should be maintain within the desired level or else this would result in complications and often serious damage to the body. Therefore treatment must be provided in case of high or low blood sugar level. In case of high blood sugar level, insulin must be injected and in case of low blood sugar level we should inject glucagon into the body. This paper is concerned on advanced method of simulation that can be used to implement a real insulin and glucagon pump that can work in real time to prevent the fatal effects of diabetes on body. This system also covers all the safety critical system aspect required to build a system that has a direct effect on human life. To provide better insulin and glucagon management and to reduce the need for human supervision, we have implement a control algorithm for the insulin and glucagon pump to automate the delivery process. The control algorithm adapts the glucose metabolic rate and determine the appropriate amount of insulin or glucagon to be delivered into the body. Method that is followed is effective and efficient in maintaining the blood sugar level. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system is very easy and user friendly that makes it easier for the patient and doctor to use.

 title={A Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect allergies and Adverse Drugs Reactions based on internet of things}, 
  year={2010},   volume={},   number={},   pages={809-812},   abstract={The incidence of serious and fatal Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR) and harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients in worldwide hospitals is extremely high. Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.},   keywords={drug delivery systems;Internet;knowledge based systems;medical information systems;pharmaceutical intelligent information system;Internet-of-things;adverse drugs reaction;allergy interactions;near field communication;electronic health record;active ingredients;nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance;Pharmaceuticals;Intelligent systems;Information systems;Drugs;Internet;Hospitals;Artificial intelligence;Costs;Knowledge based systems;Cellular phones;Internet of things;Ambient Assisted Living;Ontology;NFC;Barcode;Rule-Based System},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470547},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

This gear is a wearable glove device which can be used in various work spaces where power tools are being constantly used. This proposed system is built around a micro-processor acting as the central server, while many sensors are interfaced with microcontrollers, which act as the link for data transmission and perform various tasks. One of the microcontrollers acts as the master, which controls the other microcontrollers attached to various sensors. The master contains an LCD screen and few buttons, which can control the menu being shown on the screen. This can control the other sensors, and read the data in real time. The gloves contain safety features so that the workers are unable to use any dangerous power tools without wearing proper equipment. The glove will act as a security measure in such a way that each tool will have restricted access, according to the level of expertise of the worker. The glove can also restrict the access to the tools which are being used actively during a particular time-frame. The entire data is actively logged by the central server and various other sensors such as heat sensor, temperature sensor and vibration sensors can be attached and monitored by the master glove. The system also has an extra capability of analyzing tone of the workers so that whenever the user gets hurt and shouts in pain, the analysis function can classify the pain and call for medical help accordingly. A simple sweep based camera module is used alongside the central server to record and live-stream the captured video whenever any power tool is switched On.

By learning data from several mobile sensors, we detect nearness of the human body to a mobile device in a three-dimensional space with no physical contact with the device for non-invasive health diagnostics. We show that the human body generates wave patterns that interact with other naturally occurring ambient signals that could be measured by mobile sensors, such as, temperature, humidity, magnetic field, acceleration, gravity, and light. This interaction consequentially alters the patterns of the naturally occurring signals, and thus, exhibits characteristics that could be learned to predict the nearness of the human body to a mobile device, hence provide diagnostic information for medical practitioners.

In m-Healthcare, users' smartphones serve as bridges connecting their WBSNs and the healthcare center (HCC), i.e., send users' personal health information (PHI) collected by WBSNs to the HCC and receive the feedback. However, users' smartphones are not always available (e.g., left at home or out of power), resulting in an unexpected interruption of medical services sometimes, which are not considered in most existing schemes for m-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving agent data transmission scheme for m-healthcare in opportunistic social networks on condition that the smartphone is not available. By using the proposed protocol, we can provide uninterrupted healthcare while keeping the user's identity and PHI private during the agent transmitting of PHI.

It promises building better trust, transparency, and integrity without a third-party and the risk of censorship. These remarkable advantages do however come at a price. The blockchain ecosystem is riddled with human-centric and economical issues for its participants, leading to unintended consequences in decentralized networks. Gamified software engineering is a growing field that in particular taps into gamification technology, the application of game mechanics in non-game contexts, to address human-related concerns. There are currently no studies around blockchain that have been identified to have a clear view of existing research and solutions for utilizing the gamification in the emerging blockchain systems.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={139-148},   abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) is the network of physical devices which is embedded with the sensors to detect signals, software and actuators to take required action(s), electronics and network connectivity to collect and exchange data with other connected devices. These devices are also called smart devices. They are mostly connected remotely and can even send data to cloud. The concept of IoT can be implemented at homes, business, educational centers, medical fields and national security. This paper has implemented the concept of Internet of Things in schools or university classrooms where the attendance system is automated. With the help of a database, a student teacher interaction portal and physical devices, the paper aims to make an education institute smarter. In addition, our research also verifies the presence of a human being sitting on a chair using personal identification. The verification of the seat occupancy by a given individual can be confirmed from any part of the world at any given instance as the data is stored in cloud at all times. Sitting is the most prevalent conduct of human body in everyday life. People spend a lot of time sitting in a school chair, automobile seat or lounge chair in a day. It has been observed that as a result of some everyday activity or poor sitting postures can cause pains and other common complications for people like Endometriosis, Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction, Degenerative Disc Disease and more. This paper aims to mitigate such issues, and in order to circumvent the adverse effects of improper sitting behavior. The smart chair will also try to promote a healthy lifestyle of the students by measuring the student sitting postures and suggesting to maintain a good healthy posture. The usability of the device can be improved by investing in powerful and more accurate sensors, smaller micro devices and better servers. Consequently, these improvements will help in reducing the overall size of the device; the device will be more robust and accurate with low failure rate and long term stability.},   keywords={cloud computing;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;ergonomics;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;portals;seats;network connectivity;connected devices;smart devices;educational centers;national security;schools;university classrooms;attendance system;student teacher interaction portal;physical devices;education institute;seat occupancy;human body;time sitting;school chair;automobile seat;improper sitting behavior;smart chair;student sitting postures;smaller microdevices;Internet of Things;software;actuators;sitting postures;IoT;cloud;personal identification;seat occupancy verification;Radiofrequency identification;Temperature sensors;Servers;Microcontrollers;Databases;Temperature measurement;Smart Chair;Internet of Things (IoT);Radio-Frequency Identification;Posture;Attendance},   doi={10.1109/ICICI.2017.8365324},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In China, people have been using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to treat diseases for thousands of years. Doctors combine patient symptoms with TCM theory to devise formulae composed of several traditional medicines. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining popularity in the TCM domain. Consequently, a large number of TCM formulae with different therapeutic effects have been accumulated in IoMT. Therefore, we presented PWFP, which is an efficient methodology for extracting the top-K weighted frequent patterns for IoMT. PWFP guarantees efficient mining performance by estimating the minimum weighted support threshold value. Furthermore, PWFP can be applied in the efficacy-based analysis of these TCM formulae. This study conducted several experiments on both general datasets and TCM formulae for glomerulonephritis stored in IoMT. The rankings of the patterns mined from the prescriptions displayed a good rise in clinical efficacy. Doctors can use these top-k effective patterns as new drug and medicine combination candidates when they conduct drug discovery research and perform clinical medicine selection.},   keywords={Itemsets;Data mining;Diseases;Internet of Things;Drugs;Chinese medicinal formulae;curative effect;Internet of Medical Things;top-K weighted frequent patterns},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873677},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence. This paper presents the results of applying models to real clinical data. Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14).

Indicatively, real-time diagnosis of medical issues, telemedicine, remote monitoring of patients, as well as computer-assisted smart transportation in case of emergencies, are anticipated as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) that can execute several applications of different criticality, thus necessitating mission-critical and non-critical peripheral components. Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system.

From the assisted living perspective, this emerging concept will enable new communication connectivity routes between elderly disabled patient and care services through innovative networking architectures in AAL environments. M-health is defined as "mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care" [1]. This evolutionary concept provides both mobility and 'always connected' functionalities for different healthcare applications. In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services. In this paper we will present a general m-IoT architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology for measurement of body temperature as an example for healthcare application.},   keywords={4G mobile communication;health care;Internet;IP networks;mobile computing;personal area networks;temperature measurement;Internet of M-health things;sensing device;intelligent identification;intelligent management;heterogeneous connectivity environment;communication connectivity;elderly disabled patient care service;innovative networking architecture;AAL environment;mobile computing;medical sensor;evolutionary concept;healthcare connectivity paradigm;IP-based communication technology interconnection;4G network;Internet based healthcare service;m-IoT architecture;6LoWPAN technology;body temperature measurement;m-health;Internet of Things;chronic disease management;Wireless Sensor Network},   doi={10.1049/ic.2011.0036},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The past few years have seen some great medical innovations which are helping cure and prevent diseases which were earlier thought incurable. Despite such huge improvements, many of the engineering innovations are yet to be realized to its full potential in the medical industry. The field of assistive technologies for the visually impaired has been such a realm. Assistive technologies have been there for many years but the scope and application of these technologies have been very limited. The recent advances in the computer vision and inertial navigation systems can be easily employed in this field to give much more control to the visually impaired. The advent of low cost IMU's and GPS has led to huge advancements in these areas. This paper discusses how these assistive technologies can be employed to benefit some of the less privileged section of the society.},   keywords={computer vision;handicapped aids;computer vision;sensor technologies;assistive technologies;medical industry;medical innovations;engineering innovations;inertial navigation systems;IMU;GPS;Navigation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetometers;Biomedical imaging;Industries;Acoustics;Cameras;Assistive technologies;GPS;IMU;Image Processing},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380444},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={Fault tolerance (FT) is essential in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, in particular in the domains such as medical devices and automotive systems where a single fault in the system can lead to serious consequences. Non-volatile memory (NVM), on the other hand, is commonly used to improve system reliability due to its unique properties to retain data even if the power supply is lost. However, one of the most important drawbacks of NVM is that it imposes significant overhead regarding timing and energy. In this paper, we have proposed a unique technique with the use of NVM to create FT application specific architecture with almost no timing overhead and low energy overhead. We address the implementation of applications that are specified using synchronous data flow model of computation. We combine the use of NVM and classical CMOS transistors so that NVM judiciously stores selected complete states of the pertinent program. It allows the program to resume from the saved state in NVM when faults occur. The frequency of the state selection can be flexibly adjusted for an arbitrarily specified FT timing/energy overhead. Moreover, to find an optimal state selection (with low overhead), we have applied an improved min-cut max-flow algorithm. On a variety of typical benchmarks, the simulation results indicate that our approach incurs only a small overhead over lower bounds. It is also generic in a sense that it can be applied to a wide spectrum of underlying IoT architectures and computational models.},   keywords={CMOS memory circuits;energy conservation;fault tolerance;Internet of Things;minimax techniques;random-access storage;IoT architectures;mincut maxflow algorithm;CMOS transistors;synchronous data flow model;FT;NVM;nonvolatile memory;Internet of Things;energy-efficient fault tolerance},   doi={10.1145/2966986.2967034},   ISSN={1558-2434},   month={Nov},}

Towards this and aligned with the technology acceptance model, perceived ease of use is considered as a primary determinant affecting attitude towards ICT use. Therefore, contemporary mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, smart Tvs, etc.) can play essential role as means of delivering serious games.

Based on heart beat we can predict whether a person is in Stress or not. Stress is one of the main factors that are affecting millions of lives. Thus, it is important to inform the person about his unhealthy life style and even alarm him/her before any acute condition occurs. To detect the stress beforehand we have used heart beat rate as one of the parameters. Internet of Things (IoT) along with Machine Learning (ML) is used to alarm the situation when the person is in real risk. ML is used to predict the condition of the patient and IoT is used to communicate the patience about his/her acute stress condition.},   keywords={cardiology;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;machine learning;IoT;stress detection;stress prediction;cardiac surgeon;heart rate;person heart beat;Internet of Things;ML;acute stress condition;unhealthy life style;Stress;Servers;Support vector machines;Heart beat;Training;Logistics;Stress;heart beat rate;IoT;ML},   doi={10.1109/ICCSA.2017.8000018},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

  year={2018},   volume={37},   number={1},   pages={7-20},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a pervasive presence of interconnected and uniquely identifiable physical devices. These devices' goal is to gather data and drive actions in order to improve productivity, and ultimately reduce or eliminate reliance on human intervention for data acquisition, interpretation, and use. The proliferation of these connected low-power devices will result in a data explosion that will significantly increase data transmission costs with respect to energy consumption and latency. Edge computing reduces these costs by performing computations at the edge nodes, prior to data transmission, to interpret and/or utilize the data. While much research has focused on the IoT's connected nature and communication challenges, the challenges of IoT embedded computing with respect to device microprocessors has received much less attention. This paper explores IoT applications' execution characteristics from a microarchitectural perspective and the microarchitectural characteristics that will enable efficient and effective edge computing. To tractably represent a wide variety of next-generation IoT applications, we present a broad IoT application classification methodology based on application functions, to enable quicker workload characterizations for IoT microprocessors. We then survey and discuss potential microarchitectural optimizations and computing paradigms that will enable the design of right-provisioned microprocessors that are efficient, configurable, extensible, and scalable.

A novel wearable glove system for tremor quantification during DBS is presented. Rest, postural and action tremor assessment tasks are chosen as the feedback to the DBS treatment. Each tremor assessment task lasts for 10 seconds. A total of 5 patients with tremor were tested with the first prototype. Time-frequency analysis and statistical analysis were realized based on the inertial measurement unit signals. Results indicate that the tremor frequency was stable for all patients; however, the tremor amplitude fluctuated all the time. Valid state detection algorithm was performed for each assessment task. The mean tremor amplitudes of valid rest and postural tremor tasks correlate well with the clinical scores.

The quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) is one of the effective multi-scale decomposition tools. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multimodal image fusion method using QWT and multiple features. First, we perform QWT on each source image to obtain low-frequency coefficients and high-frequency coefficients. Second, a weighted average fusion rule based on the phase and magnitude of low-frequency subband and spatial variance is proposed to fuse the low-frequency subbands. Next, a choose-max fusion rule based on the contrast and energy of coefficient is proposed to integrate the high-frequency subbands. Finally, the final fused image is constructed by inverse QWT. The proposed method is conducted on multi-focus images, medical images, infrared-visible images, and remote sensing images, respectively.

To combat against these vulnerabilities, there is need to create an awareness of the potential risks of these devices and effective strategies are needed to be implemented to achieve a level of security defense. In this paper, the benefits of healthcare IoT system and the possible vulnerabilities that may result are presented. Also, we propose to develop solutions against these vulnerabilities by protecting mobile applications using obfuscation and return oriented programming techniques. These techniques convert an application into a form which makes difficult for an adversary to interpret or alter the code for illegitimate purpose.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of variation in the time interval between consecutive heart beats. HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;diseases;electronic messaging;file servers;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;protocols;telemedicine;wireless LAN;Zigbee;IoT-based remote HRV monitoring system;hypertensive patients;heart rate variability;HRV analysis;cardiovascular disease;diabetic mellitus;disease states;HRV parameters;Internet of Things technology;Wireless Zigbee-based pulse sensor;short message service;WiFi technology;Zigbee technology;MQTT protocol;Heart rate variability;Monitoring;Servers;ZigBee;Biomedical monitoring;Hypertension;Heart Rate Variability (HRV);Hypertension;Cardiovascular disease;Diabetic mellitus;Internet of Things (IoT);Zigbee;Transport Level Security (TLS);Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)},   doi={10.1109/ICCCSP.2017.7944086},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={398-406},   abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},   keywords={biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;Internet of Things;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;Analog Signal compression;multiplexing technique;traffic data;IoT applications;power consumption;IoT devices;encoding method;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;analog domain;AJSCC device;analog encoding;FPMM receiver;joint modulation;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;multisignal compression method;FPMM technique;healthcare Internet of Things;IoT scalability;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;power saving;SNR operating region;miss detection rate;mean square error;Medical services;Sensors;Power demand;Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Shannon Mapping;Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.62},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={I-Health can be defined as “intelligent system and android, wireless communications technologies for health-care.” This emerging concept represents the evolution of I-Health systems from traditional desktop “telemedicine” platforms to wireless and mobile configurations. The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. This editorial paper presents a snapshot of recent developments in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the I-Health perspective. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these recent developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging concept.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;smart phones;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;intelligent healthcare system;WSN;Android;wireless communications technology;I-Health systems;wireless sensor network;Wireless communication;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Smart phones;Sensors;Routing protocols;Medical services;internet of things;i-health;android;wireless sensors},   doi={10.1109/WCCAIS.2014.6916635},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

 title={Secure Device Bootstrapping Without Secrets Resistant to Signal Manipulation Attacks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={819-835},   abstract={In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of securely bootstrapping a group of wireless devices to a hub, when none of the devices share prior associations (secrets) with the hub or between them. This scenario aligns with the secure deployment of body area networks, IoT, medical devices, industrial automation sensors, autonomous vehicles, and others. We develop VERSE, a physical-layer group message integrity verification primitive that effectively detects advanced wireless signal manipulations that can be used to launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over wireless. Without using shared secrets to establish authenticated channels, such attacks are notoriously difficult to thwart and can undermine the authentication and key establishment processes. VERSE exploits the existence of multiple devices to verify the integrity of the messages exchanged within the group. We then use VERSE to build a bootstrapping protocol, which securely introduces new devices to the network. Compared to the state-of-the-art, VERSE achieves in-band message integrity verification during secure pairing using only the RF modality without relying on out-of-band channels or extensive human involvement. It guarantees security even when the adversary is capable of fully controlling the wireless channel by annihilating and injecting wireless signals. We study the limits of such advanced wireless attacks and prove that the introduction of multiple legitimate devices can be leveraged to increase the security of the pairing process. We validate our claims via theoretical analysis and extensive experimentations on the USRP platform. We further discuss various implementation aspects such as the effect of time synchronization between devices and the effects of multipath and interference. Note that the elimination of shared secrets, default passwords, and public key infrastructures effectively addresses the related key management challenges when these are considered at scale.},   keywords={authorisation;body area networks;cryptographic protocols;data integrity;message authentication;public key cryptography;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless channels;signal manipulation attacks;wireless devices;hub;secure deployment;body area networks;medical devices;industrial automation sensors;autonomous vehicles;VERSE;physical-layer group message integrity;wireless signal manipulations;man-in-the-middle attacks;shared secrets;authenticated channels;key establishment processes;multiple devices;bootstrapping protocol;in-band message integrity verification;secure pairing;out-of-band channels;extensive human involvement;wireless channel;advanced wireless attacks;multiple legitimate devices;pairing process;secure device bootstrapping;wireless signal injection;wireless signal annihilation;Protocols;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Wireless sensor networks;Authentication;Performance evaluation;Physical layer Security;Wireless Signal Manipulation Attack;Man in the Middle Attack;Key Establishment;Message Integrity Protection;Internet of Things;Secret free;Group Bootstrapping;ON OFF Keying},   doi={10.1109/SP.2018.00055},   ISSN={2375-1207},   month={May},}

  year={2017},   volume={17},   number={5},   pages={1538-1548},   abstract={Deadline constrained packet scheduling and transmission are important in real-time multimedia applications. This is because packets missing their deadlines would become useless and are frequently dropped, which seriously degrade the quality of service (QoS). As the utilization of Internet of Things has become mature, multimedia data transmission is a key component to promote the QoS of citizens. To fulfill the QoS requirement in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with multimedia content, the combination of multiple transmission methods is encouraged for packet forwarding, including conventional network coding, analog network coding, plain routing, and direct transmission (i.e., no-relaying, NR). The diversity of transmission method is helpful to lower packet dropping probability, while complicating the packet transmitting and scheduling process instead. Therefore, we first introduce an exhaustive search method to obtain the optimal scheduling sequence and corresponding transmission method for deadline constrained multimedia transmissions in WSNs. With the objective of promoting computing efficiency for the formulated problem, we then propose two heuristic methods based on the Markov chain approximation and the dynamic graph, respectively. Simulation results illustrate that our methods can effectively reduce packet dropping probability and simulation time, so that QoS of individuals can be promoted.},   keywords={diversity reception;graph theory;Markov processes;multimedia communication;quality of service;search problems;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks;QoS;high efficiency resource allocation;wireless multimedia sensor networks;deadline constrained packet scheduling;packet transmission;quality of service;Internet of Things;multimedia data transmission;wireless sensor networks;packet forwarding;analog network coding;plain routing;transmission method diversity;exhaustive search method;optimal scheduling sequence;heuristic methods;Markov chain approximation;dynamic graph;Delays;Wireless sensor networks;Quality of service;Multimedia communication;Scheduling;Sensors;Wireless communication;QoS;packet dropping;scheduling;adaptive transmission},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2016.2645709},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={March},}

This is due to the lack of harmonization and interoperable IP-based networking solutions. With the operators currently migrating to broadband IP infrastructures, emergency systems also need to follow this path and adapt their emergency communication platforms to fulfill next generation emergency services regulatory requirements. This becomes even more evident in light of the forthcoming 5G networks, which are envisioned to support an amalgam of diverse applications and services with heterogeneous performance requirements, including mission-critical IoT communication, massive machine-type communication, and gigabit mobile connectivity. Emergency service operators face an enormous challenge in order to synchronize their model of operation with the 5G paradigm. This article studies the challenges that next generation emergency services need to overcome in order to fulfill the requirements for rich-content, real-time, location-specific communications.

EEG signals were first decomposed into independent components (ICs) by independent component analysis (ICA). Using temporal correlation theory, the sum of the correlation values between each IC and the EEG signals at some special electrodes was calculated, respectively. Consequently, all the correlation values were sorted by descending order. The ICs which have significantly bigger correlation than the other ICs were picked to set as eye-blink artifact components, which were then set as zero to reconstruct clean EEG signals. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated on some contaminated EEG signals.

We have built an application called 'ECG Android App' which provides the end user with visualization of their Electro Cardiogram (ECG) waves and data logging functionality in the background. The logged data can be uploaded to the user's private centralized cloud or a specific medical cloud, which keeps a record of all the monitored data and can be retrieved for analysis by the medical personnel. Though the idea of building a medical application using IoT and cloud techniques is not totally new, there is a lack of empirical studies in building such a system. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of IoT. Further, the paper presents an infrastructure for the healthcare domain, which consists of various technologies: IOIO microcontroller, signal processing, communication protocols, secure and efficient mechanisms for large file transfer, data base management system, and the centralized cloud. The paper emphasizes on the system and software architecture and design which is essential to overall IoT and cloud based medical applications.

Along the same line, the smart health concept (s-Health), understood as a context-aware healthcare paradigm for smart environments, improves the quality of healthcare systems within smart cities. However, s-Health may encounter some privacy and security issues. For example, in order to obtain the current location and health conditions of citizens, these citizens might be continuously monitored, which could be seen as a privacy invasion. In this paper, we describe an application within the s-Health paradigm. In particular, our approach allows to effectively deal with citizens who have respiratory conditions. Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen. Besides the description of the application, the main contribution of the article is the analysis of the emerging privacy issues of the proposed application and the discussion of possible countermeasures.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;mobile computing;security of data;smart cities;smart health application;s-Health;privacy issues;smart cities;mobile health;m-Health;context-aware health care paradigm;health care systems;security issues;respiratory conditions;low-pollution routes;water sprays;Privacy;Pollution;Medical services;Smart cities;Mobile handsets;Databases;Smart Health;Smart City Architectures;Privacy;Security},   doi={10.1109/SCSPW.2016.7509558},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

For this promising class of m-Health services, we introduce reference scenarios of personalized assistance for a mobile patient with focus on emergency cases.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={The ever-increasing demand for biometric solutions for the internet of thing (IoT)-based connected health applications is mainly driven by the need to tackle fraud issues, along with the imperative to improve patient privacy, safety and personalized medical assistance. However, the advantages offered by the IoT platforms come with the burden of big data and its associated challenges in terms of computing complexity, bandwidth availability and power consumption. This paper proposes a solution to tackle both privacy issues and big data transmission by incorporating the theory of compressive sensing (CS) and a simple, yet, efficient identification mechanism using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as a biometric trait. Moreover, the paper presents the hardware implementation of the proposed solution on a system on chip (SoC) platform with an optimized architecture to further reduce hardware resource usage. First, we investigate the feasibility of compressing the ECG data while maintaining a high identification quality. The obtained results show a 98.88% identification rate using only a compression ratio of 30%. Furthermore, the proposed system has been implemented on a Zynq SoC using heterogeneous software/hardware solution, which is able to accelerate the software implementation by a factor of 7.73 with a power consumption of 2.318 W.},   keywords={Electrocardiography;Sensors;Power demand;Hardware;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sparse matrices;Greedy algorithms;Internet of things (IoT);compressive sensing (CS);zynq SoC;reconstruction algorithms;pattern recognition},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2018.2871411},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={},}

 title={Elastic Management of Physical Spaces and Objects in Multi-Hospital Environments}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={33-38},   abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).},   keywords={biomedical equipment;client-server systems;cloud computing;decision making;health care;medical information systems;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;virtual machines;Web services;object elastic management;physical space elastic management;multihospital environments;medical treatment;health equipments;elastic multihospital management model;EMH model;cloud elasticity facility;distributed framework;multiple healthcare institutions;centralized management control center;virtual machines;real-time decision making;RFID;radio-frequency identification sensor tracking technology;client-server Web service;motion detection;Hospitals;Cloud computing;Elasticity;Radiofrequency identification;Databases;Hospitals;Performance;Cloud;Elasticity},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.33},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={4609-4617},   abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where WSNs will play an important role in future internet by several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M&amp;lt;;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},   keywords={cognitive radio;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;multi armed bandit channel access scheme;cognitive radio technology;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;spectrum scarcity problem;fair channel-grouping scheme;water-filling principle;distributed learning algorithm;Internet of things;Wireless sensor networks;Cognitive radio;Medical services;Agriculture;I.I.D. multi-armed bandit;fairness access scheme;channel-grouping;modified UCB-tuned},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2600633},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

When this IoT technology is combined with Augmented Reality (AR), it will provide end users with real time as well as real world information. One of the prime advantages of AR combining with IoT is the bridging of the gap between the real and digital worlds around us. The ease of downloading features and scope of dynamic usage which AR brings to the smart devices and is expected to bring to the IoT is beyond human imagination! The education sector is expected to gain significantly using these technologies. The goal of technology in education is to make, learning easier, faster and more engaging for the students and to equip the instructor with powerful tools to provide more relevant courseware to their students. With introducing AR in education, we shall be able to provide contextually aware, more relevant, engaging and interactive courseware to the students, which would keep them interested in subject. Also, through IoT, the physical devices can provide context that the AR ecosystem would use for contextually aware rendering of multimedia content. Medical education domain is expected to gain significantly using IOT and AR. It is also observed that the training in the areas of equipment maintenance could gain significantly by applying these technologies judiciously. For eg. The conventional software virtual lab solution does not provide a real feel of performing an experiment. However, using IOT and AR technology, a sensor enabled Hardware based real lab environment can be created for performing the volumetric analysis experiments in chemistry by using WATER instead of Chemicals. C-DAC has developed few AR products in education domain - AR Board, AR Book and AR Game. AR Board is a virtual writing board on which a user can write with a laser pointer. It uses projection based AR Technology by creating a virtual environment for contextual information presentation, and facilitates real-time interaction with the content. AR Book is a standard book that has been instrumented with AR markers printed, which when scanned would show augmented, 3D interactive content, videos, audio and animations contextually, on a printed book, thus adding new dimensionality to it. AR Game is a game based learning mobile application that can be used by students for learning through playing, and for evaluating their knowledge. The technology of these products has been transferred to industry for their further development and proliferation to various educational institutes.},   keywords={augmented reality;biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;Internet of Things;mobile computing;augmented reality;smart devices;IoT technology;education sector;medical education domain;Internet of Things technology;IoT;e-learning;AR technology;AR board;AR book;AR game;game based learning mobile application},   doi={10.1109/ELELTECH.2017.8074987},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Pressure mats and camera analysis are frequently used to determine a person's chair posture. Measurement of parameters can be derived from a variety of different sensor types, which may already be present in an environment. This paper presents the use of the concept of “sensory substitution,” where a sensor designed to measure Quantity X is used to measure Quantity Y. The concept is used to enable alternative sensing techniques for medical and security applications, such as determining chair occupancy, postural shift times, and even current postural state, without using cameras or pressure sensors. Specifically, the postural state of a subject is determined in a laboratory study using various arrays of both temperature sensors and acoustic sensors. This method can be used standalone, can augment other sensors, or can validate data from pressure or visual-based systems. These alternative sensors could also be used for other aspects of smart infrastructure. The system was tested with different types and styles of furniture, including chairs, armrests, cushions, and beds. A least mean square algorithm was deployed to remove noises enabling acoustic posture detection. Using a thresholding algorithm, postural changes are then identified using audio. In a controlled environment, over 90% of postural change events were detected. Thus, the paper shows two alternative instrumentation and measurement methods to determine occupancy, postural change timings, and even posture states of a person in a chair.},   keywords={acoustic transducers;audio signal processing;least mean squares methods;medical signal processing;temperature sensors;acoustic posture detection;postural changes;postural change events;postural change timings;posture states;pressure mats;camera analysis;alternative sensing techniques;medical security applications;chair occupancy;postural shift times;current postural state;temperature sensors;acoustic sensors;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Pressure measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Acoustic;adaptive signal processing;Internet of Things (IoT);least mean square (LMS);low cost;normalized least mean square (NLMS);posture;pressure;sensors;smart environment;temperature sensor;unobtrusive sensors},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2018.2795158},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={July},}

There currently exists no way to objectively determine the degree of mobility in PD or effectiveness of a symptom-easing prescription medication. Therefore, an e-textile device was fabricated as a glove, using a wireless microprocessor and a flex sensor in order to transmit motion data into a personal, patient-oriented app. A neoprene e-textile was constructed using: a flex sensor on the index finger to detect the range of motion, a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Nano for processing and wireless transmission of data and an IMU (Inertia Measurement Unit) to detect tremors. The circuitry was powered using a 3-volt battery and connections were made using conductive thread. The BLE Nano was programmed with Arduino software to convert Flex Sensor data into a meaningful graph. The main goal was not only to create a more accurate way for data collection of PD patients but also to make the process personal and comfortable without frequent visits to a physician.

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},   keywords={authorisation;electronic health records;granular computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic matching;semantic rule reasoning;personal health record;role-based access control;attribute-based access control;granular security concepts;ontology;social care providers;health care providers;granularity levels;patient-specified authorization policies;RABAC;local security policies;data access;patient-centered model;healthcare information systems;information storage;healthcare professional component;health information transmission;medical device component;nonhealthcare providers;social information collection;health information collection;nonhealthcare component;patient data;IOT;Internet of things;cloud computing;virtual PHR authorization system;Authorization;Ontologies;Medical services;Cloud computing;Semantics;Filtering},   doi={10.1109/BHI.2014.6864307},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={June},}

CVDs rank #1 in the world when it comes to diseases causing deaths. More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. Around 17 million people died from CVDs in the year 2012, representing 31% of all global deaths. In India alone there are around 64 million cardiac patients and only 4000 cardiologists available. Arrhythmia is the most frequent occurring CVD. Patients having Arrhythmia require continuous monitoring so that the doctor can study the abnormality in their heart beats to gain further insights and suggest treatments. In some cases Arrhythmia can be fatal and might need immediate hospitalization. For this purpose, we have developed a system that remotely acquires ECG sensor readings (taken from MIT-BIH database) of the patient, processes it to predict arrhythmia intelligently and sends the indication alarm immediately to the doctor, when an Arrhythmia episode is detected. Also a report of the patient's heart behavior is generated and fetched to the doctor on his smart phone. Our system aims at spreading cardiac care to urban as well as rural places by enabling the remote monitoring the ECG signals of the afflicted cardiac patients and alerting the doctor in case of emergencies.},   keywords={Electrocardiography;Medical services;Band-pass filters;Feature extraction;Low-pass filters;Signal processing algorithms;Heart rate;Internet of Things (IOT);remote monitoring;electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing},   doi={10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754293},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment.

HEAL uses a multimodal distributed camera network to monitor and identify ICU activities and estimate sanitation-event qualifiers.

The proposed approach for activity representation identifies contextual aspects basis and estimates aspect weights for proper action representation and reconstruction. The flexibility of the proposed algorithms enables the identification of people roles by associating them with inferred interactions and detected activities. A fully working prototype system is developed, tested in a mock ICU room and then deployed in two ICU rooms at a community hospital, thus offering unique capabilities for data gathering and analytics. The proposed method achieves a role identification accuracy of 84% and a backtracking role identification of 79% for obscured roles using interaction and appearance features on real ICU data.

While various techniques have been used for dietary monitoring in clinical trials and user studies, they are not ready for daily use. Existing solutions either require tedious manual recording or may impede normal daily activities. In this paper, a pair of diet-aware glasses is designed. The key idea here is that when people wear glasses, the temples of the glasses are in touch with the lower part of the temporalis muscle, one of the mastication muscles. By integrating an electromyography (EMG) sensor into glasses, the glasses can measure the muscle activity of the temporalis to detect intake-related events. This paper instantiates the idea by building a prototype equipped with an EMG sensor, a microcontroller, SD shield/card and a Bluetooth radio. When working together with a smartphone, the glasses can provide detailed information on intake schedule, the number of chewing cycles and broad food category. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven subjects and the results show appealing prospects for our diet-aware glasses. The prototype achieves 96% accuracy for counting the number of chewing cycles and up to 90.8% accuracy for classifying five types of food.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Bluetooth;electromyography;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;smart phones;wearable computers;dietary monitoring;electromyography sensors;disease diagnosis;body weight control;dietary habit management;patients;dieters;nutritionists;normal daily activities;diet-aware glasses;EMG;microcontroller;SD shield-card;Bluetooth radio;smartphone;chewing cycles;broad food category;Glass;Monitoring;Electromyography;Sensors;Bluetooth;Schedules;Biomedical monitoring;Dietary monitoring;electromyography (EMG);glasses},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2656151},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

 title={Receiver Design for a Bionic Nervous System: Modeling the Dendritic Processing Power}, 
  year={2016},   volume={3},   number={1},   pages={27-37},   abstract={Intrabody nanonetworks for nervous system monitoring are envisioned as a key application of the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) paradigm, with the aim of developing radically new medical diagnosis and treatment techniques. Indeed, very recently, bionic devices have been implanted inside a living human brain as innovative treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. In this context, this paper proposes a systems-theoretic communication model to capture the actual behavior of biological neurons. Specifically, biological neurons exhibit physical extension due to their projections called dendrites, which propagate the electrochemical stimulation received via synapses to the soma. Experimental evidences show that the dendrites exhibit two main features: 1) the compartmentalization at the level of the dendritic branches of the neuronal processes and 2) the location-dependent preference for different frequencies. Stemming from these experimental evidences, we propose to model the dendritic tree as a spatiotemporal filter bank, where each filter models the behavior in both space and time of a dendritic branch. Each filter is fully characterized along with the overall neuronal response. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on the incoming stimulus for inducing a null-neuronal response are derived. The conducted theoretical analysis shows that: 1) the neuronal information is encoded in the stimulus temporal pattern, i.e., it is possible to select the neuron to affect by changing the stimulus frequency content; in this sense, the communication among neurons is frequency-selective and 2) the spatial distribution of the dendrites affects the neuronal response; in this sense, the communication among neurons is spatial-selective. The theoretical analysis is validated through a real neuron morphology.},   keywords={brain;channel bank filters;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical disorders;nanomedicine;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;spatiotemporal phenomena;receiver design;bionic nervous system;dendritic processing power modeling;intrabody nanonetworks;nervous system monitoring;Internet-of-NanoThings;medical diagnosis;treatment techniques;living human brain;innovative treatment;drug-resistant epilepsy;systems-theoretic communication;biological neurons;physical extension;electrochemical stimulation;soma synapses;neuronal processes;location-dependent preference;spatiotemporal filter bank;filter models;null-neuronal response;theoretical analysis;neuronal information;stimulus temporal pattern;frequency-selective distribution;spatial distribution;real neuron morphology;Neurons;Cutoff frequency;Nanobioscience;Biological system modeling;Impedance;Biomembranes;Spatiotemporal phenomena;IoNT;intrabody networks;nanonetworks;receiver;spatial-frequency selectivity;dendritic tree;Dendritic tree;Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT);intrabody networks;nanonetworks;receiver;spatial-frequency selectivity},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2438098},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

Their true impact on patient care is highly dependent on the quality and relevancy of the data acquired. The design of circuits and systems to answer the growing demand and the necessity to have portable and connected devices lead to a focus on designing ultra-low power apparatus, mixed-signal devices, using nanoscale electronics. Microelectronic issues are therefore at the heart of the demand. All this requires inter-disciplinary collaborations between scientists, engineers, medical researchers, and practitioners. The interconnection of these embedded devices, known as Internet of Things, is expected to usher in the medical field, among others to study the cardiovascular system of patients.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={660-660},   abstract={Summary form only given. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},   keywords={cognition;health care;home computing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;cognitive health assessment;IoT;signal processing;machine learning techniques;technology-guided algorithmic methodology;smart home health service systems;Alzheimers patients;retirement community centers;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917641},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

This talk will give an overview of ongoing research at Northeastern University exploring a radically different approach, i.e., establishing wireless networked systems in human tissues that transfer data and energy through acoustic waves at ultrasonic frequencies. We will start off by discussing applications of networked implantable medical systems. We will then analyze fundamental aspects of ultrasonic propagation in human tissues and their impact on the design of wireless networking protocols at different layers of the protocol stack.

 title={Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities}, 
  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2-3},   abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain and the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},   keywords={Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;smart data;Big Data;personalized digital health;metadata;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;semantic perception;ontologies;domain models;vocabularies;semantic interoperability;continuous semantics;Big Data volume;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity},   doi={10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;Internet of Things;radio links;security of data;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things security;IoT security;wireless sensor networking;machine-2-machine communication;M2M communication;wireless bodyworn sensing device security;health infrastructure;medical applications;symmetric spatiotemporal characteristics;wireless link;link fingerprint matching;data session},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457124},   ISSN={},   month={March},}
