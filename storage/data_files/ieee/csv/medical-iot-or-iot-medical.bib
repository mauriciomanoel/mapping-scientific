  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={EpharmacyNet is a Mail order pharmacy designed and implemented for developing countries. Most of the sub-Saharan African (SSA) healthcare systems are facing severe medicine supply issues, People living in rural regions or small cities have limited access to the pharmaceutical care. Medicines are scarce, people are living more than 30 km far from a pharmacy. Medicines are regularly out of stock. EpharmacyNet was implemented to improve access to pharmaceutical care in these countries. In-site test results had shown the potential of EpharmacyNet to fixe above-described issues. In this paper, the author presents an IoT-based smart medicine transportation and medication monitoring system as an extension of EpharmacyNet. The IoT (M2M) technology-based system is designed for secure transportation and quick delivery of medicines as well as medication monitoring to increase treatment adherence in case of chronic health condition.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;mail order;medical supplies;patient monitoring;patient treatment;pharmaceuticals;EPharmacyNet;Mail order pharmacy;sub-Saharan African healthcare systems;severe medicine supply issues;pharmaceutical care;medication monitoring system;IoT technology-based system;IoT-based smart medicine transportation;Internet of Things (IoT);Medical treatment adherence;smart system;EpharmacyNet;Medication monitoring},   doi={10.1109/IREEHI.2017.8350381},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={A PHY-Aided Secure IoT Healthcare System with Collaboration of Social Networks}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={This paper proposes a novel physical-layer-aided security technique for protecting a social Internet of things (SIoT) architecture-based healthcare system. Exploiting the social relationship link between healthcare user (e.g., patients and elderly people) and healthcare provider (e.g., physicians), social networks can play the role of a trusted online platform to establish service application interfaces between healthcare user (HU) and healthcare provider (HP). This enables the Internet of things (IoT) medical devices (e.g., IoT body sensor) to timely share the bio-data of HU with remote HP via the both storage-rich and computational resource-rich social networks. Given the high security requirement on SIoT data sharing and the fact that resource-constrained IoT devices cannot efficiently execute complicated cryptography, a robust and cost-effective two-phase security method is proposed by exploiting the device-specific physical-layer (PHY) attributes. Specifically, the PHY carrier frequency offset and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance of an IoT device are practically estimated to generate the PHY-ID. Using our PHY-ID, the SIoT HU authentication and the bio-data confidentiality are simultaneously enhanced without posing any additional implementation overhead at IoT body sensors, which is especially applicable for the resource-constrained IoT devices.},   keywords={body sensor networks;computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;social networking (online);bio-data confidentiality;IoT body sensor;PHY-aided secure IoT healthcare system;social relationship link;healthcare user;healthcare provider;trusted online platform;service application interfaces;remote HP;computational resource-rich social networks;SIoT data sharing;novel physical-layer-aided security technique;social Internet of things architecture-based healthcare system;Internet of things medical devices;storage-rich social networks;device-specific physical layer attributes;PHY carrier frequency offset;SIoT HU authentication;PHY-ID;in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance;two-phase security method;resource-constrained IoT devices;Medical services;Estimation;Social network services;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288341},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

 title={An On-Demand WebRTC and IoT Device Tunneling Service for Hospitals}, 
  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={53-60},   abstract={In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;firewalls;health care;hospitals;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;wireless LAN;on-demand IoT device tunneling service;on-demand WebRTC service;WebRTC gateway service;ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic;local hospital network;local home network;tunnel sensor;medical devices;home-care deployments;hospital firewall;external machines;NAT;local WiFi network;VPN solutions;WebRTC traffic;concurrent streams;local gateway services;direct browser-to-browser connection;WebRTC;Logic gates;Browsers;Protocols;Hospitals;Ports (Computers);Standards;webrtc;rtc;palcom;iot;medical applications},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.19},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={668-671},   abstract={Epilepsy is a common neural disorder disease, while difficult to cure. There is still a risk of suffering from seizures even though patients have used antiepileptic drugs or had an operation. In such cases, patients must be immediately taken care; on the other hand, how to avoid introducing danger to their family and people around is also a concern. To address this issue, we integrate and develop a health cloud system to detect, record, and further predict epileptic seizure, which includes a dedicated wearable device for detection, a medical-IoT box to avoid heavy computation on the wearable device and provide cross reference to cameras, a cloud computing platform for complex computation, and an application on tablets for health care professionals. We propose a reactive and highly programmable model for such a system to allow health care professionals to easily and quickly query data from different devices and customize the trigger conditions, while optimize computing resource to achieve power saving on devices. We base this research on reactive programming (RP), which recently attracts the interests of researchers and developers, to construct our model, and develop a domain-specific language (DSL) that is applied among the medical-IoT box, cloud computing, and user interface for health care professionals. Such a DSL must be easy-to-write since health care professionals are not necessarily experts in programming, but it must also be powerful enough to allow them to query the logging data, analyze the interaction between different devices, and further configure the setting of devices for individual patients to benefit from our platform. At the same time, it automatically optimizes the communication and computation based the trigger conditions to achieve power saving on devices.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;query processing;query customization;trigger optimization;home care systems;epilepsy;common neural disorder disease;health cloud system;medical-IoT box;health care professionals;reactive programming;domain-specific language;cloud computing;user interface;Medical services;Programming profession;Cloud computing;DSL;Mobile handsets;Cameras;reactive programming;domain-specific language;epileptic seizure detection;health cloud platform},   doi={10.1109/ICASI.2017.7988514},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game to balance the tradeoff between network performance and security level while taking into account the context dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve an acceptable security level and is more efficient than benchmark algorithms in terms of network lifetime and throughput.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;patient care;quality of service;stochastic games;health domain;ubiquitous healthcare;constant monitoring;wireless body area network;highly suitable communication tool;medical IoT devices;WBAN applications;network lifetime;network throughput;data criticality;QoS requirements;stochastic game;network performance;acceptable security level;constrained wireless body area networks;security effectiveness;Security;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Quality of service;Games;Sensors;Adaptation models;IoT;Health;WBAN;Game theory;Nash Equilibrium Adaptive security;QoS requirements},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2018.8319222},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming a reality, power-efficient techniques are crucial to achieve sufficient battery lifetimes. Whereas current medical IoT devices typically acquire data with a constant quality, we propose an architecture that dynamically adjusts the data quality adaptively based on the current medical condition of the subject being monitored. Since transmission and processing make up a large fraction of the energy consumption, the reduction of the link traffic and processing effort caused by such an adjustment results in a decreased energy consumption of the devices. For example, if anomalies in the monitored data are detected, the monitoring is performed with an increased granularity and more exhaustive processing. Further, not all data generated by the medical sensors needs to be transmitted during all times. Only if certain events are detected, the transmission of the complete data needs to be activated. In this paper, we present a novel approach for body-worn medical IoT devices. In particular, a generic, distributed architecture for the power-management of the whole system, which is based on dynamically switching services, is presented. We show that such an architecture can reduce the energy-consumption of medical sensors by up to 80 % in real-world measurements.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Internet of Things;medical computing;switching networks;dynamic service switching;Internet of Things;power-efficient techniques;battery lifetimes;data quality;link traffic;processing effort;granularity;exhaustive processing;body-worn medical IoT devices;generic distributed architecture;power-management;dynamically switching services;Sensors;Electrocardiography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Switches;Heart rate variability;Mobile communication},   doi={10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794845},   ISSN={2166-9589},   month={Sept},}

  year={2015},   volume={11},   number={6},   pages={1653-1659},   abstract={This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading from medical cloud storage to medical Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The medical cloud can distribute its own medical data to medical IoT devices via access points. Therefore, network disconnection can happen between the medical cloud and medical IoT devices when power/energy management in each access point is not efficient. This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance.},   keywords={cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network reliability;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical information systems;power aware computing;energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading;medical IoT platform;polynomial-time algorithm;medical cloud storage;medical Internet-of-Things devices;medical data distribution;access points;medical cloud devices;in-hospital network architecture;dynamic energy-efficient algorithm;power allocation;buffer backlog size;channel states;buffer stability;adaptive energy management;adaptive power management;network lifetime;Heuristic algorithms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Energy-Efficiency;Dynamic Buffering;Medical Platforms;Internet of Things;Dynamic buffering;energy efficiency;Internet of Things (IoT);medical platforms},   doi={10.1109/TII.2015.2434773},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Dec},}

One of its promising branches, the medical IoT, will also be accompanied by heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures. However, the efficacy of a medical IoT application will depend on how well the surrounding smart devices collaborate with it to serve the individual needs of the users. Pre-programmed solutions lack flexibility to adapt to each need and environment, and fail to make full use of the capabilities of a set of smart devices. In this paper, we propose a concept based on the flexible and user-friendly synthesis and switching of services for medical IoT applications. The crux of the concept is to provide a methodology in which non-experts can dynamically define services based on their needs. We describe a potential scenario, discuss the associated challenges, and present preliminary results on the feasibility of this approach. Particularly, we focus on design aspects for realizing the concept and propose the use of interpreters on the smart devices as alternative solution. We show that such an approach is feasible in terms of implementation and energy consumption while still maintaining the full flexibility of the service synthesis.},   keywords={ambient intelligence;assisted living;cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;medical computing;dynamic service synthesis;service switching;medical IoT;ambient assisted living;Internet of Things;heterogeneous smart-home infrastructures;smart device collaboration;user-friendly synthesis;cyber-physical systems;cloud computing;Ambient Assisted Living;Cyber-Physical Systems;Automatic Synthesis;Wireless Sensor Networks},   doi={10.1109/HLDVT.2016.7748259},   ISSN={2471-7827},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={Recent advances in embedded and IoT (internet-of-things) technologies are rapidly transforming health-care solutions and we are headed to a future of smaller, smarter, wearable and connected medical devices. IoT and advanced health sensors provide more convenience to patients and physicians. Where physicians can now wirelessly and automatically monitor patient's state. While these medical embedded devices provide a lot of new opportunities to improve the health care system, they also introduce a new set of security risks since they are connected to networks. More importantly, these devices are extremely hardware- and power-constrained, which in turn makes securing these devices more complex. Implementing complex malware detectors or anti-virus on these devices is either very costly or infeasible due to these limitations on power and resources. In this paper, we propose a new framework called SYNDROME for “externally” monitoring medical embedded devices. Our malware detector uses electromagnetic (EM) signals involuntary generated by the device as it executes a (medical) application in the absence of malware, and analyzes them to build a reference model. It then monitors the EM signals generated by the device during execution and reports an error if there is a statistically significant deviation from the reference model. To evaluate Syndrome, we use open-source software to implement a real-world medical device, called a Syringe Pump, on a variety of well-known embedded/IoT devices including Arduino Uno, FPGA Nios II soft-core, and two Linux IoT mini-computers: OlimexA13 and TS-7250. We also implement a control-flow hijack attack on SyringePump and use Syndrome to detect and stop the attack. Our experimental results show that using Syndrome, we can detect the attack for all the four devices with excellent accuracy (i.e. 0% false positive and 100% true positive) within few milliseconds after the attack starts.},   keywords={embedded systems;health care;Internet of Things;invasive software;medical computing;public domain software;SYNDROME;malware detector;Syndrome;real-world medical device;Linux IoT mini-computers;Spectral analysis;anomaly detection;medical IoT;internet-of-things;health-care solutions;wearable devices;connected medical devices;advanced health sensors;health care system;security risks;complex malware detectors;medical embedded devices;embedded/IoT devices;electromagnetic signals;open-source software;Syringe Pump;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Malware;Hardware;Medical diagnostic imaging;Clocks;Hardware Security;Malware Detection;Internet-of-Things;Embedded System},   doi={10.1109/HST.2018.8383884},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={8418-8441},   abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;middleware;distributed data collection protocol;IoHT devices;intensive privacy preserving processes;privacy regulation frameworks;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;concealment process;holistic privacy middleware;personal gateways;sensitive health information;cloud-based healthcare services;accountability act;health insurance portability;personal health information;privacy laws;healthcare data;healthcare provider;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;living organism;healthcare Web services;hospital setting;personalized health insights;health data;healthcare delivery;Internet of Healthcare Things;healthcare things;OECD privacy principles;automated compliance;fog based middleware;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data privacy;Data models;Logic gates;Privacy;Internet of things;Patient monitoring;Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Fall detection is an interesting scientific problem and an ill-defined process that can be solved through various methods. In this paper, various methods and detection algorithms based on wearable sensors are introduced. A benchmark database, namely, a fall detection database, is presented to evaluate the performance of detection algorithms. This database collects sample data from 26 males and 24 females performing 15 kinds of activities, including falls and activities of daily life, such as walking, running, and walking upstairs. The subjects comprise 50 males and females ranging from 21 to 60 years of age, 1.55 to 1.90 m in height, and 40 to 85 kg in weight. A full comparison between the existing databases and the proposed database is presented. Four baseline algorithms (the artificial neutral network, k nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and kernel Fisher discriminant) are used to evaluate the databases’ reliabilities. Evaluation protocols based on the fall detection database are discussed, and the performance of the four algorithms as a baseline are presented for the following objectives: 1) to elementarily assess the database through the fall detection algorithms; 2) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the common algorithms; and 3) to obtain the evaluation results for two classes and multiple classes based on the database. In hospitals, it is helpful to build a fall detection system for some patients who are unconscious and unable to call for help after falling down.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={33859-33870},   abstract={When executing a program or storing data in a medical Internet of Things (mIoT) system, physical side-channels analysis, such as recent-timing, cold-reboot, and virtual-machine attacks, might obtain partial information about internal sensitive medical data/states in memory that the attacker can gain partial privacy information. Leakage-resilient cryptography has led to better implementation of many cryptographic primitives that can be proven secure against attackers who can obtain limited sensitive information about private keys, randomness, and other internal states, and therefore prevents from breaking the security. In this paper, to tolerate the sensitive information leakage in mIoT, we first present a leakage-resilient public-key encryption mechanism that is semantically secure against adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks in the presence of key leakage under standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our construction employs a special universal hashing in multiplicative group to provide an efficient strong extractor, and a key derivation function to derive one or more symmetric keys from a single value. Also, the plaintext space of the scheme is extended to the full domain field of group so as to provide a larger space for the message. We emphasis that our scheme can be deployed in mIoT since the limited power and energy budgets, the communication and computation cost, and the leakage attack are taken into account. Using the first scheme as a building block, we also give a protocol construction to achieve the security resilient to randomness leakage and key leakage. Our schemes feature with a shorter key size and a larger plaintext space. Concretely, the private-key contains only four elements in the finite field, and the allowable key-leakage rate is 25%, which provides a higher leakage rate than Naor Segev (leakage rate is 16.7%) and its variants. It is worth highlighting of the construction resilient to both key leakage and randomness leakage, simultaneously, and is flexible to deploy in easy-to-attack outdoor nodes such as in medical IoT and smart grids, since in these nodes the private keys and randomness are either stored or generated in outdoor privacy-aware environments.},   keywords={computer network security;data privacy;Internet of Things;medical computing;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;virtual machines;partial privacy information;leakage-resilient cryptography;private keys;sensitive information leakage;leakage-resilient public-key encryption mechanism;adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks;key derivation function;symmetric keys;leakage attack;randomness leakage;easy-to-attack outdoor nodes;key-leakage rate;computation cost;communication cost;limited energy budget;limited power budget;universal hashing;standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption;cryptographic primitives;internal sensitive medical states;internal sensitive medical data;virtual-machine attack;cold-reboot attack;recent-timing attack;physical side-channels analysis;mIoT system;medical Internet-of-Things system;leakage-rate privacy-aware Internet-of-Things;plaintext-space;sensitive-leakage;plaintext space;key size;Encryption;Internet of Things;Random access memory;Public key;Protocols;Sensitive information leakage;key entropy;randomness leakage;leakage rate;medical Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2842713},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Ultra-Low Power QRS Detection and ECG Compression Architecture for IoT Healthcare Devices}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-11},   abstract={An ultra-low power electrocardiogram (ECG) processing architecture with an adequate level of accuracy is a necessity for Internet of Things (IoT) medical wearable devices. This paper presents a novel real-time QRS detector and an ECG compression architecture for IoT healthcare devices. An absolute-value curve length transform (A-CLT) is proposed that effectively enhances the QRS complex detection with minimized hardware resources. The proposed architecture requires adders, shifters, and comparators only, and removes the need for any multipliers. QRS detection was accomplished by using adaptive thresholds in the A-CLT transformed ECG signal, and achieved a sensitivity of 99.37% and the predictivity of 99.38% when validated using Physionet ECG database. Furthermore, a lossless compression technique was incorporated into the proposed architecture that uses the ECG signal first derivative and entropy encoding. An average compression ratio of 2.05 was achieved when evaluated using MIT-BIH database. The proposed QRS detection architecture deals with almost all the ECG signal artifacts, such as low-frequency noise, baseline drift, and high-frequency interference with minimum hardware resources. The proposed QRS architecture was synthesized using 65-nm low-power process using standard-cell-based flow. The power consumption of the design was 6.5 nW while operating at a supply of 1 V and a frequency of 250 Hz. Moreover, the system could benefit from duty-cycling.},   keywords={Electrocardiography;Computer architecture;Transmitters;Medical services;Transforms;Low-power electronics;Power demand;Elecrocardiogram;QRS complex;computational complexity;absolute value curve length transform;compression.},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2018.2867746},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={One of the challenges faced by today's Internet of Things (IoT) is to efficiently support machine-to-machine communication, given that the remote sensors and the gateway devices are connected through low bandwidth, unreliable, or intermittent wireless communication links. In this paper, we quantitatively compare the performance of IoT protocols, namely MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), DDS (Data Distribution Service) and a custom UDP-based protocol in a medical setting. The performance of the protocols was evaluated using a network emulator, allowing us to emulate a low bandwidth, high system latency, and high packet loss wireless access network. This paper reports the observed performance of the protocols and arrives at the conclusion that although DDS results in higher bandwidth usage than MQTT, its superior performance with regard to data latency and reliability makes it an attractive choice for medical IoT applications and beyond.},   keywords={Internet of Things;protocols;radio networks;IoT protocols;constrained wireless access network;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;MQTT;message queuing telemetry transport;CoAP;constrained application protocol;DDS;data distribution service;UDP-based protocol;Protocols;Servers;Internet of things;Logic gates;Bandwidth;Telemetry;Sensors;Internet of Things;Constrained Wireless Access Network;Protocols;Medical Applications;CoAP;MQTT;DDS},   doi={10.1109/MoWNet.2016.7496622},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology is a key facilitator for AAL. IoMT provides medical services that make smart hospital, doctors and patients interact in harmony leading to elevated healthcare levels. In this paper, we develop an integrated medical platform for remote health monitoring. The proposed multi-layer architecture senses and collects information about the patient vitals alongside his/her surrounding environment. Then, it relays such information to a cloud for storage and data analysis where further actions are applied for a better end user experience.

 title={Secure Device Bootstrapping Without Secrets Resistant to Signal Manipulation Attacks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={819-835},   abstract={In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of securely bootstrapping a group of wireless devices to a hub, when none of the devices share prior associations (secrets) with the hub or between them. This scenario aligns with the secure deployment of body area networks, IoT, medical devices, industrial automation sensors, autonomous vehicles, and others. We develop VERSE, a physical-layer group message integrity verification primitive that effectively detects advanced wireless signal manipulations that can be used to launch man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over wireless. Without using shared secrets to establish authenticated channels, such attacks are notoriously difficult to thwart and can undermine the authentication and key establishment processes. VERSE exploits the existence of multiple devices to verify the integrity of the messages exchanged within the group. We then use VERSE to build a bootstrapping protocol, which securely introduces new devices to the network. Compared to the state-of-the-art, VERSE achieves in-band message integrity verification during secure pairing using only the RF modality without relying on out-of-band channels or extensive human involvement. It guarantees security even when the adversary is capable of fully controlling the wireless channel by annihilating and injecting wireless signals. We study the limits of such advanced wireless attacks and prove that the introduction of multiple legitimate devices can be leveraged to increase the security of the pairing process. We validate our claims via theoretical analysis and extensive experimentations on the USRP platform. We further discuss various implementation aspects such as the effect of time synchronization between devices and the effects of multipath and interference. Note that the elimination of shared secrets, default passwords, and public key infrastructures effectively addresses the related key management challenges when these are considered at scale.},   keywords={authorisation;body area networks;cryptographic protocols;data integrity;message authentication;public key cryptography;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless channels;signal manipulation attacks;wireless devices;hub;secure deployment;body area networks;medical devices;industrial automation sensors;autonomous vehicles;VERSE;physical-layer group message integrity;wireless signal manipulations;man-in-the-middle attacks;shared secrets;authenticated channels;key establishment processes;multiple devices;bootstrapping protocol;in-band message integrity verification;secure pairing;out-of-band channels;extensive human involvement;wireless channel;advanced wireless attacks;multiple legitimate devices;pairing process;secure device bootstrapping;wireless signal injection;wireless signal annihilation;Protocols;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Wireless sensor networks;Authentication;Performance evaluation;Physical layer Security;Wireless Signal Manipulation Attack;Man in the Middle Attack;Key Establishment;Message Integrity Protection;Internet of Things;Secret free;Group Bootstrapping;ON OFF Keying},   doi={10.1109/SP.2018.00055},   ISSN={2375-1207},   month={May},}
