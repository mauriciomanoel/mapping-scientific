abstract={Thailand has become an ageing society. The consequences of the situation appear to be an issue for health organizations to prepare efficient, safe and equitable health care for an aging population. Throughout the past decades, technology has been frequently utilized because it has provided new methods to support the facilitate health care services. In this paper, we studied the health situation of the elderly and proposed the Smart Healthcare system. It consists of a bio-signal measuring prototype (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) and a web application for both doctors and the elderly. It also includes an alert button. Evaluation was performed in two parts, which were qualitative interviewing and quantitative survey. We interviewed three doctors for confirmation regarding their opinion of the system (i.e. usefulness, visualizing data, and suggestions). Doctors replied that the system is useful for the elderly who are unaware of their own health information; consequently, they may unable to control their own health. For visualizing data, doctors normally view the measured data in number format. For displaying result to the elderly, it should be explained in simple statements that are easy to understand or described using color. Moreover, provision of an alert button is a valuable idea for saving lives. For the quantitative survey, we used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the core model to measure the acceptance by the elderly. Thirty 60-80-year-old elderly people participated in the survey. The result indicated that the elderly is perceived the usefulness of the system and were willing to use it unless they found it difficult to learn or understand because of possible negative attitudes toward new technologies.},

title={Tackling Missing Data in Community Health Studies Using Additive LS-SVM Classifier}, 
year={2018}, 
volume={22},

pages={579-587}, 
abstract={Missing data is a common issue in community health and epidemiological studies. Direct removal of samples with missing data can lead to reduced sample size and information bias, which deteriorates the significance of the results. While data imputation methods are available to deal with missing data, they are limited in performance and could introduce noises into the dataset. Instead of data imputation, a novel method based on additive least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed in this paper for predictive modeling when the input features of the model contain missing data. The method also determines simultaneously the influence of the features with missing values on the classification accuracy using the fast leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The performance of the method is evaluated by applying it to predict the quality of life (QOL) of elderly people using health data collected in the community. The dataset involves demographics, socioeconomic status, health history, and the outcomes of health assessments of 444 community-dwelling elderly people, with 5% to 60% of data missing in some of the input features. The QOL is measured using a standard questionnaire of the World Health Organization. Results show that the proposed method outperforms four conventional methods for handling missing data-case deletion, feature deletion, mean imputation, and K-nearest neighbor imputation, with the average QOL prediction accuracy reaching 0.7418. It is potentially a promising technique for tackling missing data in community health research and other applications.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has taken over the business spectrum, and its applications vary widely from agriculture and health care to transportation. A hospital environment can be very stressful, especially for senior citizens and children. With the ever-increasing world population, the conventional patient-doctor appointment has lost its effectiveness. Hence, smart health care becomes very important. Smart health care can be implemented at all levels, starting from temperature monitoring for babies to tracking vital signs in the elderly. The complexity and cost of implementation varies based on the required precision of the individual device, functionalities, and sophistication of the application for which they are used. Smart health care also falls under vertical areas such as very-large-scale integration, embedded system, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. This article discusses the importance, requirements, application of smart health care along with the current industry trends and products. It gives a deeper insight about the different platform across which more research can be pursued in this dynamic domain.},

abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},

abstract={By increasing intelligence in health services, people's quality of life will improve and access to emergency medical services and care for patients and elderly will be faster and easier. Internet of Things (IoT) services can provide health care to a new generation of skilled services that are highly acclaimed. However, there are challenges in this area. One of these challenges includes assurance quality of service (QoS) due to the high volume of information. The existence of programs that produce a large amount of real-time data in terms of velocity and variety has turned this into a big data problem. To overcome these challenges, the researchers recommend the integration of the cloud and the Internet of Things. Due to this, the patient monitoring system is supported by the recent developments mainly by cloud computing and the IoT paradigms, so the integration of the two paradigm contributes significantly to the provision of more quality of services. This paper presents the characteristics of the cloud and the Internet of Things paradigms, which are used in remote healthcare. In addition, to provide smart health services with the best quality, we need to use cloud and IoT integration services, which is definitely one of the challenges of this area. Therefore, in this paper, first, the challenges of quality of service are expressed in the integration of the cloud and the Internet of Things services. Then, the challenges of QoS in smart healthcare services such as the limitation of use of sensor data, big data, lack of standard methods of quality of service and the complexity of cloud and IoT layers are reviewed based on this integration. Finally, a method for maintaining the quality of service in providing smart healthcare services is proposed.},

abstract={Smartphones are used worldwide for a variety of purposes: constant communication, immediate access to a humongous amount of knowledge, effortless ways of posting pictures, feelings and thoughts to name a few. In consequence, smartphones have become our natural life companions and, thanks to the rise of concepts such as mobile health and smart health, will be a linchpin regarding our care. Detecting the appearance of wandering behaviours in the elderly population is crucial in order to tackle the early treatment of mild cognitive impairments. To that end, a number of proposals have appeared, either theoretical methods or practical applications. This paper addresses the assessment of wandering detection methods from different perspectives. First, we review the available datasets in the literature that can be used for benchmarking wandering detection methods. Moreover, we analyse the available datasets using a well-known wandering detection technique, so as to obtain the number of abnormal trajectories with respect to the whole dataset and each individual. Finally, we discuss the properties that a dataset for benchmarking should fulfil.},

abstract={We propose smart home health care system for the realization of smart cities to fulfill the needs of elderly people in order to have continued care. An elderly person should be monitored constantly, specifically if he or she is diagnosed for health-related problems before. In the proposed system, a patient's condition is monitored by using multimodal inputs, specifically, speech and video. Video cameras and microphones are installed in the smart homes; these sensors constantly capture video and speech of the patient, and transmit them to a dedicated cloud. In the cloud, the data are processed, and a classification score on the patient's condition, whether he is normal, tensed, or in pain, is produced. Depending on the condition of the person, the doctors prescribe the person via audio, video or message services, or the caregivers rush to the location for emergency. For data processing in the server, we extract robust and low-dimensional discriminating features from voice and video frames. Experimental results show that the combined modality achieves better accuracy than that using a single modality to correctly classify the patient's condition.},

To provide a better service system for the elders, researchers have used active rule based techniques including Event-Condition-Active (ECA). In this paper, we enhanced ECA to ECA-Sequence (ECA-S) rules to detect abnormal condition in physiological indices. Our method extracts accurate health information from historical sequence data. The ECA-S is used to differentiate burst variations in physiological indices from morbid cases. Our further experiment in giving early warning for diabetic patients shows that ECA-S can deal with the burst abnormal physiological index problem. Finally, an evaluation is made among existing ECA based solutions including prime ECA, ECA-Parameters, ECA-Post-condition and proved that our proposed ECA-S method performs better in health diagnosis quality as compared to others.},

abstract={Smart cities face the challenge of combining sustainable national welfare with high living standards. In the last decades, life expectancy increased globally, leading to various age-related issues in almost all developed countries. Frailty affects elderly who are experiencing daily life limitations due to cognitive and functional impairments and represents a remarkable burden for national health systems. In this paper, we proposed two different predictive models for frailty by exploiting 12 socioclinical databases. Emergency hospitalization or all-cause mortality within a year were used as surrogates of frailty. The first model was able to assign a frailty risk score to each subject older than 65 years old, identifying five different classes for tailor made interventions. The second prediction model assigned a worsening risk score to each subject in the first nonfrail class, namely the probability to move in a higher frailty class within the year. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the whole elderly population of the Municipality of Bologna, Italy. We created a baseline cohort of 95 368 subjects for the frailty risk model and a baseline cohort of 58 789 subjects for the worsening risk model, respectively. To evaluate the predictive ability of our models through calibration and discrimination estimates, we used, respectively, a six-year and a four-year observation period. Good discriminatory power and calibration were obtained, demonstrating a good predictive ability of the models.},

abstract={The growth of the world's population and the dramatic increase in average life expectancy raise awareness of the global burden of elderly diseases. Mild cognitive impairments affect elderly people, which suffer a deterioration of their capabilities, with special regard to memory. Such problems often lead to disorientation or wandering: erratic movements and changes in mobility and behavioural patterns. In this context, an early and automatic detection of wandering symptoms avoids risks and possible damages to these patients, improving their quality of life. However, wandering detection is not trivial, because several factors such as patterns, environment or the severity of the dementia need to be considered. The research community has proposed several techniques, algorithms and technologies in order to properly detect such abnormal behaviours. Moreover, the new health paradigm, Smart Health, opens the door to a new generation of systems and technologies in order to overcome the shortcomings of the classical methods in this field of research. This paper analyses the most relevant wandering detection methods present in the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={China, like many other developed and developing countries in the world, is facing a rapid ageing population. This phenomenon has led to profound impacts on China's national health and welfare system, social stability, economic development, and productivity, and so is forcing the country to adopt new innovative, resourceful and reliable means to offer better health and caring services to the elderly people. Wearable technologies have the potential to aid this struggle, but there is currently very limited understanding on Chinese old people's requirements for using these technologies. Such misunderstanding can lead to severe mismatch between wearable functions and actual user needs, and so minimize the potential and usefulness of wearable technologies. Therefore, this paper aims to address this knowledge gap by reporting on an exploratory study that investigated Chinese older people's user requirements towards wearable healthcare devices. Five focus groups were conducted to collect insights and opinions respectively from five Chinese families. Each family participated in the focus group contained at least 1-2 elderly member, together with 2-4 family members who held caring responsibilities. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the collected qualitative data. The results showed that user requirements of Chinese elderly people contained three main categories, namely healthcare, data privacy and security, and commodity and entertainment needs. The paper concluded that these identified user requirements should be carefully considered by wearable hardware designers, system developers, and service providers if they want their innovative products and services to be accepted by the intended users in the Chinese market.},

abstract={Health Monitoring systems are progressively evolving with the potential to change the way health care is currently delivered. A Smart Health Monitoring System, such as the one designed in this study, aims to automate patient monitoring tasks. In the present study we have designed and developed a GSM (Global System for Mobile) based smart wearable system with 3-axis Accelerometer, 3-lead ECG recording system and real-time NIBP analysis system. The device is capable of detecting sudden fall situations, cardiac abnormalities & hyper/hypotension; thereby rendering it suitable for real-time monitoring, self-diagnosis and remote diagnosis purposes. The system is also capable of sending notifications to healthcare professionals immediately after the detection of any of the aforementioned health abnormalities so that the necessary steps are taken. The complete analysis and evaluation of the signals acquired from the patient have been performed using a software platform: NI LabVIEW. It is a cost-effective, smart and wearable health monitoring system that is of immense importance not only to the elderly and post-operative patients, but also to those residing in remote locations and are incapable of affording expensive healthcare in urban hospitals or clinics.},

abstract={The Portuguese census of 2011 showed that 22,5% of the population of Região Centro was 65 years old or more. The increase in the elderly population leads to the need to promote healthy aging, with autonomy and independence, and preserving the functional capacity. As people get older, injuries and health conditions that impact on their wellbeing must be taken into account, and understanding what is adequate requires specialized knowledge and training. If people are left alone deciding their own activity level, they can be too aggressive and aggravate their injuries, create new ones and refrain themselves in exercising more, or too conservative and in the long run they will have an activity level under their potential and below what is recommended. In this paper we present SmartWalk, a project that aims to create a monitoring system of wellbeing and physical activity in the context of Smart Cities. The project is more than a smartphone application, as it will have health professionals operating the system and will take into consideration contextual and user specific information. The service is about helping people to have the best possible activity level, and do so without disrupting their routines.},

abstract={Obtrusive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most important sleep disorders because it has a direct adverse impact on the quality of life. Intellectual deterioration, decreased psychomotor performance, behavior, and personality disorders are some of the consequences of OSA. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of this disorder is a critical need in healthcare solutions. There are several systems for OSA detection. Nevertheless, despite their promising results, these systems not guiding their treatment. For these reasons, this research presents an innovative system for both to detect and support of treatment of OSA of elderly people by monitoring multiple factors such as sleep environment, sleep status, physical activities, and physiological parameters as well as the use of open data available in smart cities. Our system architecture performs two types of processing. On the one hand, a pre-processing based on rules that enables the sending of real-time notifications to responsible for the care of elderly, in the event of an emergency situation. This pre-processing is essentially based on a fog computing approach implemented in a smart device operating at the edge of the network that additionally offers advanced interoperability services: technical, syntactic, and semantic. On the other hand, a batch data processing that enables a descriptive analysis that statistically details the behavior of the data and a predictive analysis for the development of services, such as predicting the least polluted place to perform outdoor activities. This processing uses big data tools on cloud computing. The performed experiments show a 93.3% of effectivity in the air quality index prediction to guide the OSA treatment. The system's performance has been evaluated in terms of latency. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the pre-processing of data at the edge of the network improves the efficiency of the system.},

abstract={Systems enabling long-term monitoring of physiological data and everyday activities has been the subject of considerable research efforts in the last years, in order to improve the quality of life of patients, elderly people and common citizens at home, out of the hospitalization. With the availability of inexpensive, low power, wireless and integrated devices, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of sensors, which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home, as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. According to the field of application and the end-users involved (healthy people, elderly, people with disabilities), the definition of the parameters (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, activity, body mass, etc.) and the appropriate sensors (electrocardiogram, sphygmomanometer, glucometer, etc.) for their acquisition assume a fundamental role. One of the goals of the Italian project Health@Home is to create a network of health sensors and home automation devices to monitor the user's status within the home environment. We present a candidate implementation of such a system, describing the software architecture and the selected components, and a testbed of the architecture, realized in a lab room and used for a preliminary experimental study involving seven users.},

abstract={The ever-growing life expectancy of people requires the adoption of proper solutions for addressing the particular needs of elderly people in a sustainable way, both from service provision and economic point of view. Mild cognitive impairments and frailty are typical examples of elderly conditions which, if not timely addressed, can turn out into more complex diseases that are harder and costlier to treat. Information and communication technologies, and in particular Internet of Things technologies, can foster the creation of monitoring and intervention systems, both on an ambient-assisted living and smart city scope, for early detecting behavioral changes in elderly people. This allows to timely detect any potential risky situation and properly intervene, with benefits in terms of treatment's costs. In this context, as part of the H2020-funded City4Age project, this paper presents the data capturing and data management layers of the whole City4Age platform. In particular, this paper deals with an unobtrusive data gathering system implementation to collect data about daily activities of elderly people, and with the implementation of the related linked open data (LOD)-based data management system. The collected data are then used by other layers of the platform to perform risk detection algorithms and generate the proper customized interventions. Through the validation of some use-cases, it is demonstrated how this scalable approach, also characterized by unobtrusive and low-cost sensing technologies, can produce data with a high level of abstraction useful to define a risk profile of each elderly person.},

abstract={Smart health home systems and assisted living architectures rely on severely energy-constrained sensing devices, such as wearable sensors, for the generation of data and their reliable wireless communication to a central location. However, the need for recharging the battery regularly constitutes a maintenance burden that hinders the long-term cost-effectiveness of these systems, especially for health-oriented applications that target people in need, such as the elderly or the chronically ill. These sensing systems generate raw data that is processed into knowledge by reasoning and machine learning algorithms. This paper investigates the benefits of embedded machine learning, i.e. executing this knowledge extraction on the wearable sensor, instead of communicating abundant raw data over the low power network. Focusing on a simple classification task and using an accelerometer-based wearable sensor, we demonstrate that embedded machine learning has the potential to reduce the radio and processor duty cycle by several orders of magnitude; and, thus, substantially extend the battery lifetime of resource-constrained wearable sensors.},

abstract={Cities increasingly face challenges related to pollution, efficient use of resources (e.g. water, energy) and ensuring a good quality of life for its citizens. Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives. A need for inter-continental automated testing facilities such as those developed by TRESCIMO is identified through which integrated experiments can be conducted to provide insight and answers.},

These sensors must also be precise, reliable, easy-to-use, and of small dimensions. For monitoring the quality of drinking water, the two most critical parameters are pH and chlorine. In the first part of the presentation, we describe our work on developing small-size, flexible, easy-to-use, and low-cost pH and chlorine sensors that are also very sensitive and reliable. We also describe our on-going work to optimize the physical structures and manufacturing conditions for miniaturized sensing devices that are integrated with preprocessing modules and electronics towards smart sensors. In the second challenge related to healthcare, the situation is compounded by the fact that over the past century, we have seen a continual increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public health, nutrition, medicine and personal hygiene. However, this phenomenal success is now coupled with aging population demographics and falling birth rates. In fact, never before in human history have we been confronted with such a large aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions for the healthcare, social needs and well-being of the elderly. Here, we describe our work in which we use advances in information technology, wireless communication, web-based technologies and autonomics, to develop new, smart and cost-effective solutions for the health wellness of the elderly. Such solutions would enable elderly to lead independent lifestyles in their own homes while being non-invasively, non-intrusively and seamlessly monitored for the early detection of symptoms, so diseases can be treated earlier than in later stages as is currently done; to promote health wellness; as well as to treat chronic illnesses. Through a few examples related to walking, sleeping and vital signs sensing, we will describe our ongoing work as well as the challenges we have uncovered. In particular, we will focus on the critical role of information technology (IT) in developing innovative, low-cost and high impacting solutions to the pending elderly demographic crisis in a smart home. Finally, we will describe the role of the practical solutions being developed for these two grand engineering challenges and their impact in the evolution of smart cities.},

abstract={The success of providing smart healthcare services in ambient assisted living (AAL) largely depends on an effective prediction of situations in the environment. Situation awareness in AAL is to determine the environment smartness by perceiving information related to the surroundings and human behavioral changes. In AAL environment, there are plenty of ways to collect data about its inhabitants, such as through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The collected data are complicated enough to go for an efficient processing in perceiving the situation. This paper gives an overview of the existing research results in multimodal data analysis in AAL environment to improve the living environment of the seniors, and it attempts to bring efficiency in complex event processing for real-time situational awareness. This paper thus considers multimodal sensing for detection of current situations as well as to predict future situations using decision-tree and association analysis algorithms. To illustrate the proposed approach, we consider elderly activity recognition in the AAL environment.},

Due to the ageing of the population, age-related illnesses such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are becoming commonplace and healthcare systems struggle to improve the quality of life of patients and carers. Wandering and disorientation are common symptoms amongst patients with MCI, and they could lead to fatal outcomes. In this article we propose a wandering detection technique based on the analysis of randomness in patients' trajectories, which are gathered by means of standard low-cost mobile phones with GPS.},

abstract={With advancements in wireless technologies, location based services (LBS) have become ubiquitous and are fundamental to services that provide emergency response to those that enhance the quality of daily life. Location tracking applications include traffic congestion management, waste management, indoor navigation in malls/airports, receiving coupons/advertisements by retailers, applications to allow parents to track their children, providing centimeter-level guidance to visually impaired users in indoor environments etc. Location tracking also enables applications in device-free situations - intrusion detection by means of tracking people and their movements through walls, monitoring the heartbeat of a person(ex: elderly citizen) through walls etc. In conjunction with location based services, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) provides rich contextual information which is key to the scalability of smart cities. Managing these technologies along with establishing effective countermeasures against security and privacy concerns of individual citizens as well as service providers and government agencies is essential for their adoption. In this paper we envision a feature of the emergency response system of a smart city whereby critical contextual information from the emergency site is made available to the emergency service provider to enable effective first response strategy. We use the example of a smart building with an infrastructure that consists of an indoor hybrid wireless environment for identifying individuals, tracking their location, monitoring vital statistics and measuring ambient conditions. This information is critical to rescue teams and paramedics. We provide an architecture that addresses the security and privacy issues associated with the highly sensitive information generated by this system.},

abstract={Falling is a major cause of death among elders. To detect falls, numerous approaches have been proposed in the past decade, including computer-vision based image processing, wearable sensors, and acoustic signal processing, etc. Though the recent advancement in infra-red LED, depth camera, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors and machine learning algorithms may have enlarged the application scope, the privacy intrusion and lack of convenience still remain to be open issues which prevent these systems from large deployment. A novel Sensing-Fi system described in this paper aims to overcome such deficiencies. The system design is comprised of harnessing Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) coupled with ground-mounted accelerometer to detect floor vibration, hence the system is completely passive and non-invasive, i.e., the user is not required to wear the technology contrary to wearable accelerometers. In addition, contrary to the existing standalone Wi-Fi CSI fall detection systems, it overcomes the constraint by which only one user can be present in the room. The system has shown promising results with 95% accuracy.},

abstract={An important function for a smart health care system, aiming to maximize safety and comfort to elderly or people with dysfunctional legs, is the automatic detection of a wheelchair captured from a visual surveillance system. In this paper, we proposed a method for detecting a two-dimensional wheelchair image using a combination of the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The proposed method consists of three main steps: (i). foreground segmentation, (ii). feature vector extraction, and (iii). wheelchair detection. The GMMs technique was used to extract a moving object from a background, while the underlying feature vectors of the moving objects were obtained using the HOG method. Finally, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) was implemented to classify a wheelchair object. We implemented 1,217 images for evaluating the performance of our proposed method which results in 86.01% of the accuracy rate. The advantage of our proposed approach is that it can detect a wheelchair effectively without any knowledge or prior information of the previous frames.},

abstract={In a context of a rapidly growing population of elderly people, this paper introduces a novel method for behavioural anomaly detection relying on a self-organized learning process. This method first models the Circadian Activity Rhythm of a set of sensors and compares it to a nominal profile to determine variations in patients' activities. The anomalies are detected by a multi-agent system as a linear relation of those variations, weighted by influence parameters. The problem of adaptation to a particular patient then becomes the problem of learning the adequate influence parameters. Those influence parameters are self-adjusted, using feedback provided at any time by the medical staff. This approach is evaluated on a synthetic environment and results show both the capacity to effectively learn influence parameters and the resilience of this system to parameter size. Details on the ongoing real-world experimentation are provided.},

The applications of WBAN includes several areas such as smart health care, assisted elderly living and emergency response. In the WBAN, obtaining an acceptable QoS performance is extremely important due to its relation with human health and emergency situation. The QoS requirements of a sensor in WBAN is tightly related to the context of its application. Therefore, successful design of a QoS frameworks needs to be application context-aware. In this paper, we propose a contexta-ware framework to guarantee the QoS requirements of the sensor nodes in the WBAN. Our framework is implemented as a separate module which is independent of the application layer and can be utilized for different medical applications. Additionally, our framework enables the medical application to dynamically adapt to the QoS changes due to the nature of application and patient's health status.},

abstract={The dual-task paradigm is a promising procedure for estimating cognitive status and may also be collaterally used to reduce cognitive decline and prevent dementia. In this paper, we use the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) to the assess cognitive status in the elderly as a reference and investigate the potential of using machine learning for early detecting cognitive impairment in the elderly. Although many studies have suggested that dual-task performance, in which participants perform a cognitive task while walking, is associated with cognition, they only considered the correlation between cognitive parameters and simple gait feature, such as gait speed, through the statistical analysis. We instead use a Kinect sensor to capture participants' whole-body movements and extract a rich gait feature that has the ability to exhibit different tendencies of movements between healthy and cognitive-impaired elderlies. In our experiments, a classifier based on the dual-task gait feature achieved a higher performance than the one based on the single-task feature; the performance of the rich gait feature was better than that of a simple one, and; an optimal detection performance was achieved with an MMSE cutoff score of 25. We positively validated that the proposed method could early detect elderly with lower MMSE scores based on dual-task gait feature with a promising performance. Our approach can support early and automated diagnosis of cognitive impairment.},

abstract={One of Smart City's goals is to reduce healthcare spending, also by prolonging the active and independent lives of the elderly. Often the elderly live alone; their lifestyle, including proper adherence to therapies, is often controlled by relatives or friends or caregivers by daily or weekly telephone calls. In addition to investigating energy and environment infrastructure and services, the project Brescia Smart Living wants to experience new remote monitoring services. The elderly is constantly monitored by a system of wearable and home sensors; a smartphone, acting as a home gateway, stores and elaborates data and reports events to one or more people chosen by the elderly person. The main result of the project is a very versatile and scalable sensory system, thanks to a framework that simplifies the management of several external devices in Android applications. An ambient assisted living application is presented, showing how the life style of an elderly person can be monitored in a non-invasive way.},

title={Effect of car driving on quality of life for aged people},

volume={},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={It is recognized that car driving might have a bad influence to health, due to the lack of physical exercises, compared with the public transportation modes or active travel such as walking and cycling. However, car driving might be able to prevent a decline in physical ability, especially for aged people, since drivers are required to do physical reactions including recognition, judgement, and operation in order to drive the car. This study aims to investigate and find solutions to transport problems in super aging society. We analyzed the relationship between the driving conditions and the life satisfaction or physical activity as a preliminary study to reveal the anti-aging effect of car driving. As the conclusion, it is found that with the increase of driving frequency, the drivers have higher life satisfaction, and feel fewer burdens, since higher frequency of driving has a lower degradation effect of capability to process visual information.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) will facilitate a wide variety of applications in different domains, such as smart cities, smart grids, industrial automation (Industry 4.0), smart driving, assistance of the elderly, and home automation. Billions of heterogeneous smart devices with different application requirements will be connected to the networks and will generate huge aggregated volumes of data that will be processed in distributed cloud infrastructures. On the other hand, there is also a general trend to deploy functions as software (SW) instances in cloud infrastructures [e.g., network function virtualization (NFV) or mobile edge computing (MEC)]. Thus, the next generation of mobile networks, the fifth-generation (5G), will need not only to develop new radio interfaces or waveforms to cope with the expected traffic growth but also to integrate heterogeneous networks from end to end (E2E) with distributed cloud resources to deliver E2E IoT and mobile services. This article presents the E2E 5G platform that is being developed by the Centre Tecnol?gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), the first known platform capable of reproducing such an ambitious scenario.},

abstract={Japan has emphasized in the strategy of smart city which we believe an inevitable trend for the social innovation of Japanese cities. The current trend of smart tourism is becoming one of the important part for the urban renovation due to integration of ICT technology in tourism. However, there are plenty of regions which are facing different kinds of social problems. For example, most of the cities in Hokkaido are facing population decline, decreasing birthrate and rapid aging population. Similarly, most of the youth from rural cities migrate to bigger cities leading to burden for urban communities. In this social context, the smart tourism is an important part and a practical attempt of the smart city strategy. This new emerging trend of smart tourism nicely fits with the economic growth of Japan and could become a tool for hospitality transformation into the new height. On the basis of these developments, this research attempt to contribute to address these issues, enhanced smart tourism and offers solution methodologies by introducing IoT based applications. Furthermore, this research attempts to combine STPF for the development of regional tourism thereby contributing to revitalize the regional development. This strategy attempts to combine the Internet of Things (IoT) technology with the development of the smart tourism industry and smart tourism cities. This research have attempted to combine IoT and smart tourism providing an IoT information technology public platform for regional revival.},

abstract={This paper presents a step toward the development of a data-centric approach to prevention of Mild Cognitive Impairment and frailty in the elderly population. The scientific literature provides a large number of “indicators” for assessing the quality of behavior for aged individuals, in order to predict possible decaying. On the opposite side, a large variety of sensors and datasets today allows the effective collection of elementary data about actions performed by individuals. This paper proposes to build a bridge between these two sides. In a bottom-up vision, data from sensors and smart cities' datasets are aggregated and interpreted in a way that leads to reliable assessment of the indicators. In a top-down vision, indicators are translated into data analysis. The work described in this paper is part of City4age, a project partially funded by the EU within the H2020 Programme.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1-9}, 
abstract={This paper presents the fields results in non-obtrusive life sign monitoring performed using a low emission, compact high frequency Doppler radar, which can detect body movements associated with breathing and the heart beating. Such a system is particularly useful where attaching sensors to the body is undesirable; for example, monitoring detainees in a prison who are at risk of suicide, self-harm, and medical complications due to drugs or alcohol. This method of monitoring can aid greatly in situations where it can be difficult to ascertain a person's status, such as a person who is sleeping under a blanket. While a breathing and cardiac signal is visible in the Doppler radar signal, it can be corrupted by noise and interference by so-called nuisance signals (e.g., movements associated with fans, water flowing from faucets and toilets, door micro-motion, light fixture ballast vibration and other body movements). This work is part of a three-year project that involves four organizations; CSC (end-user), KG Spectrum (radar-based perimeter intrusion detection systems), Carleton-University (bio-medical) and Ottawa-University (signal processing). The final goal is to develop a robust system for detection of attempted suicide events in prisons in time to allow for lifesaving interventions. This has been done in a novel way by installing one high range (75cm) spacial resolution, scanning antenna and high frequency (24.125GHz) radars in prison cells and by processing signals extracted from the radars in real-time. This unique radar architecture allows the usage of novel signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms to locate the subject and removing interference and reliably estimate breathing and heartbeat signals, even when the subject is non-stationary and then to produce an alarm when these signals cannot be observed or significant changes, in breathing pattern or heart rate pattern, representing abnormal behavior have been detected within the observation cell. This research project is performing time, frequency and pattern domain analysis on the radar data and explores signal processing approaches for the robust and accurate detection and estimation of the respiratory with heartbeat rate. Outcome of this research will be useful in mitigating the risks associated with detainees by providing a life sign monitoring approach that can help enable timely responses. Such a system can also find application in smart health homes for monitoring people at risk, such as the elderly or infants, as well as in psychological institution. In addition to presenting the results of filed trial, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using high frequency, high range resolution and high sampling rate as a mean to geo-localize the source of movement within the prison cells, thereby increasing the efficiency of the signal processing eliminating the need to process on overall volume wise integrated Doppler signal. The use of geo-localization provides natural discrimination of source of nuisance, allowing the signal processor focusing on Doppler signal solely produced by the inmate heart beat and breathing responses.},
